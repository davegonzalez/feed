        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ben Sandofsky, writing for the Halide blog:
The iPhone 13 Pro features a new camera capable of focusing closer
than ever before — less than an inch away. This opens a whole new
dimension for iPhone photographers, but it’s not without
surprises. Let’s take a tour of what this lens unlocks, some
clever details you might miss in its implementation, why its
“automatic” nature can catch you off guard, and much more. At the
end, we have a special surprise for you — especially those not
using an iPhone 13 Pro.
I’ll spoil it: Halide 2.5 adds a nifty macro mode for all recent iPhones, not just the iPhone 13 Pro. But of course, it works best on the iPhone 13 Pro, where it offers manual control over focus distance — useful for macro situations like trying to focus on a window pane instead of through it.

Let the numbers hang from the Farg!
 The Flyers, as an organisation, are second to none at making their alumni feel as if they are part of a pseudo family.
Though there is hardly a metric to judge this characteristic on, the Flyers, at least from observation, do a very good job at honoring their past players. Especially when they make an appearance in front of a rocking Wells Fargo Center crowd, Philadelphia knows how to make the greats of the past feel welcome, and boy do the Flyers know this.
However, there’s one aspect of honors which the Flyers can bestow that is rarely used, and may not be used for some time: jersey retirement. The last Flyer to have his jersey number retired was Eric Lindros back in 2018, and since the Flyers primarily ret…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kif Leswing, reporting last night for CNBC:
Apple filed a notice of appeal in the Epic Games case and is
asking for a stay on the injunction that lets developers add
in-app links to payment websites, according to company
representatives and documents filed on Friday.
If Apple wins the stay, which will be decided by a judge in
November, a rule change potentially allowing developers to
circumvent App Store fees of 15% to 30% may not take effect
until appeals in the case have finished, a process that could
take years.
Apple won everything in the case but that one point, but they’d like to win that point too.

Burst of energy in the middle of the second period not enough to overcome the other 50 minutes of the game.
 Alain Vigneault keeps insisting that his Flyers are getting closer — but a familiar theme keeps showing up despite those claims. 
That theme? An inability to churn out a full 60 minutes of hockey. Not 10 or 20 minutes, or even 40 — but a full 60 minutes. 
Sure it’s preseason, and the points don’t matter, but Vigneault’s Flyers turned in less than 20 minutes of quality in last night’s 5-3 loss to the Capitals. That effort, which might have been closer to the lower end of the spectrum, has followed a preseason full of half-empty efforts from the Flyers. 
The only question is just how long the Flyers will last.

 The Sims 4 has lots of downloadable content in the forms of Expansion Packs, Game Packs, Stuff Packs, and more recently, Kits. These are all paid packages that add a plethora of new content to the game, whether it’s the ability to have a hot tub in your yard or the addition of magic and spells. Our The Sims 4 DLC guide details the best Expansion Packs, Game Packs, and Stuff Packs, according to the biggest Sims fans at Polygon.
The Sims 4 DLC, explained and priced
Expansion Packs typically add new gameplay systems, like seasons or the ability to own retail stores, while also adding tons of hairstyles, clothing, and furnishing objects. They cost $39.99.

The Flyers defenseman has terrible social media game comparatively.
 Social media is a great tool to absolutely lose some hours sinking your teeth into disheartening profiles or simply uploading the same thing over and over again in some mind-numbing ritual to get all of those precious little bursts of dopamine. For hockey players, it’s simply a place to show off fish, dogs, blonde partners, and warm-up shots.
So I was not surprised to find out that Philadelphia Flyers defenseman Ivan Provorov’s dog, Drake (a very good boy), is closing in on the top-pairing blueliner in terms of followers on Instagram.

Can’t expect to win a hockey game when you only play well for ten minutes or so, fellas.
 Wrapping up the preseason, the Washington Capitals and your Philadelphia Flyers met tonight to play a hockey game. Surprisingly, it was actually pretty eventful, featuring goals, fighting, and other stuff. What happened, who were the players to watch, and why did this game matter? All of that and more below.
What went right?
Despite a dismal first period, the Flyers got things cooking midway through the second frame and flashed some legitimately exciting finishing ability. Claude Giroux opened the scoring after a dominant shift from the top line, dunking home a rebound with a smooth, patient approach:

Fans say the change goes against a pledge to only sell cosmetics
 Marvel’s Avengers is now selling XP boosters — paid consumable items called Hero’s Catalysts in the game’s marketplace — as part of an update to Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics’ game that rolled out Thursday. The change isn’t sitting well with Marvel’s Avengers players, who say that the developer has gone back on its pledge to only offer paid microtransactions for cosmetic items, like skins and other flourishes.
The latest patch for Marvel’s Avengers updated the in-game marketplace to add a Consumable category, which now sells Hero’s Catalysts and Fragment Extractors, two consumable items that already existed in the game. Previously, the Marketplace only sold cosmetic items, like…]]></summary>

But are these game-changing innovations in the post-Jobs era?
“Apple lost the ability to bring out products that could
revolutionize a market,” said Tech industry analyst Rob Enderle of
Enderle Group. “They became a financially-focused company very
effective at milking its faithful users,” he added.
Enderle, in May 2015 — mere weeks after Apple Watch shipped — declared it “obsolete” and a month later called it a “failure”.
Keep in mind I linked earlier today to a survey that suggests 30 percent of U.S. teenagers now wear an Apple Watch.

In 1997, Jobs rejoined a struggling Apple after it acquired Next

(as Jobs was evaluating Apple’s Mac clone licensing project,
which he ultimately shut down). Jobs and his team had ported the
Mac software, based on Next’s Mach operating system, and had it
running on the Intel x86 chips that powered Dell PCs. Jobs offered
to license the Mac OS to Dell, telling him he could give PC buyers
a choice of Apple’s software or Microsoft’s Windows OS installed
on their machine.
“He said, look at this — we’ve got this Dell desktop and
it’s running Mac OS,” Dell tells me. “Why don’t you license
the Mac OS?”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cultured Code’s renowned to-do app Things added support for Markdown back in August. It’s really well done. You might think that as the creator of Markdown, that I’m in favor of seeing it in use everywhere. That is wrong. In fact, in recent years I think Markdown is in use in far too many places where something truly WYSIWYG is called for.
Things does Markdown right. It doesn’t hide the Markdown formatting characters, it just styles them. Effectively, the notes field for tasks in Things is still just plain text. It’s just styled nicely if you write that plain text in Markdown. That’s the right way to do Markdown. Don’t hide the formatting characters; just style/color them.

All the cards a Cleaner could ask for
 Back 4 Blood has a big warning if you attempt to jump in solo, and it’s started to freak some players out. But have no fear, zombie loners: Back 4 Blood with bots isn’t as bad as it sounds. 
If you go into the menu and select Solo Campaign in Back 4 Blood, you’ll see a scary message:
Uses solo decks created in the Fort Hope deck menu. Maps and objectives will be adjusted. Matchmaking and player invites are disabled. Earning Supply Points is disabled. Stat tracking is disabled. Earning progress towards Accomplishments is disabled.

All of that sounds very punishing, like Turtle Rock Studios would really rather you not experience its game this way. But a solo campaign is actually…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the release of iOS 15.0.1 on October 1, Apple has stopped signing iOS 15.0, the previously available version of iOS that saw a public release on September 20. With iOS 15.0 no longer being signed, it is not possible to downgrade to that version if you've already updated to iOS 15.0.1.





Apple last week stopped signing iOS 14.8 as well, which means iOS 15.0.1 is the only publicly available version of iOS at this time, and those who have upgraded to iOS 15 cannot downgrade to iOS 14.



Apple routinely stops signing older versions of software updates after new releases come out in order to encourage customers to keep their operating systems up to date.



iOS 15.0 marks a  major version update introducing Focus Mode, Live Text, on-device Siri, iCloud+, Safari changes, and tons more, with details available in our iOS 15 roundup.



iOS 15.0.1 introduced a fix for a bug that prevented an authenticated Apple Watch from being used to unlock an iPhone 13 model when wearing a face mask. It also addressed a bug that could cause the Settings app to incorrectly display a storage full alert and it fixed a bug with audio meditations for Fitness+ subscribers.

Turtle Rock Studios’ modernized zombie shooter keeps it fresh
 If you’ve never fought off a horde of zombies while Dick Dale’s (and Pulp Fiction’s) “Misirlou” blares on a beat-to-shit jukebox, by all means, give it a go. That’s how one of the missions toward the middle of Back 4 Blood’s first act ends. While a group of survivors tries to escape by bus, you and your crew — the Cleaners — get to play bait. And nothing captures the attention of zombies quite like surf rock. 
The jukebox defense is a rare moment in Back 4 Blood where you get to just “be cool, Honey Bunny” instead of stressed. As fans of Left 4 Dead, the spiritual predecessor to Back 4 Blood, know, the zombie horde is something to take seriously. And th…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In September 2021, Apple introduced the Apple Watch Series 7, featuring larger displays, improved durability, and faster charging. This came one year after Apple unveiled the Apple Watch SE, a low-cost Apple Watch option that still offers many of the Apple Watch features that have made the device so popular over the years.





The ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ starts at $399, while the ‌Apple Watch SE‌ is priced much more competitively at $279. As these two models share many key features, including design, water resistance, and an optical heart sensor, it may not be immediately obvious which model is better for you. Is it worth purchasing the cheaper model with fewer features? Our guide answers the question of how to decide which of these two Apple Watch models is best for you.

The end is near!
 We’ve reached the end, folks! The Flyers are closing out their preseason with a game against the Capitals. The last time we saw the Capitals, the Flyers picked up their first (and only) win of the preseason over them. The Caps were without many of their top contributors in that game, so the Flyers were able to take advantage of that, but they likely won't have the same chance tonight. It’s the last tune-up before the regular season, and all of the regulars are back in the mix. The first real test of what this team, in its most complete form, can do is here.

Meet the Chemtech and Hextech Dragons
 League of Legends works on a seasonal model, where developer Riot Games starts off a fresh year with lots of changes to the competitive game. This upcoming preseason is no exception, and fans can expect big changes to Summoner’s Rift on PC. 
On Thursday, Riot released a video called “Preseason 2022 and the State of the Game,” in which the developer discussed new champion balance — and admitted that some recent champions have had a few too many tools in their belt — as well as new mythic and legendary items, changes to the runes system, new bounties for objectives and towers, and the star of the preview: some wild new dragons.


Dragons are a powerful map objective. They spawn in the river pit on the bottom side of the map, and can come in one of a few elemental varieties. Each elemental dragon changes the terrain of the map, and offers buffs when killed, making it an important task for teams to prioritize.
Preseason 2022 is adding two new dragons. The Hextech Dragon offers gates around the map that allow for teleportation. The Chemtech Dragon grants players extra damage when their health is low, and when they die, they get a second shot at killing their enemies with a short-lived ghost form. In addition, the Chemtech Dragon creates camouflage zones around the map to hide teams. Sneaky!
Preseason 2022 will be available on the game’s test environment in a couple of weeks, and Riot will dial back these new changes if they disrupt the game a little too much. Right now, League of Legends esports teams are competing in the game’s yearly Worlds tournament. Arcane, a television series that explores Hextech and Chemtech in the cities of Zaun and Piltover, will debut on Netflix in November.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From 2019 to 2021, a small Spanish football team was renamed Flat Earth FC, both as a publicity stunt and because club president Javi Poves couldn’t understand how water “curves”.
“Football is the most popular sport and has the most impact worldwide, so creating a club dedicated to the flat earth movement is the best way to have a constant presence in the media,” said Poves earlier this year. “Flat Earth FC is the first football club whose followers are united by the most important thing, which is an idea.”
The club’s crest is now a circular image of the earth, pressed flat on to all kits, and fans are encouraged to spark regular conversations in their pursuit of answers from the powers that be. The team mascot? An astronaut. It’s a radical move, but the club is bringing in supporters from afar. “It’s really amazing to be part of this amazing movement,” says Flat Earth player Mario Cardete. “I think it’s more than a club.”


During the pandemic, the club also became anti-mask and anti-vax — because conspiracy theories come in price-saving 3-packs, I guess? Poves resigned in late 2020 and the club was renamed and then purchased by a larger club to become their reserve team. The Earth remains round.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Philip Elmer-DeWitt:
From a note to clients by analyst Harsh Kumar that landed on my
desktop Tuesday:
Apple’s share of smartphone ownership remains near record highs in
Piper Sandler’s Taking Stock with Teens Fall 2021 survey (here).
Of the ~10,000 respondents, 87% have an iPhone, which is slightly
below the 88% record set in the Spring 2021 survey. In addition,
the iPhone could return to record highs due to the 88% purchase
intention among teens. […]
A record 30% of teens own an Apple Watch in the Fall 2021 survey.
Apple also has 86% market share among teen smart watch owners.
Larissa Faw, writing for Forbes in January 2013:
Ultimately, in the eyes of today’s youth, massive popularity has
watered down Apple’s coolness. “Teens are telling us Apple is
done,” says Tina Wells of the youth marketing agency Buzz
Marketing Group. “Apple has done a great job of embracing Gen X
and older [Millennials], but I don’t think they are connecting
with Millennial kids. [They’re] all about Surface tablets/laptops
and Galaxy.”

Growth comes in the form of little moments 
 In Sable, you can sit and enjoy the view. No, not just stand there until an idle animation has your character pop a squat. You can press a button to make the red-cloaked main character sit down cross-legged. This little flourish isn’t key to completing the game — you don’t need it for quests, or to solve puzzles — but it captures the ethos of the game perfectly. Sable’s world is gorgeous and vast, and part of the joy of playing is simply taking a moment to sit and take it all in.
Sable is the debut game from Shedworks — a two-person team based out of the U.K. consisting of Daniel Fineberg and Gregorios Kythreotis. It’s a sweeping, third-person open-world adventure set in a vast desert landscape where you play …]]></summary>

As he explained on Behance, Naumann’s process for designing these is surprisingly simple — he zooms way in on RGB noise to generate a background gradient, blurs the logo, and then refracts the background using the height map. Cool! (via moss & fog)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Andrei Frumusanu, writing for AnandTech:
In the GPU side, Apple’s peak performance improvements are off the
charts, with a combination of a new larger GPU, new architecture,
and the larger system cache that helps both performance as well as
efficiency.
Apple’s iPhone component design seems to be limiting the SoC from
achieving even better results, especially the newer Pro models,
however even with that being said and done, Apple remains far
above the competition in terms of performance and efficiency.
Overall, while the A15 isn’t the brute force iteration we’ve
become used to from Apple in recent years, it very much comes with
substantial generational gains that allow it to be a notably
better SoC than the A14. In the end, it seems like Apple’s SoC
team has executed well after all.
A thorough review, as usual. Interesting to contrast with Dylan Patel’s much-publicized “Apple CPU Gains Grind to a Halt and the Future Looks Dim” hot take last month, just after the Apple event. The A15 seems more about efficiency — and thus extending battery life — than going faster, but it does go faster, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Apple Watch Series 7 just became available for pre-order today, and while there are some carrier deals linked to activating cellular service, we're also starting to see the first straight cash discounts on the new models thanks to Expercom.



Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Expercom. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.



You'll need to sign into your Expercom account to access the special pricing and some models are already selling out, but in general, you'll see the following prices and availability for aluminum models at the time of publication:




41mm GPS - $379.05, down from $399 (All colors)


41mm GPS + Cellular - $474.05, down from $499 (All colors except Red)


45mm GPS - $407.55, down from $429 (All colors)


45mm GPS + Cellular - $502.55, down from $529 (Midnight and Blue)


Expercom is currently quoting shipping estimates of 3–6 weeks for new orders, which may not be much different than ordering from Apple considering shipping on some models quickly slipped into November.

GTA 3, Vice City, and San Andreas get updated in The Definitive Edition
 Grand Theft Auto 3, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas are being updated and re-released on modern platforms later this year, Rockstar Games announced Friday, confirming a series of leaks. The trio of groundbreaking GTA games will collected as Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy — The Definitive Edition, and will feature improved visuals and other enhancements.
Rockstar’s collection promises “across-the-board upgrades including graphical improvements and modern gameplay enhancements” for all three games, “while still maintaining the classic look and feel of the originals.” Rockstar promises more details in the coming weeks, and warns that it will begin removing existing versions of those classic GTA games from digital retailers next week.
Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy — The Definitive Edition is coming to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC (via the Rockstar Games Launcher), Xbox One, and Xbox Series X in 2021. The collection is also coming to Android and iOS devices in 2022.
The release of Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy — The Definitive Edition is timed with the 20th anniversary of Grand Theft Auto 3’s original release on PlayStation 2. Rockstar said on its website that it plans to celebrate the anniversary in Grand Theft Auto Online, promising commemorative clothing and liveries, and teasing “some unusual activity occurring in and around Southern San Andreas.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Apple Watch Series 6, introduced by Apple in September of last year, has been discontinued following the launch of the new Apple Watch Series 7.





Following pre-orders of the Apple Watch Series 7 opening up earlier today, Apple has removed the Series 6 from its website, no longer offering it to purchase for customers. The ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ replaces the Series 6 and now leaves the Apple Watch SE, Apple Watch Series 3, and Series 7 in the lineup.



Apple announced the Series 7 earlier last month but declined to offer availability dates until earlier this week. Between the Series 7's announcement and pre-orders, Apple kept the Apple Watch Series 6 available for purchase on its website, but many models were unavailable and out of stock.



The Series 7 is Apple's most high-end Apple Watch model, featuring advanced health features and display technology. The Series 7 starts at $399, with the most expensive configuration having a $1499 price tag. 



The ‌Apple Watch SE‌ is the mid-level Apple Watch model; starting at $279, the SE offers customers basic Apple Watch features without advanced functionality, such as a blood oxygen sensor. The Apple Watch Series 3, introduced five years ago, remarkably remains in the Apple Watch lineup and starts at just $199.

        <updated>2021-10-08T13:56:02.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple this month started including 7-day complimentary AppleCare+ coverage with new products purchased through its stores in Australia, including any new Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV, AirPods, HomePod mini, and more. The complimentary coverage is automatically included with the purchase of a qualifying new Apple product.





The addition was brought to our attention today by MacRumors reader Jack Jacobs, but based on recent updates to the AppleCare+ terms and conditions in Australia, it appears the change was implemented last week, on September 30.



The complimentary AppleCare+ period provides the same coverage as a paid AppleCare+ plan, including coverage for up to two incidents of accidental damage, according to the terms and conditions. After the complimentary coverage expires, customers may purchase AppleCare+ as a one-time purchase or on a monthly basis.



It's unclear why Apple implemented this change, but it could relate to strong warranty protections under Australian Consumer Law. The complimentary AppleCare+ coverage is not available in the United States or other countries that we checked.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple Watch Series 7 pre-orders began minutes ago and some configurations are already facing extended delivery estimates into November on Apple's online store in the United States, including some aluminum and stainless steel options.





Some customers have expressed their frustration that Apple did not provide more details on Series 7 configurations and pricing prior to pre-orders beginning, forcing some people to decide which model they wanted to purchase in the heat of the moment. For customers who did not manage to pre-order their desired Apple Watch for launch day delivery, some configurations will likely be available for Apple Store pickup on launch day.



Apple Watch Series 7 pricing starts at $399 for aluminum models, $699 for stainless steel models, and $799 for titanium models. Apple has finally updated its Apple Watch Studio page that helps with choosing a case, size, and band, and the Apple Watch comparison page is also now updated to reflect the Series 7's tech specs.



Apple Watch Series 7 will begin arriving to customers and launch in stores on Friday, October 15.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, pre-orders for the Apple Watch Series 7 began on Apple.com as well as on participating carrier websites. Similar to years past, the launch of a new Apple Watch is seeing a few solid day one discounts from carriers like AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile/Sprint.



Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.



For all pre-orders, the Apple Watch Series 7 can be ordered today, and it will begin shipping (and be available in stores) on October 15.



AT&T


AT&T's offer for the new Apple Watch requires you to purchase two models, and then you'll get $200 off in bill credits. This offer supports the Series 3 (up to $289.99), Series 4 (up to $699.99), Series 5 (up to $749.99), Series 6 (up to $799.99), SE (up to $359.99), and Series 7 (up to $799.99).



You'll need to buy two Apple Watch models, and place both on a qualifying installment plan with AT&T. The Apple Watch purchases must be two new lines or a new line and an upgraded line. Certified refurbished watches are excluded from this deal.



After purchasing, your $200 credit will begin within three billing cycles, applied in equal amounts over the entire installment plan term. 



Verizon/T-Mobile/Sprint


When purchasing the Apple Watch Series 7 directly from Apple.com (or at an Apple Store) and activating it on a new line with Verizon, T-Mobile, or Sprint, you can get a $100 e-gift card.

There were no major design changes to the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ as was rumored, but the new models feature a larger display with slimmer bezels and new 41mm and 45mm case sizes.



Charging is 33 percent faster thanks to efficiency improvements, and Apple is using a more durable crack-resistant front crystal. This is also the first Apple Watch to have an IP6X certification for dust resistance in addition to its WR50 water resistance rating.



The ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ is available in aluminum, stainless steel, and titanium, with pricing that starts at $399. Apple is also offering Nike and Hermes models.



‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ models did not launch alongside the iPhone 13 models because of production issues that may result in supply constraints. For that reason, customers hoping for an ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ on launch day should make sure to order early.



Customers who pre-order one of the new Apple Watch models can expect to start receiving their devices on Friday, October 15, the official launch date for the Series 7.

Widespread power outages in China are reigniting a push by tech manufacturers to shift production away from Asia's biggest economy, with suppliers to Apple, Amazon and others scrambling to keep production on track ahead of the busy holiday season.



At a midsize electronics accessories maker in Zhongshan, Guangdong Province, power outages have become the new normal.
One source who spoke to Nikkei said power outages had been sporadic since mid-September, but that now they get notice every week telling them which days the following week that power will be cut. Apple suppliers have …]]></summary>

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *It’s the last game of the preseason tonight and precisely one week until the real season starts! Don’t know about you guys but it’s very exciting!! Anyhoo, Rasmus Ristolainen has not been good. Pretty much ever. But that doesn’t mean he can’t be good now! [Inquirer]
*Big news yesterday was the Flyers announcing their two new inductees into the franchise Hall of Fame. [BSH]
*All of the candidates were clearly deserving of a spot, but it’s hard to argue against their two selections. [Flyers]
*If you had to pick one Flyer to be traded this season, who’d you go with? [The Athletic]
*Teams USA and Canada have already started to name players for their respective Olympic National Teams, which is wild. [ProHockeyTalk]
*Speaking of Canada, the teams up there are looking forward to being able to play teams down here again. [ProHockeyTalk]
*Carey Price has voluntarily entered the league’s player assistance program; here’s hoping he’s able to conquer whatever he’s fighting right now. [Habs Eyes On The Prize]
*Robin Lehner’s recent comments have put the spotlight on the NHL’s reliance on medication, name sleep aids. Why? Because sleeping is a big problem for these guys. [Sportsnet]
*What if instead of New Year’s resolutions we made New Season’s resolutions? Like, for example: “be kinder to each other” or “settle down it’s just sports.” [The Athletic]
*And finally, this week’s brand new Flyperbole takes on the goal song controversy. Which you know will be hilarious. [BSH]]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Google executive is extending an open hand to help Apple adopt RCS, a new communication protocol called Rich Communication Services to iPhone and iPad, that would replace standard SMS and offer improved cross-platform messaging capabilities.





In a tweet, Hiroshi Lockheimer, Google's senior vice president of Android, said that "group chats don't need to break this way," referring to a sub-tweet about the inconvenience Android and ‌iPhone‌ users have in communicating via messages. Alluding to the RCS protocol, Lockheimer goes on to state there is a "Really Clear Solution" and that he is offering an "open invitation to the folks who can make this right," with the "folks" in question being a reference to Apple.



Google has been rolling out RCS for the past several years, and in July, all three major carriers in the U.S. pledged to adopt RCS, which, compared to SMS, offers support for higher quality photos and videos, audio messages, improved security, and better group chats. 



With RCS, Android to Android messaging communication will become fully end-to-end encrypted. In contrast, Android to ‌iPhone‌ communication often referred to as the "green bubble," will be less secure due to Apple's unwillingness to adopt RCS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paddle:
The Epic Games v. Apple verdict clears the way for app creators to
choose an alternative to Apple’s payment system (and its 15-30%
fee!). But choose the wrong provider and you’ll be burdened with
managing payment and subscription logic, taxes, fraud, and buyer
support.
Paddle In-App Purchase will let app creators replace Apple’s
In-App Purchase without worrying about any of that.
Paddle is charging a 10 percent commission for transactions under $10, and 5 percent plus $0.50 per transaction at or above $10.
It’s unclear to me exactly how Paddle’s SDK works. They’re calling it “in-app purchase”, but it sounds like it redirects to Paddle’s website in Safari (or whatever your default browser on iOS is). If it redirects to a website, I think it might be allowed; if they’re processing transactions in-app, it’s not going to be allowed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jeff Johnson:
For the past several days at least, Google search results have not
included AMP links on iOS 15, but they still include AMP links on
iOS 14. I’ve determined that Safari’s User-Agent makes the
difference. (You can spoof the User-Agent on iOS using the
Safari web inspector on macOS.) […]
Important Update: I’ve received a statement from Danny
Sullivan, Google’s public search liaison: “It’s a bug specific to
iOS 15 that we’re working on. We expect it will be resolved soon.”
What a weird bug. It’s made weirder by the (I think) coincidence that there a bunch of popular new extensions for Safari that redirect AMP links to regular non-AMP web pages. I’ve used all three of these extensions, and they’re all great:
StopTheMadness — Johnson’s own $8 extension, that offers a whole bunch of functionality to block shitty website behavior.


Amplosion — $3 extension from Apollo developer Christian Selig. Wins for best icon for sure.


Overamped — $2 extension from Joseph Duffy. Simple and focused.



From the DF archive, January 2017: “The Problem With AMP”.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The 10 year anniversary of Steve Jobs death took place earlier this week, sparking tech leaders to share their stories of Apple's former CEO.





Dell CEO Michael Dell spoke to CNET, reminiscing about the time that Steve Jobs aimed to get Dell to license Mac OS to run on Intel-based PCs and how that might have changed the PC industry.



As the story goes, Jobs first approached Dell about a partnership after being ousted from Apple and establishing NeXT. Jobs wanted Dell to use the NeXT operating system on Dell PCs, and he claimed that it was better than Windows.



Dell told Jobs that it wasn't going to happen because there were no applications for it and "zero customer interest."



After Jobs rejoined Apple, he once again attempted a software licensing deal, trying to…]]></summary>

After over a decade, Halo may finally be back
 Despite the hype, Halo Infinite’s first two multiplayer test weekends didn’t grab me. I was initially impressed by its “classic” Halo feel. But despite its pre-release state reminding me of the glory days of Halo 3, I got bored after just a few matches, and began to wonder if a classic arena shooter is even something I want in my life in 2021. 
But I held out hope for my favorite Halo mode, Big Team Battle, to eventually punch my ticket for the Halo Infinite hype train. And after a weekend of playtime in Infinite’s largest maps, with more teammates and power weapons, I now find myself comfortably sitting in coach, actively awaiting that Dec. 8 release date. While it’s still not finished, Halo Infi…]]></summary>

The focus returns to Steph’s story
 Life is Strange: True Colors centers on Alex Chen and her once-estranged brother Gabe, but Life is Strange: Wavelengths, the DLC released in October, refocuses the story to True Colors’ important side character, Steph Gingrich. People who played Life is Strange: Before the Storm know her fairly well, as will anyone who pursued a romance with her in True Colors.
Almost more of an epilogue to Before the Storm than a prologue to True Colors, Wavelengths is the best of Life is Strange, fleshing out the vaguely supernatural world with a character grounded in reality. Wavelengths is a much smaller experience than True Colors, set entirely inside the Haven Springs record store Alex comes to know and love. It’s an intimate l…]]></summary>

 Earlier Thursday, EA Sports’ top executive said the company is reconsidering its naming-rights agreement with FIFA and could rebrand its top-selling soccer series. A couple of new trademark applications in Europe could point to a name the publisher has in mind.
EA Sports FC is the name filed just last week with the United Kingdom’s Intellectual Property Office and the European Union Intellectual Property Office. In both cases, the brand is for computer game software and online computer game entertainment. The United States Patent and Trademark Office does not have any filing or registration by that mark.

The Dutch antitrust watchdog has been investigating Apple since 2019, and while the probe started out as a look into whether Apple's App Store practices are an abuse of dominant market position, it was scaled back to focus on dating apps.

Aimed at professionals, the ProRes codec offers higher color fidelity and less compression, and it is often used for commercials, feature films, and TV broadcasts, which is testament to the high quality results that it can achieve.



A one-minute 10-bit HDR ProRes video takes up 1.7GB in HD mode. For that reason, recording ProRes video at 4K at 30 frames per second requires 256, 512, or 1TB of ‌iPhone‌ storage capacity.

The Destiny Content Vault strikes again!
 Destiny 2’s best campaign is going the way of Cayde-6. Yes, the Forsaken campaign, alongside The Tangled Shore destination, are going into the Destiny Content Vault on Feb. 22, 2022, during the launch of The Witch Queen expansion.
For the uninitiated, the Destiny Content Vault is Bungie’s way of purging old content from Destiny 2 and re-adding original Destiny content back into the game. Last year, Bungie vaulted four locations — Io, Titan, Mercury, and Mars — and returned the Cosmodrome and several associated Strikes from the original Destiny. Destiny’s first raid also returned from the Destiny Content Vault earlier this year in a reprised format.

Oh hey there, security robot! Oh wait. OH NO
 Teardown is a terrifically fun voxel destruction game that puts the player in the shoes of a sneaky saboteur pulling off the perfect heist. The game was first showcased in 2019, and is now in early access on Steam. A significant update is on the way from developer Tuxedo Labs, and it’s big enough to constitute the “second half of the game,” although there is no release date as of yet.
What’s on the way? Some additions seem small, although they’ll likely have a big impact. The wire tool, for instance, can tether objects together — and it maintain tension, so players can get some catapult action going with the right set-up.

You answered emails while stirring something on the stove. You answered different emails while half-listening to a story from a family member or roommate.

She’s 23 years-old, was raised by humans, and developed a reputation for murdering potential mates. But Walnut eventually found a good match in bird keeper Chris Crowe, a 42 year-old human who she has bonded with. Crowe, as part of his duties at the zoo, has embraced his role as Walnut’s mate in order to inseminate her with semen from a male crane.
That summer, however, Crowe noticed that Walnut seemed interested in, well, him. When Crowe stopped by her yard, she would bow her head and raise her wings — motions that Crowe now recognizes as the first moves of a mating dance. “At first, I thought that she was just excited to see me,” Crowe says. “But then I’d see the other pairs doing the same things…]]></summary>

Top executive says the company could end a licensing partnership going back to 1993
 FIFA, whose name has become synonymous with video game soccer over the past two decades, may no longer headline EA Sports’ globally dominant franchise.
Cam Weber, EA Sports’ general manager and top executive, said Thursday in a note to players that the label is “exploring the idea of renaming our global EA Sports football games. This means we’re reviewing our naming rights agreement with FIFA, which is separate from all our other official partnerships and licenses across the football world.”

        <updated>2021-10-07T10:46:10.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The iPhone 14 won't rely entirely on a hole-punch cutout to house the TrueDepth camera system, possibly meaning Apple may retain the notch alongside a hole-punch design, according to a new rumor from Weibo.





Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has reported that for at least the high-end 2022 iPhone models, Apple will use a hole-punch design, similar to those of some flagship Android smartphones. Following Kuo's report, Apple leaker Jon Prosser shared renders of what he claims to be the design of the ‌iPhone 14‌. 



Even if the ‌iPhone 14‌ introduces a hole-punch design, it will be hard for Apple to abandon the notch altogether, according to a now-deleted post on Weibo from @PandaIsBald. The account, which accurately predicted that the ninth-generation iPad would be announced at the September Apple event, claimed that it is "unlikely" that Apple will replace the notch entirely with a hole-punch cutout, and instead, the ‌iPhone 14‌ may continue to feature a notch but with a smaller footprint. 



With the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro, Apple did make the notch smaller in width but slightly taller. Apple did this by shrinking the component sizes of the TrueDepth camera system and reengineering the internals. Apple this year also moved the earpiece to the top of the bezel, freeing up space in the notch. 



Reporting on a hole-punch design for next year, Apple analyst ‌Ming-Chi Kuo‌ did not provide details on how Apple will house Face ID on the high-end ‌iPhone 14‌ models if it uses a hole-punch design. 



Today's rumor from Weibo claims that Touch ID will not be making an appearance under the display next year, meaning Face ID may continue to be the only biometric authentication option available to ‌iPhone 14‌ users.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple has started making a scaled down "Apple TV+" app available on select 2016 and 2017 LG smart TVs. The app is appearing on LG's content store in several regions including Germany, Poland, and the Nordic countries, and its existence is confirmed in an LG support document.




Image credit: Bartłomiej Wiśniowski


First spotted by FlatpanelsHD, the app interface looks very similar to the standard Apple TV app, but it only allows owners of the older webOS-based TVs to watch TV+ content. The iTunes Store and Watch Now tabs have been removed from the top navigation menu, leaving just three options there: ‌Apple TV+‌, Search, and Settings.



The fully fledged ‌Apple TV‌ app, which is available on select Samsung, LG, and Vizio TVs, allows users to stream TV shows and movies from ‌Apple TV+‌, access à-la-carte ‌Apple TV‌ Channels and their iTunes libraries, as well as buy or rent more than 100,000 shows and movies from the iTunes Store. The same services can also be accessed on select Roku and Amazon Fire TV devices.

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *We knew the cuts were coming down the pike today, but not sure any of us expected that Morgan Frost would be cut from the team before the last preseason game was even played. Certainly an interesting decision, if nothing else. [BSH]
*Here’s the thing: Frost is definitely going to play for the Flyers this season. Probably early on. For whatever reason, the coaching staff wants him to get some reps up in Allentown. There’s no reason at all to worry. Probably. [BSH]
*Charlie gets even deeper into why this move shouldn’t be taken to mean more than it does. [The Athletic]
*It was a surprise though! No getting around that. Mostly because while Frost didn’t light the world on fire he certainly wasn’t bad. And he certainly wasn’t less effective than Jackson Cates. [NBC Sports Philly]
*The Flyers, who very clearly picked the new goal song months ago and decided to make a fun “fan vote” charade of the whole thing, have narrowed it down to three choices. [Flyers]
*THEY ARE ALL BAD. [BSH]
*Anyway let’s turn the focus to something good, shall we? Namely, Joel Farabee. Who is very good. And is planning to be better. [Inquirer]
*And finally, back to the bad, Friedman’s latest Thoughts shed some light on what went wrong for the Flyers last season in the wake of Lehner’s comments about AV. Spoiler alert: literally everything. [Sportsnet]]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple's newsroom and leadership pages are both currently experiencing some errors, leading to the appearance of some changes to Apple's leadership.





From our knowledge, Apple's leadership and newsroom pages have been throwing up errors for the past two hours or so, and it seems to be that Apple is making server-side changes. In an oddity of those changes, Apple mistakenly listed Phil Schiller as Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, a role he stepped down from in August of last year to become an Apple Fellow. Apple moments later took down Schiller's biography and the entirety of the leadership page. 




Apple's website accidentally reinstated Phil Schiler as SVP of marketing


Apple's newsroom is where the company issues press releases, updates, and more, while the leadership page lists all of Apple's executives. No other pages on Apple's website currently seem to be impacted, and it remains unclear whether this is simply an error or telling of something more coming soon. We'll update this post when there are any changes.



Update: Moments after we published this article, Apple's newsroom and leadership pages were reverted back to their normal states, correctly listing Greg Joswiak as the SVP of marketing and ‌Phil Schiller‌ as an Apple Fellow.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To commemorate the 10th anniversary of Steve Jobs passing away on Tuesday, Apple shared a short film called "Celebrating Steve" on its website, and Apple has now made the video available on YouTube for those who may have missed it.






Apple describes the short film as a tribute to Steve Jobs and a celebration of his life and his extraordinary vision. The video includes many photos and short clips of Steve Jobs from throughout his life, ranging from his early days at Apple with fellow co-founder Steve Wozniak in the 1970s to introducing the original iPhone in 2007.



"Steve believed that 'people with passion can change the world for the better,'" said Apple in the video's description. "He challenged us to see the world not for what it was, but for what it could be. And he helped so many of us see the same potential in ourselves."



Steve Jobs passed away October 5, 2011 at the age of 56. Apple's CEO Tim Cook and former design chief Jony Ive are among those who have reflected on his life.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A bug in iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 is preventing Safari from loading AMP links for Google search results, but the issue is not intentional and Google is preparing a fix that's set to be released in the near future.





Developer Jeff Johnson today published a blog post speculating on whether Google had intentionally disabled AMP links for Google search results in Safari on devices running ‌iOS 15‌ (via MacStories) after he noticed their disappearance. 



As he noted, Safari's Google search results do not include AMP links on devices running ‌iOS 15‌, but AMP content still loads in iOS 14 and in other browsers like Chrome for iOS. Johnson wondered whether Google had decided to disable AMP in ‌iOS 15‌ due to the prevalence of Safari extensions that feature AMP-blocking features.




It's a bug specific to iOS 15 that we're working on. We expect it will be resolved soon.
— Danny Sullivan (@dannysullivan) October 6, 2021
 


That Google search results do not include AMP links in the Safari browser on ‌iOS 15‌ is a bug, according to Google's public search liaison Danny Sullivan. In a tweet, Sullivan said that Google is working on a fix and that the issue should be resolved soon.



For those unfamiliar with AMP, it stands for "Accelerated Mobile Pages" and it is a feature that's designed to make webpages load faster on mobile devices. AMP pages are cached, allowing them to be presented to users more quickly, but it's something that is not always popular with users because some website features are disabled when AMP is used.



When Google does re-implement AMP links, iOS 15 Safari extensions like Amplosion are available to redirect AMP links to standard webpages.

However, Valve went slightly against the grain on Wednesday when it published a video teardown of the Steam Deck on YouTube. The video presented a perfect how-to guide for modding your Steam Deck hardware, after it launches in December. It also gave Valve the opportunity to send this PSA: Don’t modify the console, because you’ll likely ruin it. 
In the video, a Valve representative gives detailed step-by-step instructions for replacing the thumbsticks and the solid-state hard drive. The footage helps clarify what will and won’t be possible with the console once it launches at the end of the year. Because Valve’s ne…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A pair of 1300-year-old skis has been discovered in an ice field in Norway. They are believed to be the best-preserved ancient skis ever found — even the bindings are mostly intact. The first of the pair was found back in 2014 and its mate was recently retrieved, an expedition you can witness in the video above.
It has been seven years since the discovery of the first ski at the Digervarden ice patch. We have patiently monitored the melt of the ice patch, in case the second ski of the pair should melt out. We were back in 2016 for a general survey of the ice patch, but the ice had not retreated much then. This year, we could see on satellite imagery that the ice patch had retreated compared to 2014. We decided to send out an archaeologist to check it.


One of the things they were hoping to find is how the skier was able to maintain forward motion with the skis, especially uphill. Modern cross-country skis rely on a texture (or wax) on the bottom of the ski to grip the snow while downhill skiers can apply skins to their skis to climb uphill. More than a thousand years ago, the choice was texture or animal fur:
One of the questions raised by the ski found in 2014 was if it originally had fur on the underside. This has major implications for the use of the ski. There were no nail holes along the sides of the 2014 ski which would have been a clear sign of the fastening of the fur. However, fur can also be glued to the underside, so we could not rule it out.
A furrow on the underside along the length of the ski, as you find on other prehistoric skis (and on modern cross-country skis), would solve the question. Such a furrow would have no function with an underside covered by fur. The 2014 ski did not show a furrow, but the new and better preserved ski does! So, probably no fur-lining.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today released the third beta of iOS 15.1 to developers for testing purposes, and the update introduces some new camera features for iPhone 13 Pro users.





ProRes Video


Today's beta adds support for ProRes video capture with the standard iPhone camera app. It can be toggled on by opening up the Settings app and selecting the "Camera" section. From there, tap on "Formats" and toggle on "Apple ProRes."





ProRes capture is limited to 30fps at 1080p on devices with only 128GB of storage, but higher capacity devices can record in 4K. Apple says that a 10-bit HDR ProRes video takes up 1.7GB in HD mode.



Macro Toggle


To take macro shots, the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ models swap over to the Ultra Wide lens when the ‌iPhone‌'s camera gets close to an object, which some people do not like because it can be difficult to get a shot with the camera constantly swapping back and forth.





iOS 15.1 beta 3 adds a toggle to turn off Auto Macro, which will prevent the Camera app from automatically switching to the Ultra Wide camera for macro photos and videos.



The feature can be enabled in the Camera section of the Settings app by scrolling down and toggling off the "Auto Macro" option.



Other Features

If you were hoping the Flyers would have an improved goal song this season, things aren’t looking too great!
 After two miserable seasons of “Feel the Shake” by Jetboy being the Flyers’ goal song, the team is mercifully (?) moving on to something different for the 2021-22 season.
Unfortunately, a new goal song doesn’t necessarily mean it’ll be a better goal song.
Last month, the Flyers announced they were turning to the fans in an effort to find a new goal song, and they tested some of the top fan-submitted requests throughout the preseason. Among the tested goal songs were “Here Comes the Hotstepper” by Ini Kamoze, “Call on Me” by Eric Prydz and, Broad Street Hockey’s personal favorite, “Whoomp! (There It Is)” by Tag Team.

New action RPG will still have that oil paint look
 PlatinumGames is changing the look of its action-RPG for Square Enix, Babylon’s Fall, which was something of an acquired taste when it was re-revealed earlier this year. While Platinum is intentionally going for “oil painting style” graphics with Babylon’s Fall, some found the aesthetic to be too muddy and stylized. So Platinum’s changing that.
On Wednesday, PlatinumGames and Square Enix showed off the revised graphics for Babylon’s Fall, which, while certainly clearer, still maintain the studio’s “brushwork style” that’s based on classical European oil paintings. You can see the revised graphical style in the slider image below, with the new graphics shown on the right.


On Babylon’s Fall’s official website, the developers revealed the new graphics in an update from the game’s closed beta test. Regarding the graphics, the developers said, “This was an area we received many strong opinions and requests about in Phases 1 and 2 of the Closed Beta Test, particularly regarding poor visibility. Accordingly, we have been working to improve the overall visual clarity, while still keeping the distinctive classic fantasy oil painting aesthetic.”
So, yeah, things are far less blurry in the latest version of Babylon’s Fall — which does not have a release date.
Square Enix and PlatinumGames announced Babylon’s Fall way back in 2018. After a period of concerning quiet, the game reemerged this summer, with Platinum confirming that the project would be a live-service multiplayer game. Babylon’s Fall is bound for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC.]]></summary>

For those unfamiliar with AKKO, it's a company that offers an AppleCare-like set of protection plans for your devices. There's smartphone-only coverage that's priced between $5 and $12 per month with full insurance that's on par with Apple's, but what really sets AKKO apart is its "Everything Protected" Plan.



With the "Everything Protected" Plan, users get coverage for one smartphone and all of their other electronic devices, up to 25 items in total. So for one $15 per month fee, AKKO offers protection for a whole wide range of devices, both new and used.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the third beta of an upcoming watchOS 8.1 beta to developers for testing purposes, with the update coming one week after the release of the second beta and two weeks after the release of the watchOS 8 update.





To install ‌‌‌watchOS 8.1‌‌‌, developers will need to download the configuration profile from the Apple Developer Center. Once installed, ‌‌‌watchOS 8‌‌‌ can be downloaded through the dedicated Apple Watch app on the iPhone by going to General > Software update.



To update to new software, an Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery life, it must be placed on the charger, and it needs to be in range of the ‌‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌‌.



We don't yet know what's new in ‌watchOS 8‌ and there were no new features found in the first two betas, but we'll update this article should anything new pop up in the third beta.

Developers can download the new tvOS 15 beta by downloading a profile onto the ‌Apple TV‌ using Xcode.



Other than new releases, tvOS updates are often minor in scale, focusing on under-the-hood bug fixes and improvements rather than major outward-facing changes. We don't yet know what's included in tvOS 15.1, but this beta fixes a bug with VoiceOver, according to Apple's release notes. 



Though we don't often know what's new in tvOS during the beta testing process, we let MacRumors readers know when new updates are available so those who are developers can download it upon release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even for mathematically minded folks, statistics can be hard to grasp. Take statistical paradoxes for example: Simpson’s Paradox is a real mind-boggler. Ryan Anderson explains this paradox in a recent issue of Why is this interesting?
It’s simple to describe, yet it still stops me in my tracks when I see it in the wild. The paradox is that a measurable effect on a large population disappears, or even reverses when that population is split into subgroups. The cause of these results is almost always a material change in the denominators from one period to the next.
Showing is easier than telling with paradoxes, so here is a classic example: In 1995 and 1996, David Justice had a higher batting average than Derek Jeter in each year. However, Jeter had a higher cumulative batting average over those two years.


It’s true; look:

Anderson continues:
How does this work? Jeter’s 1996 stats accounted for over 92% of his total performance over the two years, as he was 20 years old and only called up to the major league for a few games in 1995. Meanwhile, Justice’s 1996 stats were only 25% of his total performance due to a separated shoulder he suffered barely two months into the season. So while Justice performed better on smaller sample size, Jeter’s 183 hits in 1996 were the strongest signal for overall performance.


Read the rest of the piece; he goes on to connect statistical paradoxes to efforts to mislead people about the pandemic and vaccine effectiveness.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[iPhone 13 Pro models feature an upgraded Ultra Wide camera with autofocus that enables macro photography, allowing users to take close-up photos of flowers, insects, and other objects that are as close as 2cm to the camera lens.





Apple's Macro Mode is limited to iPhone 13 Pro models, but those with older iPhones can now get in on the action, as Halide today announced that it has updated its popular third-party camera app with its own Macro Mode, with no accessories required. The feature is available on all iPhones with a Neural Engine, including the iPhone 8 and newer.



Halide said its Macro Mode first checks which one of your iPhone's camera lenses can focus the closest and switches to it. Then, the feature provides ultra-precise focus control down to the sub-millimeter to ensure the photo looks sharp. Finally, an AI-based feature called Neural Macro further enhances close-up details of the photo once shot.




Halide's sample photo shot with its Macro Mode on iPhone 12 Pro


If you already have an iPhone 13 Pro model, Halide said its Macro Mode essentially stacks on top of Apple's Macro Mode, resulting in "staggeringly close, microscope-like shots that are even more highly magnified."



To turn on Macro Mode in the Halide app, first tap the AF button to get into manual focus, and then tap the flower button. The feature is available as a free update for all existing users, with version 2.5 of the app rolling out on the App Store today. For new users, the Halide app is priced at $2.99 per month or $11.99 per year, or $49.99 as a one-time purchase.

Grounded’s Hot and Hazy update arrives on Oct. 20
 Grounded, the backyard survival game from Obsidian Entertainment, is getting a big update on Oct. 20. The free download will add several new areas for players to explore, including a sandbox and a pile of trash. It will debut simultaneously for both the PC and Xbox versions of the game.
Launched in July 2020, Grounded is a departure for Obsidian, which is best known for role-playing games like Outer Worlds, Pillars of Eternity, and Fallout: New Vegas. In it, players take on the role of shrunken children and are tasked with exploring their own backyard. Enemies include rodents, pests, and other stereotypical suburban nightmares.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today reminded developers that App Store apps that allow for account creation must also allow users to initiate deletion of their account from within the app starting early next year. The requirement applies to all app submissions starting January 31, 2022.





The requirement follows updates to the App Store Review Guidelines in June. Apple encouraged developers to review any laws that may require them to maintain certain types of data, such as electronic health records, sales records, and warranty records.



As discovered earlier this week, Apple also confirmed that a revamped "Report a Problem" link has returned to App Store app pages on iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey so users can more easily report concerns with apps they've downloaded, such as scams. This feature is currently available for users in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States, and Apple says it will expand to other regions over time.



"Problematic apps diminish the App Store experience for users and developers, and we're constantly expanding techniques to identify even more types of problematic content for removal," said Apple. "If we suspect that a developer has engaged in purposeful manipulation, fraud or abuse, we will notify them and take action. Consequences may include removal of apps and may impact their Apple Developer Program membership."

Yes, I know there is no shortage of third party weather apps. Some of them are great. But the devil is always in the defaults. And that default Weather widget is about to land on tens of millions of iPad screens with the launch of iPad OS 15 this fall. And with that, Apple will be sending tens of millions of dollars (maybe more?) indirectly to weather.com — which, incidentially is now owned by IBM. Insert the Steve Jobs giving the finger image here.
Do weather.com executives hold some sort of blackmail on the iPad OS dev team within Apple? I can’t come up with a better explanation.
The whole situation is bizarre. Apple just redid the Weather app in iOS 15 to be more beautiful. And the widgets reflect that. And they throw it all in the trash compactor when it comes time to drill down on the iPad.
The lack of a built-in iPad Weather app was a little weird before, but now that they have a built-in Weather widget that, when you tap it, takes you to The Weather Channel’s janky-assed website, it’s downright bizarre.

The 22-year-old finds himself in a unique spot having fallen into a top-nine role despite having logged just two games in the last year.
 So here’s the thing about Morgan Frost through three preseason games — it’s too early to worry about Morgan Frost. 
Now that the obvious is out of the way — and we can’t stress this enough — it’s just too soon to worry about Morgan Frost, we can delve into some of what we’ve seen from the play that suggests that you should…well, you get the idea. 
For starters, the three games the 22-year-old has played in the last two weeks is more than he played all of 2020-21 — not including the lost workout time and bizarre rehabilitation schedule as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. And we’re not even talking about a play…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The European Commission is planning to charge Apple with anticompetitive behavior with regards to Apple Pay, since it is the only payment service that can use the iPhone's Near-Field Communication (NFC) chip, Reuters reports.





EU antitrust investigator Margrethe Vestager has been investigating ‌Apple Pay‌ since June last year, but the European Commission has since centered its focus on the NFC chip alone, according to individuals familiar with the matter speaking to Reuters.



The NFC chip in the ‌iPhone‌ and Apple Watch enables tap-and-go contactless payments, but ‌Apple Pay‌ is the only payment service that can use this hardware. On Android devices, multiple payment services can offer contactless payments using the NFC chip, but on the ‌iPhone‌, no rival services are allowed to leverage the NFC hardware.



The Commission's preliminary concerns also reportedly include Apple's terms and conditions on how ‌Apple Pay‌ should be used in merchants' apps and on websites. Concerns may have been raised by ‌Apple Pay‌'s wide reach and better user experience on the ‌iPhone‌ compared to other services, and accelerated by the growth of contactless payments during the global health crisis.



The EU competition enforcer is now believed to be preparing a statement of objections to charge Apple with anticompetitive conduct, which is expected to be sent to the company next year. The antitrust charge could put Apple at risk of a large fine and force it to open the NFC chip to rival payment systems in Europe. Similar investigations have also been opened in Australia.

Some observations for your morning…
 Well gang, the Flyers played their second game of the back to back last night with very much their B squad, against a more loaded Islanders team, in their AHL arena, in a game you could only watch on a sort of lackluster stream on their website and socials. It went about as well as you might have expected. The Flyers showed a bit of flash but the mismatch got them in the end, and they dropped this one 3-0. It was a bit of a yawner, but we do still have some takeaways to hit on before we can finally put this one to bed.

Ubisoft’s newest open world is frozen in time
 Yara, the Cuba-inspired region in which Far Cry 6 takes place, is introduced as a “tropical paradise frozen in time.” Its people once raised arms to overthrow a dictator, but now, his son Antón Castillo (voiced by Afro-Italian actor Giancarlo Esposito) is following in his footsteps, deploying the military in every corner and disposing of anyone who isn’t what he calls a “True Yaran.” History begins to repeat itself through abusive and exploitative practices, while the country burns and progress is measured in blood. And like its island setting, Far Cry 6 feels like history repeating itself — a perfect showcase for how Far Cry as a whole is frozen in time.

A poster on Reddit brought attention to a discoloration and distortion issue that they were having when touching the screen with the iPad in portrait orientation.

I got my 64gb Wi-Fi iPad Mini 6 just about a week ago and noticed that there seems to be an LCD clearance issue – if you put your mini in vertical orientation (with the power button on the top right) push very lightly on the screen and you will see distortion and discoloration about an inch down and in from the top right. On most models this will happen in three spots along the top of the display (when vertical).

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *There was a games yesterday, but no one could watch it. Did it really happen? Schrodinger's Hockey Game. The Flyers lost, so yeah let’s just pretend it never happened. RECAP! 
*We DID get to watch the one before that, though. And the Flyers won, and we learned some stuff. [BSH]
*Judging by Alain Vigneault’s comments yesterday, today is the day the final roster starts to get finalized. Exciting! 
Alain Vigneault said before tonight's preseason game that by Thursday's practice, they'll be down to 22-24 players on their camp roster, in anticipation of the final preseason game on Friday. So basically their final roster.
— Charlie O'Connor (@charlieo_conn) October 5, 2021



*To that end, the Flyers made some not-all-too-surprising cuts yesterday. [BSH]
*Meltzer has some thoughts on the latest at training camp. [Flyers]
*The roster isn’t the only thing that needs figuring out, though. The preseason games are a great place to try and figure out how to make your special teams actually work. [Inquirer]
*Charlie gave us 10 Things from that Boston game the other night, always good stuff. [The Athletic]
*Charlie mentions it in his article but it bears calling out: Robin Lehner has walked back his comments on AV, claiming he never meant to suggest the Flyers or Vigneault were involved in this whole medications accusation. Lehner is now involved in talks with the league to try and get some resolution. [ESPN]
*And finally, the full season predictions and models are dropping, and DGB’s got some ideas about how all 32 teams will shake out. [The Athletic]]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Safari 15 has faced a barrage of complaints about its controversial new design, and while Apple has listened to user feedback and reversed some changes or made them optional, many users still struggle to discern an active tab from a background tab on the Mac browser because of the inverted shading.





Unfortunately for users who do not like the new design, Apple has not made any changes to the shading of tabs in either the Safari 15.1 beta or the latest version of the experimental Safari Technology Preview browser. 



Fortunately however, developer Zhenyi Tan was inspired by John Gruber's Daring Fireball article about the issue and has since come up with a simple Safari extension called ActiveTab that provides a solution.



ActiveTab simply makes it easier to spot the active tab in Safari on Mac by drawing a line underneath it. There are eight colors to choose from, and the line below the tab can be customized to be between 1 and 7 pixels wide. 





As Zhenyi notes, the extension works best with the "Separate" tab layout selected and "Show color in tab bar" disabled in the Tab section of Safari's Preferences. Zhenyi also cautions that ActiveTab will not work reliably if you have so many tabs in a window that the tab bar becomes scrollable.



ActiveTab is available for $1.99 on the Mac App Store, with no in-app purchases, no ads, and no tracking.

That was painful to watch, but at least it’s over.
 Before the recap something has to be said. How does NEW YORK, a city with how many local sports networks, not carry this game on TV? It’s 2021, folks, what are we doing here?
First Period
Well, it wasn’t the best of beginnings for the Phan — I mean the Flyers, as Nicolas Aube-Kubel took an early penalty leading almost immediately to a Anthony Beauvillier goal. Penalties really seemed to kill NAK last season, and have always been an issue for the tenacious winger. 
Philadelphia would get a power play of their own just minutes later, but alas would do nothing with it. Linus Sandin made a nice move in close, but newcomer to Long Island Cory Schneider was up to the task.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back on launch day for the iPhone 13 last month, a number of Apple Card users had difficulties placing orders for their devices, with many of those users ultimately resorting to different forms of payment in order to ensure their orders went through in a timely fashion.





As shared by a number of MacRumors readers, Apple today sent out emails to affected customers, letting them know that they will be credited with the 3% Daily Cash they would have earned on their ‌iPhone 13‌ purchases even though they were unable to complete their purchases with their Apple Cards.
You successfully completed your iPhone pre-order with a payment method other than Apple Card. We understand that your initial purchase attempt with Apple Card was declined and you didn’t earn 3% Daily Cash. 



We apologize for the inconvenience you experienced and want to make it up to you. We are providing you a credit for the Daily Cash on the initial payment of your iPhone 13. You’ll see this appear as a Balance Adjustment in the Wallet app. This will also appear on your October monthly statement. 



If you would like to continue earning Daily Cash back on future iPhone payments with your Apple Card, please visit citizensoneloan.com to update your payment method.



If you have any questions, contact an Apple Card Specialist.
The 3% Daily Cash credits are already going through, with users able to check the Wallet app to confirm their credit has been received.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Using data from Johns Hopkins, this time lapse video shows the spread of Covid-19 across the US from Feb 2020 to Sept 2021. This looks so much like small fires exploding into raging infernos and then dying down before flaring up all over again. Indeed, forest fire metaphors seem to be particularly useful in describing pandemics like this.
Think of COVID-19 as a fire burning in a forest. All of us are trees. The R0 is the wind speed. The higher it is, the faster the fire tears through the forest. But just like a forest fire, COVID-19 needs fuel to keep going. We’re the fuel.
In other forest fire metaphorical scenarios, people are ‘kindling’, ‘sparks being thrown off’ (when infecting others) and ‘fuel’ (when becoming infected). In these cases, fire metaphors convey the dangers posed by people being in close proximity to one another, but without directly attributing blame: people are described as inanimate entities (trees, kindling, fuel) that are consumed by the fire they contribute to spread.

With the update, ‌AirPods Pro‌ and ‌AirPods Max‌ are able to take advantage of the ‌Find My‌ network, allowing them to be located through connections with the Apple devices owned by other people.



Prior to now, ‌AirPods Pro‌ and ‌AirPods Max‌ were listed in the ‌Find My‌ app, but if they were out of Bluetooth range, they would only display last known location. Through the update, the ‌Find My‌ network will provide an approximate location for the AirPods to help you get within Bluetooth range to track down your headphones using the Play a Sound feature.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is Samson and Delilah, a painting attributed to the Flemish master Peter Paul Rubens that hangs in the National Gallery in Britain.

Since the late 90s, there’s been some doubt cast upon the painting’s authorship, summarized in this short video:

From a recent piece in the Guardian about an AI art-analysis algorithm that declared Samson and Delilah is not a Rubens painting:
Critics have long argued that it is only a copy of a Rubens original that is known to have been painted between 1608 and 1609 for his Antwerp patron Nicolaas Rockox which then disappeared after his death in 1640.
They argue that the National Gallery picture is a different painting, one that only surfaced in 1929, declared a Rubens by Ludwig Burchard, an expert who, after his death in 1960, was found to have misattributed paintings by giving out certificates of authenticity for commercial gain.
The picture’s critics dismiss its colours as uncharacteristic of Rubens’s palette and its composition as awkward. They question why, for example, it differs from two contemporary copies made from Rubens’s original. The toes of Samson’s outstretched right foot, for example, are cropped in the National Gallery version, while they are shown in an engraving by Jacob Matham and a painting that depicts the Samson and Delilah hanging in Rockox’s home by Frans Francken the Younger.

Crafting is serious business
 New World offers a lush island for players to explore, and nearly everything you can encounter can be chopped down, picked up, or skinned to create materials for some kind of crafting. One of the most humble (and calming) professions is fishing. But New World’s most dedicated players aren’t fishing for fun — they’re trying to get sick buffs for their big PvP battles.
In a post on the game’s Reddit page, a user called BlakeGarrison62 explains that certain legendary fish can be crafted into a foodstuff that increases a certain stat by 40. The buff lasts 30 minutes, which is enough to turn the tide in a major battle. Certain classes, like fire mages, would see a massive increase in their damage.

Off to the Phantoms with you. 
 At long last, the first proper round of cuts is here! With the somewhat frenetic schedule the Flyers have been dealing with to start the preseason, they’ve needed a few more bodies around to keep anybody from getting too worn down, so this has been a long time coming. It isn’t a massive trimming of the roster, but it’s something!
The Flyers have assigned the following players to the Lehigh Valley Phantoms:
Samuel Ersson
Logan Day
Samu Tuomaala
Mason Millman
Maksim Sushko
Wyatte Wylie
Max Willman
Matthew Strome
In addition, they have also returned Elliot Desnoyers to Halifax of the QMJHL. 
And there’s not too much that’s surprising here. All of these players were pretty well outside of the mix for a spot with the Flyers righ…]]></summary>

A new look for the Doctor, plus muskets!
 Dread Hunger is an excellent social sabotage game that is currently in open access. Players take the role of a doomed expeditioner in 1847. Dark thralls from beneath the ice have taken over a small number of the crew with the intent of sabotaging the expedition and causing a whole lot of trouble for everybody. The game is moving along nicely, and is now set for a full release on Steam on Nov. 10.
While waiting for future updates, the Dread Hunger developer has released an update called Bad Medicine. The doctor class has gotten a sharp looking update, so he looks a little more distinctive among the other folks on the ship — which is useful, considering his healing perks can save the ship from disaster.
  LAUNCH DATE ANNOUNCED

There’s also a ship armory, full of powerful muskets. The trick is that there’s an elaborate lock on the door, and it’ll take six codes gathered from around the map to crack the door open. You also want to make sure that the right person gets their hands on a musket, and not the thrall traitors, lest you find yourself in a pickle.]]></summary>

In the memo, Cook said that Jobs was a husband, a father, a friend, and a visionary who left an extraordinary legacy behind, adding that not a day goes by that he doesn't think about him. Apple's former design chief Jony Ive shared similarly heartfelt comments about Jobs this week, describing him as the most inquisitive human he has ever met.



Cook's full memo reads as follows:

The new season also adds Alex Mason as an Operator
 Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War season 6, the game’s last season, is coming coming this week. On Tuesday, Treyarch revealed what players can expect from the season 6 battle pass, including new Operators and new weapons for both Black Ops Cold War and Warzone. 
Cold War season 6’s battle pass will add a couple of new weapons to the game. The first is the new .410 Ironhide shotgun, which is available at Tier 15. The Ironhide is extremely slow, but it’s a heavy hitting weapon with a pretty long range one-shot kill — at least for a shotgun. The battle pass also adds the Grav assault rifle at Tier 31. The Grav will have a range similar to the QBZ-83 and the fastest muzzle velocity of any assault rifle in the game, along with a 35-round magazine on the base version.
The season 6 battle pass will include Alex Mason as the game’s newest Operator. The protagonist from the original Call of Duty: Black Ops has seen better days, but he’s back for the fight as the Cold War continues. The pass will also add several Operator skins including an Adler skin, the Aurora Borealis Mason skin, and more.
The new season patch will arrive on Oct. 6 at 12 a.m. ET for Black Ops Cold War and Oct. 7 at 12 a.m. ET for Call of Duty: Warzone. On Nov. 6, in the middle of season 6, Call of Duty: Vanguard is scheduled to be released, but it’s not clear if that will change anything about Warzone or season 6, or if we’ll have to wait for the start of a new season for the changes.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A number of banks are currently pressuring Visa to make changes to the way it processes some payments made via Apple Pay, moves that would reduce the fees the banks pay to Apple for certain transactions, reports The Wall Street Journal.





At the heart of the issue are automatic recurring payments like memberships and streaming services. Visa is aiming to change the way it issues tokens for ‌Apple Pay‌ cards such that Apple would only receive a transaction fee on an initial subscription payment and not on subsequent transactions.
When Apple introduced Apple Pay in 2014, the iPhone had already clobbered music players, cameras and GPS systems. Banks and card networks worried it also would displace card payments.



Banks agreed to pay Apple 0.15% of each purchase made by their credit cardholders. (They pay a separate fee on debit-card transactions.) Those fees account for most of the revenue that Apple makes from its digital wallet, according to people familiar with the matter.
Aside from the fee arrangement, Apple garnered several other concessions from credit card issuers as it rolled out ‌Apple Pay‌, and in exchange, Apple agreed not to launch its own credit card network to go up against Visa and Mastercard.



With the launch of Apple Card in partnership with Goldman Sachs, Apple has become more of a direct competitor to other banks, and some bank executives have reportedly been angered by Apple's move and are seeking ways to reduce the payments they make to Apple.



Apple has unsurprisingly informed Visa that it objects to the proposed change that would reduce the fees it receives on recurring transactions, so it remains to be seen whether Visa will follow through on its plans, which are scheduled to go into effect next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple CEO Tim Cook has previously stated that Apple's greatest contribution to mankind will be related to health, but Insider's Blake Dodge today reported that the company's health team has faced internal issues and a series of high-level departures.





The report, based on conversations with 11 current and former Apple employees and the review of dozens of documents, claims that Apple's health team has faced organizational problems that have left the group "without clear direction and struggling to mesh Apple's hardware-oriented culture with the practices of the medical business." 



Some of the employees cited in the report said colleagues faced negative treatment after raising concerns, while some employees expressed concerns about inaccurate information reaching Apple's senior leadership, including Apple's COO Jeff Williams, who oversees both the Apple Watch and the company's broader health initiatives.



In a statement, Apple said many of the assertions in the story "are based on incomplete, outdated, and inaccurate information," adding that "any and all allegations of retaliatory behavior are investigated thoroughly and handled with appropriate corrective actions."



Insider's report provides more details about specific allegations from within Apple's health team.

What would life on a flat Earth be like? Well for one thing, gravity would present some challenges. From a 2018 piece by Doug Main at the Columbia Climate School:
People who believe in a flat Earth assume that gravity would pull straight down, but there’s no evidence to suggest it would work that way. What we know about gravity suggests it would pull toward the center of the disk. That means it would only pull straight down at one point on the center of the disk. As you got increasingly far from the center, gravity would tug more and more horizontally. This would have some strange impacts, like sucking all the water toward the center of the wor…]]></summary>

Someone help me budget this
 I love games that give me stress dreams. Something about being on the precipice of dying or just getting punched in the face — I find it all very motivating, in a Marie Kondo “I love mess” sort of way. When the table stakes feel high I get to reward my lizard brain with each newly completed task. Gridlock me in an unforgiving wave of these little to-do items, and I will sit glued to the computer for hours and hours, like the time I played Frostpunk until 3 a.m.
Gas Station Simulator is a fever dream that mixes these stressful management elements with retro graphics and an arcade minigame feel. Its look and animation are pretty hideous, and the individual elements of gameplay don’t necessarily make for a fun game on their own.…]]></summary>

Some observations for your morning…
 They picked up their first win of the preseason on Saturday, and since that dam was broken, the Flyers seem to be rolling here. They faced a lineup of effectively, if we’re honest here, Providence Bruins, and while goaltender Jeremy Swayman once again gave them a lot of trouble, the Flyers put together a pretty dominant effort, kept their heads down, and picked up a win in overtime. They were without a number of what should be their regulars, but they still looked sharp all the same, and there was a lot to like in this showing. 
All stats via Natural Stat Trick.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jony Ive, in a remembrance of his friend for The Wall Street Journal (News+):
I loved how he saw the world. The way he thought was profoundly
beautiful.
He was without doubt the most inquisitive human I have ever met.
His insatiable curiosity was not limited or distracted by his
knowledge or expertise, nor was it casual or passive. It was
ferocious, energetic and restless. His curiosity was practiced
with intention and rigor.
Many of us have an innate predisposition to be curious. I believe
that after a traditional education, or working in an environment
with many people, curiosity is a decision requiring intent and
discipline.
In larger groups our conversations gravitate towards the tangible,
the measurable. It is more comfortable, far easier and more
socially acceptable talking about what is known. Being curious and
exploring tentative ideas were far more important to Steve than
being socially acceptable.
Our curiosity begs that we learn. And for Steve, wanting to learn
was far more important than wanting to be right.

Fortnite’s Halloween event is a season within a season
 It’s Halloween time in Fortnite, and that means the return of the Fortnitemares event. In a blog on Tuesday morning, Epic Games revealed that Fortnitemares, that game’s annual Halloween spectacular, is back in 2021. But this year, Epic’s creepy bash will be bigger than ever, with new content regularly throughout October.
Players can get their hands on new and unique pumpkin and trick-or-treat costumes, as well as costumes based on Halloween classics like Frankenstein’s Monster and The Mummy. New costumes will be revealed regularly in the shop. There’s a new Short Nite — a kind of mini-film festival — coming. And Fortnite Creative players will get new content as well. The island itself will include Dual Fiend Hunters and a new crossbow-like weapon.
Last year, Fortnitemares came with the subtitle, “Midas’ Revenge,” and offered a direct story tie-in, and this year’s event involves the mysterious Cube. Epic still has more information to reveal around this year’s Fortnitemares, and will update its blog with new reveals over the next few weeks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple is planning two new iPad Pro models with low-power LTPO OLED displays for release in 2023 or 2024, according to Korean website The Elec. The report claims that one of the new models will likely have a 12.9-inch display.





While the iPad Pro has featured ProMotion since 2017, the device supports a smaller range of refresh rates between 24Hz and 120Hz. Following in the footsteps of the iPhone 13 Pro, the switch to LTPO OLED display technology could pave the way for future iPad Pro models to support a wider range of refresh rates between 10Hz and 120Hz.



Refresh rates supported by 2017 and newer iPad Pro models:
120Hz


60Hz


40Hz


30Hz


24Hz
Refresh rates supported by the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max:
120Hz


80Hz


60Hz


48Hz


40Hz


30Hz


24Hz


20Hz


16Hz


15Hz


12Hz


10Hz
In an investor note with TF International Securities, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently claimed that Apple abandoned its plans to release an iPad with an OLED display in 2022, with multiple sources now agreeing on a 2023 or later timeframe.



It's worth noting that, back in July, Display Supply Chain Consultants analyst Ross Young claimed that the first iPad with an OLED display would be released in 2023. Young has proven to be a reliable source for display-related rumors, including accurately revealing that the new iPad mini would feature an 8.3-inch display.

The history and evolution of the genre
 The act of noticing something, with your eyes or hands or nose, comes naturally to humans. When you start playing a video game, it’s one of the first things you do: notice things. What buttons do I press? Which way do I go? What items can I grab? Hidden object games focus singularly on this one idea — the gameplay of searching — to create compelling environments, to tell stories, and to build out worlds.
You could argue that there are elements of hidden object games in most video games. The inherent mechanic is in reacting to things hidden in an environment, whether that’s a patterned ledge, as an environmental clue, or an object literally hidden within a space. Going even further, people have been pl…]]></summary>

Perhaps inspired by macOS, the main Windows 11 screen features rounded corners on several interface elements including application windows, and in combination with a new theming system that combines specific wallpapers with colors, the overall design looks modern, with more depth and less clutter than Windows 10, which is now six years old.



In the clearest design change, the refreshed desktop moves the Start menu and taskbar, interface elements that are familiar to all Windows users, to the center of the screen, a location not dissimilar to where the Dock lives in macOS.

*The Flyers practiced before the games yesterday but all anyone wanted to talk about, shockingly enough, was Robin Lehner’s tweets. [BSH]
*The big takeaway from AV’s comments was that he was, more than anything, disappointed by Lehner’s accusations. [ESPN]
*The big (small?) man in charge had some things to say about Lehner’s tweets as well. [Sportsnet]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today commemorated the tenth anniversary of Steve Jobs' passing with a special commemorative homepage on its website, including pictures and a link to a short film that captures some of his most memorable quotes and moments at Apple's helm.





The homepage also includes a statement from the Jobs family, reproduced below:

For a decade now, mourning and healing have gone together.

Our gratitude has become as great as our loss.



Each of us has found his or her own path to consolation,

but we have come together in a beautiful place of love

for Steve, and for what he taught us.



For all of Steve's gifts, it was his power as a teacher that has endured. He taught us to be open to the beauty of the world, to be curious around new ideas, to see around the next corner, and most of all to stay humble in our own beginner's mind.



There are many things we still see through his eyes, but he also

taught to look for ourselves. He gave us equipment for living,

and it has served us well.



One of our greatest sources of consolation has been our association of Steve with beauty. The sight of something beautiful — a wooded hillside, a well‑made object — recalls his spirit to us. Even in his years of suffering, he never lost his faith in the beauty of existence.



Memory is inadequate for what is in our hearts: we miss him profoundly. We were blessed to have him as husband and father.
Also in commemoration, Apple's former design chief Jony Ive has penned a remembrance of his friend and colleague for the Wall Street Journal Magazine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple's new iPhone 13 series features its latest A15 Bionic processor, which the company says is 50% faster than the competition. That vague claim was the entry point for AnandTech's investigation into the chip's performance, efficiency, and graphics core improvements, and the review's conclusions easily back it up. 




Compared to the competition, the A15 isn't +50 faster as Apple claims, but rather +62% faster. While Apple's larger cores are more power hungry, they're still a lot more energy efficient.
Two new CPU microarchitectures feature in the A15, both for the two performance cores and the four efficiency cores, which are likely made on a 5nm+ process, which TSMC refers to as N5P, a "performance-enhanced version" of its 5nm process that allows for higher maximum frequencies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This blog is almost 22 years old, and in all that time I’ve been solid about posting regularly — until this recent dry spell.
I skipped the summer. Last post was in June. There was just one that month, and just one in May.
I have an explanation: while my health and physical circumstances are unchanged and, happily, fine, I have not felt the drive to write here that I always felt.
I never, in all these years, had to push myself. I’d get an idea and I would be compelled to write it up and publish it. It was always that simple.
But I haven’t felt that way in many months, and I’m not sure I will again.
Maybe this is temporary, and there will be hundreds more posts to come.
But I kind of think not, because there’s a bigger issue: I expect and hope that eventually I will no longer be a public person — no blog, no Twitter, no public online presence at all.
I have no plan. I’m feeling my way to that destination, which is years off, surely, and I just hope to manage it gracefully. (I don’t know of any role models with this.)
Anyway. In case I don’t write here again — in case these are the last words of this blog — thank you. I loved writing here, and you are why.]]></summary>

A good ol’ fashioned preseason goalie duel!
 First Period
As to be expected with two defensively-minded squads, it was a pretty boring first 20 minutes of hockey in South Philly. Both goalies had minimal stressful situations, but both made saves when they needed to. Jeremy Swayman made a fantastic save on Nicolas Aube-Kubel who used a power move to beat the defender, and tried to score with a cross-body shot.
NAK was by far the most impressive Flyer of the period, and looked more like the player we saw come into his own in 2019-20. Last season wasn’t the season we expected from him, but with a normal training camp and normal preseason, it finally looks like the old NAK is back. 
Two youngsters on the blueline played well in Wyatt Wylie and Linus Hogberg. …]]></summary>

Tom Strickx and Celso Martinho, writing for the Cloudflare blog:
“Facebook can’t be down, can it?”, we thought, for a second.
Today at 1651 UTC, we opened an internal incident entitled “Facebook DNS lookup returning SERVFAIL” because we were worried that something was wrong with our DNS resolver 1.1.1.1.  But as we were about to post on our public status page we realized something else more serious was going on.
Social media quickly burst into flames, reporting what our engineers rapidly confirmed too. Facebook and its affiliated services WhatsApp and Instagram were, in fact, all down. Their DNS names stopped resolving, and their infrastructure IPs were unreachable. It was as if someone had “pulled the cables” from their data centers all at once and disconnected them from the Internet.
How’s that even possible?
DNS is deep dark stuff, and even at the pidgin level at which Daring Fireball operates, it terrifies me. Can’t even imagine how complicated it is at Facebook’s scale. What a fiasco.

And some spooky skeletons to get October started
 Indie developers continue to push the envelope with the wild and weird worlds we get to play in. A lot of the joy of this column comes from seeing what developers create, when left to their own devices — and this week it’s a third-person shooter where you’ll take on the world, fighting as a coffee bean who barrels headfirst into James Bond-level action. 
We have dangerous coffee beans and more in Cool WIP, Polygon’s weekly roundup of eye-catching clips, and screenshots of works in progress.

We want some dang goals.
 The Philadelphia Flyers march on in their preseason and tonight will be facing the Boston Bruins at home in a matchup that might mean something and might not. It’s hump day; the fourth of six warm-up games that are meaningless because we basically know who is going to be in the final lineup. Regardless, it’s something to do.
All we want to do is get together and clap our damn hands together as we mindlessly watch some dudes skate around on the ice with a puck. Can we just enjoy the Flyers scoring more goals than the other team as well?

The flaming-spear-wielding Thoma also makes his debut
 Genshin Impact’s Inazuma region continues to grow with the latest update of the game. The open-world adventure will be getting its 2.2 update, Into the Perilous Labyrinth of Fog, on Oct. 13, Mihoyo announced Monday. The addition will bring the last of the islands of Inazuma, a new playable character Thoma, and a series of new challenges and minigames to Genshin Impact. 
Also, all players regardless of the platform can now claim Aloy from Horizon Zero Dawn, as long as they’re above adventure rank 20.
This update builds on the Inazuma update, which brought a new story and giant Japanese-inspired region to the game. The 2.2 update will add Tsurumi Island, a dark and foreboding island filled with more powerful monsters.

Genshin Impact is a free-to-play adventure game where players use gacha mechanics to unlock characters. In addition to introducing a new character named Thoma, this update will bring back fan-favorites like Childe and Hu Tao under new banners and will once again give players a shot at unlocking them.
As far as non-character updates go, the update will bring a new rhythm minigame as part of the Tuned to the World’s Sounds event, as well an Inazuma-themed Realm style and Furnishing Blueprints, so you can design your home based on the architectural flourishes of the region. Also, fans will now be able to use their DualSense controllers on the PC version.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Intel today shared a new ad titled Breaking the Spell: Social Experiment. In the four-minute video, Intel invites 12 supposed Apple fans to a focus group showcasing features of "upcoming devices" that were, in fact, PCs that are already on the market. The ad was spotted earlier by French website MacGeneration.






The video starts out by saying that many Apple fans only care about Apple products, and Intel attempts to change that viewpoint. The supposed Apple fans are ushered into a room that looks similar to an Apple Store, creating the impression that they are being shown new Apple products, but the devices are actually PCs powered by Intel processors. 



According to Intel's Ryan Shrout, the ad features each participant's "real" reactions instead of scripted ones. "It's surprising to see how many people that utilize tech still don't know the capabilities of the PC," he said in a tweet.



The ad is part of Intel's #GoPC marketing campaign that it launched last year after Apple started transitioning to custom Apple Silicon chips in Macs. Intel even recruited former "I'm a Mac" actor Justin Long for some of the ads.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today informed Apple Authorized Service Providers that it will be adding the third-generation Apple TV and its AA battery charger to its vintage products list on October 31, according to a memo obtained by MacRumors.





The third-generation Apple TV was released in March 2012 and many third-party apps have already phased out support for the device. The third-generation model is also the last Apple TV that does not run tvOS, and thus lacks access to the App Store.



Introduced in July 2010, the Apple Battery Charger was priced at $29 and included six rechargeable AA batteries for use with the original Apple Wireless Keyboard, Magic Trackpad, and Magic Mouse for the Mac. Apple discontinued the charger around 2016 and the Magic accessories now have built-in batteries that can be recharged via Lightning.



In the past, vintage Apple products were no longer eligible for repairs at the Genius Bar or at Apple Authorized Service Providers, but Apple now provides service for up to seven years on vintage products, subject to parts availability.



The original Apple Watch was added to Apple's vintage products list last week.

WoW patch 3.1.0 made him ‘realize what horrors centralized services can bring’
 Maybe take this with a grain of salt, but, the creator of Ethereum — the blockchain that spawned the NFT craze — says he was driven to create decentralized money because his World of Warcraft character was cruelly nerfed.
“I happily played World of Warcraft during 2007-2010, but one day Blizzard removed the damage component from my beloved warlock’s Siphon Life spell,” Vitalik Buterin, the programmer who developed Ethereum’s original concept in late 2013, says in a bio hosted at about.me. “I cried myself to sleep, and on that day I realized what horrors centralized services can bring. I soon decided to quit.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Safari 15's controversial new design on the Mac has led to complaints about the way the browser indicates which tab is active.





As illustrated by Daring Fireball's John Gruber, there was never any ambiguity about which tab is active in previous versions of Safari, as an active tab is shown with lighter shading that matches the browser's toolbar.



In Safari 15, however, tabs have a new button-like design with a rounder and more defined appearance. Apple has also inverted its shading of tabs, with an active tab now having darker shading and inactive tabs having lighter shading. The change has annoyed Gruber and other users, as evidenced by this Reddit thread with nearly 1,000 upvotes.



"The design is counterintuitive," wrote Gruber. "What sense does it make that no matter your settings, the active tab is rendered with less contrast between the tab title and the background than background tabs? The active tab should be the one that pops."



In a Safari 15 window with two tabs open, especially from the same website, Gruber said determining which tab is active is basically a guessing game. Gruber acknowledged that it is easier to discern the active tab when more than two tabs are open, but he said the confusion with exactly two tabs should have been reason enough to scrap the design change.



"I can't tell you how many times I closed the tab that I needed because of this," one Reddit user expressed in frustration.



Unfortunately for users who do not like the new design, Apple has not made any changes to the shading of tabs in either the Safari 15.1 beta or the latest version of the experimental Safari Technology Preview browser.

Golden Knights goaltender Robin Lehner put Alain Vigneault and the Flyers on blast with the belief that the team is distributing highly addictive drugs to its players.
 The big story from Saturday night should have been the Flyers’ 3-1 win over the Washington Capitals. However, the hockey community was buzzing after Vegas Golden Knights goaltender Robin Lehner made some pretty gargantuan accusations about the Flyers and their medical practices.
Minutes after the Flyers’ first victory of the preseason, Lehner took to Twitter to accuse the Flyers of giving benzodiazepines (benzos) and Ambien — highly addictive drugs used to treat anxiety and insomnia — to its players.
He then demanded that the Flyers fire head coach Alain Vigne…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai, reporting for Motherboard:
A company that is a critical part of the global telecommunications
infrastructure used by AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and several others
around the world such as Vodafone and China Mobile, quietly
disclosed that hackers were inside its systems for years,
impacting more than 200 of its clients and potentially millions of
cellphone users worldwide.
The company, Syniverse, revealed in a filing dated September 27
with the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission that an
unknown “individual or organization gained unauthorized access to
databases within its network on several occasions, and that login
information allowing access to or from its Electronic Data
Transfer (EDT) environment was compromised for approximately 235
of its customers.”
For a moment I thought, 235 customers — that’s not too bad. Then I realized that Syniverse’s “customers” are entire carriers, not individual people. So, yeah, this is bad.
Syniverse repeatedly declined to answer specific questions from
Motherboard about the scale of the breach and what specific data
was affected, but according to a person who works at a telephone
carrier, whoever hacked Syniverse could have had access to
metadata such as length and cost, caller and receiver’s numbers,
the location of the parties in the call, as well as the content of
SMS text messages. […]
The company wrote that it discovered the breach in May 2021, but
that the hack began in May of 2016.
Not what you want.

Just in time for Halloween!
 Ghosts are very scary, and this is why Phasmophobia is an exciting game. Players take the role of amateur ghost hunters, plumbing the depths of suburban homes and abandoned high schools in search of specters. It looks like a new kind of ghoul is coming to the game, according to a post on Kinetic Games’ social media.
The teaser image shows two new ghost types, although their names and the specifics are blurred out. This brings the total number of ghosts in the game to 18. Previous updates have included new types like the Yokai and the Hantu, who hail from different regions around the world
What could they be? Very spooky   #Phasmophobia pic.twitter.com/rmo9mXehtL

These two new mysterious ghost friends appear to be part of the Halloween Update, which is currently listed as “In Progress” on the developer’s public Trello board. In addition, there is an upcoming Nightmare Difficulty option for particularly hardy hunters, some features that are simply marked as REDACTED, and more.
More details about Phasmophobia’s next update will be released closer to Halloween, but it looks like it’ll be a great time to pick the flashlight back up and explore what the early access title has to offer. Since launch, Kinetic Games has continued to add features to the game that help make it a mainstay on Twitch, with features like new ghosts and levels, or the ability to scare your friends by throwing things at them as a ghost after you’ve died.]]></summary>

Hades and Rocket League will be among the first to get Epic Achievements
 The Epic Games Store is finally getting a unified achievement system. The system is called Epic Achievements, and it will be added to a few games starting next week, Epic announced Monday. 
Epic Achievements will be available first for Rocket League, Hades, Pillars of Eternity, Humankind, Zombie Army 4, Defense Grid, and a few more titles that Epic hasn’t announced yet. Other developers will get access to the tools soon, which means that even more games should be getting their official Epic Achievements before the end of the year. 
The details page of each game with Epic Achievements will display all achievements, as well as progress toward unlocking them. The achievements will also give XP that will level up Epic accounts, letting players show off their feats to their friends. The rarer — and more difficult — the achievement, the more experience it will give. Here’s a list of the achievement tiers and how much XP they can grant.
Bronze — 5-45 XP
Silver — 50-95 XP
Gold — 100-200 XP   
Platinum — 250 XP
This isn’t the first time that games on the Epic Games Store have had achievements, but it is the first time those achievements will be part of a unified system that will be tracked outside of each individual game. Thankfully, all of the developer achievements, which were exclusive to specific games before, will still be available in any game they were a part of. 
In fact, according to Epic, if a game previously had developer achievements and switches over to the new Epic Achievements, all progress will carry over right away, and you’ll get the XP you already earned.]]></summary>

        <updated>2021-10-04T15:48:50.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[John Jurgensen, writing for The Wall Street Journal (News+):
Now he’s attempting to re-engage with a show that offers fewer
jokes and a more earnest agenda. With his new biweekly series,
“The Problem With Jon Stewart,” his first challenge is getting
people to notice it at all. Apple TV+ is decidedly more plush but
less entrenched than basic cable.
Fans will find aspects of “The Problem With Jon Stewart” familiar.
In front of an audience, he sits at a table for an opening
monologue (now wearing a T-shirt and bomber jacket instead of a
suit and tie). He twirls his pen, pauses for deadpan stares into
the camera, stifles giggles behind his fist and makes
self-deprecating cracks like, “I am what’s left of Jon Stewart.”
Breaking from his previous format, the show includes unscripted
segments in the show’s writers’ room, where Mr. Stewart and his
staff banter over each episode’s topic (expanded on in a weekly
companion podcast). A separate panel discussion captures the
show’s sober tone.
I watched the first episode and was bored to tears. I certainly sympathize with the plight of U.S. veterans who’ve been gravely harmed by the burning of toxic waste, but the show itself felt like a droll hour-long lecture — not a good sign when the show was in fact only 40 minutes long. Strong “When is this going to be over?” vibes. It was like being stuck back in school.
I’m not saying Stewart can or should only do comedy. I like serious issue-based shows, too, but the good ones, like 60 Minutes, move along at a fast clip. John Oliver’s Last Week Tonight devotes itself to the most serious issues in the world today, but the show is entertaining, fast-paced, and funny as hell. It moves. The premiere of The Problem With Jon Stewart can only be described as “plodding”. I’ll give it another shot this week, but one more like last week’s and I’m out.

Choo-Choo Charles is a terrifying concept
 Survival horror train game Choo-Choo Charles looks like the unusual combination of Blair Witch and The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks, with a Thomas the Tank Engine-fueled nightmare for extra spice. It’s the logical conclusion of nearly a decade of Thomas the Tank Engine video game mods, only the locomotive here isn’t a stand-in for a Skyrim dragon, but a bloodthirsty, spider-legged monstrosity named Charles.
Two Star Games’ announced Choo-Choo Charles on Friday, and a viral tweet from the developer quickly illustrated the appeal of this unique horror game. Turns out no one wants to be chased by a hungry-for-human-flesh spider-train-beast, but they do want to play a video game where you can upgrade a modest train with a mounted machine gun and kill that kind of creature.
According to Choo-Choo Charles’ official description, Charles is terrifying a local village and it’s up to you to destroy him. You’ll complete missions for local townsfolk, loot for scraps to upgrade your train’s armor, mobility, and damage, and ultimately take down Charles.
While Two Star Games’ newest release seems perfect for Spooky Month, Choo-Choo Charles won’t be out until the first quarter of 2022, according to its Steam listing. In the meantime, Two Star Games has three free horror games on Steam you can try: Cloud Climber, My Friend is a Raven, and Night in Riverager.]]></summary>

Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.



Amazon's wording on the sale is somewhat confusing, so if you don't see the sale automatically applied at checkout, you can use the code APPLEOCT at the checkout screen to get the deal. For most shoppers, however, the deal should apply automatically.



It's been just over a year since we last tracked deals on iTunes gift cards, because Apple phased those out in favor of the new Apple Gift Card. This makes Amazon's sale today of particular note, since you won't find a straight cash discount on these cards again, but can at least get credit added to your Amazon account.




$10 CREDIT
$100 Apple Gift Card at Amazon





All of the Apple Gift Cards on this page are supported under the new promotion, as long as you customize one to be worth $100 or more. The gift cards are sold by ACI Gift Cards, LLC, which is owned by Amazon and was related to iTunes gift card discounts in the past.

        <updated>2021-10-04T14:52:25.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kevin Roose’s take on the inside look at Facebook revealed by The Wall Street Journal’s “Facebook Files” series, which in turn is based on Frances Haugen’s whistleblower leaks:
It’s far too early to declare Facebook dead. The company’s stock
price has risen nearly 30 percent in the past year, lifted by
strong advertising revenue and a spike in use of some products
during the pandemic. Facebook is still growing in countries
outside the United States, and could succeed there even if it
stumbles domestically. And the company has invested heavily in
newer initiatives, like augmented and virtual reality products,
that could turn the tide if they’re successful.
But Facebook’s research tells a clear story, and it’s not a happy
one. Its younger users are flocking to Snapchat and TikTok, and
its older users are posting anti-vaccine memes and arguing about
politics. Some Facebook products are actively shrinking, while
others are merely making their users angry or self-conscious.
Facebook’s declining relevance with young people shouldn’t
necessarily make its critics optimistic. History teaches us that
social networks rarely age gracefully, and that tech companies can
do a lot of damage on the way down.

Haugen stated that some of Facebook’s own research found that
“angry content” is more likely to receive engagement, something
that content producers and political parties are aware of.
“One of the most shocking pieces of information that I brought out
of Facebook that I think is essential to this disclosure is
political parties have been quoted, in Facebook’s own research,
saying, we know you changed how you pick out the content that goes
in the home feed,” said Haugen. “And now if we don’t publish
angry, hateful, polarizing, divisive content, crickets. We don’t
get anything. And we don’t like this. We know our constituents
don’t like this. But if we don’t do these stories, we don’t get
distributed. And so it used to be that we did very little of it,
and now we have to do a lot of it, because we have jobs to do. And
if we don’t get traffic and engagement, we’ll lose our jobs.”
Haugen’s whistleblowing jibes exactly with my theory all along: Facebook prioritizes growth and engagement over all else, and when they discovered that polarizing angering content drives engagement more than anything else, they let it fly. It’s that simple.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple Newsroom:
Apple today announced Apple Watch Series 7, featuring the largest
and most advanced Apple Watch display ever — and a reengineered
Always-On Retina display with significantly more screen area and
thinner borders — will be available to order beginning Friday,
October 8, at 5 a.m. PDT and available in stores starting Friday,
October 15.
So the Series 7 watches are only shipping three weeks after the iPhones 13. Not bad, but let’s see how supply-constrained they are.
While I’m writing about Apple Watch, let me put on the record my theory about the flat-sides industrial design that a slew of rumor guys claimed was coming for Series 7, but in fact, did not. (I put forth this theory on the latest episode of The Talk Show, with guest Jason Snell.)

An awe-inspiring odyssey
 I don’t function well under pressure. So when my parents and teachers told me that I’m the last hope of my people, I was prepared to be pretty stressed about the next steps. Then, a couple of hours later, I’m chasing a pink light known as a brine wisp above beautiful crystal waters, doing donuts above the ocean while playing with this new life form.
Jett: The Far Shore delights in these contrasts.  
We’ve all been to space before — I personally love dabbling (and, occasionally, dying horrifically) in games like No Man’s Sky and Hardspace Shipbreaker. But while other games focus on the danger or the adventure of interstellar travel, Jett places all of its emphasis on the unsettling, awe-inspiring, and utterly alien beauty …]]></summary>

“There was a lot of trial and error” when putting the book together, says Kumkum. For starters, what does one say to their future family members? Ki Saigon decided to provide a guide for the letters, asking each participant to imagine what they would like to hear from them, given the fact the book will still be around in 1000 years. Each letter is also hand written, adding another dimension to the project while “staying true to the spirit of the project.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today announced that pre-orders for the new Apple Watch Series 7 will start on Friday, October 8, with availability on Friday, October 15. 





While Apple announced the Series 7 alongside the iPhone 13 last month, the company didn't provide any information on availability besides saying it will be available "later this fall." The new Apple Watch will officially be available for pre-orders at 5 a.m. PDT on Friday, October 8, and will start shipping a week later on Friday, October 15.



The Series 7, compared to the Series 6, features a larger display with slightly more rounded corners, which allows the display to appear to curve on the sides. The new Series 7 also sports improved IP6X certification for dust resistance in addition to WR50 water resistance. The new watch, however, keeps the same CPU as the Series 6. 



The Series 7 comes in five aluminum case finishes, including a refined blue case, (PRODUCT)RED, midnight, starlight, and green. Stainless steel options in silver, graphite, and gold stainless steel alongside "Apple Watch Edition" in titanium and black titanium will also be available. The Series 7 starts at $399 and joins the Apple Watch SE and the Apple Watch Series 3 in the lineup.

Remedy’s Alan Wake: Remastered doesn’t add much, but it’s a great excuse to replay a classic
 Alan Wake is a frustrating masterpiece. It’s rife with charm, and overflowing with a mysterious atmosphere, and both are on display in Alan Wake: Remastered more than ever before. However, its issues are still as glaring as they were 11 years ago, and this remaster does nothing to mitigate them.
Let’s get this out of the way up front: The actual act of playing Alan Wake was already boring in 2010. By today’s standards, it’s a legitimate slog. A good 40% of certain levels consist of just jogging through the woods or down a road, and Alan can only run for about five seconds without slowing down and huffing for air — a relatable trait, from one writer …]]></summary>

Spotted by Richard Mazkewich and Kosta Eleftheriou and highlighted by The Verge, the option allows users to report individual ‌App Store‌ listings in iOS 15. When selected, the option directs users to a website with a drop-down menu to report ‌App Store‌ violations, including a specific option to "Report a scam or fraud."



The previous option, which was difficult to access, allowed users to "Report suspicious activity" redirected to Apple Support. Users were only able to report "a quality issue" with apps if they had actually paid for a scam app or in-app purchase, meaning that there was no ability to easily report obvious scams.




In a major reversal, Apple quietly added back the “Report a Problem” @AppStore button in iOS 15: pic.twitter.com/UopiPDEV7e
— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) October 3, 2021
 




The "Report a Problem" option appears to be rolling out slowly, starting with free apps with in-app purchases on the ‌App Store‌ in the United States. The addition comes just days after Apple added the ability for users to rate their own apps on the ‌App Store‌.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The iPhone 13 Pro costs Apple around $20 more to build compared to last year's iPhone 12 Pro, but despite the lower margin of revenue for the company, the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ still starts at the same $999 price point as last year's entry-level Pro iPhone.





TechInsights did a costs analysis breakdown of the new ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌, finding that due to higher component costs related to the improved camera, A15 Bionic chip, ProMotion displays, and presumably the large battery, the newest ‌iPhone‌ costs $570 to build, while the ‌iPhone 12‌ Pro cost merely $548. Compared to the Samsung Galaxy S21+, both iPhones are however significantly more expensive to build.





The increase in build costs from the ‌iPhone 12‌ Pro to the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ is notable but not as pronounced as last year's increase from the iPhone 11. The ‌iPhone 12‌ introduced 5G support, a new 5nm chip, and the return of flat edges. Those changes resulted in the iPhone 12 being 21% more expensive for Apple to build than the ‌iPhone 11‌.



In the run-up to the launch of the iPhone 13 and ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ last month, a report suggested that due to increased costs for chip production, Apple would increase the price of the iPhone 13 as a means of compensating. That did not occur, and Apple instead kept the same price points for the ‌iPhone 13‌, on top of introducing more aggressive carrier subsidies. Another report suggested that Apple was looking at new ways to assemble the cameras in an ‌iPhone‌ to save costs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple has toggled end-to-end encryption for Safari bookmarks in iCloud, further expanding the type of user data that the company fully encrypts, offering the highest level of privacy and data protection.





Spotted on Reddit, an update to Apple's "iCloud security overview" page has indicated that alongside Safari tabs and history, Safari bookmarks are now end-to-end encrypted, meaning no one, not even Apple, can access users' saved Safari bookmarks. Based on the timing of the update, Apple likely did this change around the release of iOS and iPadOS 15. Apple didn't respond to a request for comment.



With Safari bookmarks now an added data point that's end-to-end encrypted, what remains not end-to-end encrypted is worth noting. ‌iCloud‌ backups, for example, are only protected using 128-bit AES encryption, alongside Photos, Reminders, Notes, and more. In recent months, Apple has come under pressure to make iCloud Photos and ‌iCloud‌ backups fully end-to-end encrypted, but the company has yet to make those changes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tuesday marks 10 years since Apple co-founder Steve Jobs passed away, and those who met him have begun to share stories about his life.





CNET's Roger Cheng today recounted his memory of Jobs visiting The Wall Street Journal's headquarters in New York to offer him and a small group of other reporters an early look at a prototype iPhone, shortly after the device was unveiled in 2007.



Cheng revealed that when one reporter asked about the iPhone's durability, Jobs reacted by tossing the prototype he was holding into the air toward the center of the room, resulting in a small gasp followed by immediate silence as the device hit the carpeted floor. Cheng said the iPhone survived unscathed, adding that the move was the kind of calculated risk that Jobs was known to take as a showman.



"The memory underscores the kind of lengths Jobs went to in order to make an impression," wrote Cheng. "Imagine how disastrous it would've been if that iPhone had broken or shut down in front of so many journalists."






Jobs famously introduced the original iPhone as if it were three separate products: a widescreen iPod with touch controls, a revolutionary mobile phone, and a breakthrough internet communications device. The crowd at Macworld San Francisco erupted with cheerful applause upon realizing that Jobs was referring to a single device.



Jobs passed away October 5, 2011 at the age of 56. Apple maintains a Remembering Steve page on its website with messages from people all over the world.

Some observations for your morning. 
 They did it! After two somewhat dicey showings to start the preseason, the Flyers were back last night with just about as close to their opening night roster as you could get against the Capitals, and with a pretty strong showing, they were able to pick up their first win of the preseason. It wasn’t perfect, but it was certainly a right direction, and if nothing else, a solid start for what very well could be that opening night lineup. It’s a bit of positivity, and we’ll certainly take it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After its first event of the fall, Apple is on track to hold a Mac focused event within the next month, where it will debut brand new MacBook Pros with a faster "M1X" Apple silicon chip, an updated design, and improved display technology, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.





Apple last year held its Mac event in November, but in the past, it has held Mac events in October. Till now, there's been some unknown about whether Apple will stick with its November or October timeframe for this year. 



In his latest Power On newsletter, Gurman says the company is poised to announce M1X powered MacBook Pros within the next month, noting that "Apple typically does its major new Mac introductions in October. So stay tuned." In the paywalled section of the newsletter, Gurman also reiterated what we can expect performance-wise from the new machines. 

The Apple M1X chip, the likely name for a more graphics-intense and professional-focused M1 chip, is indeed still on tap for 2021. We'll likely see it show up first in a new range of MacBook Pros in the next month and a higher-end Mac mini at some point. The M1X has been developed in two variations: both with 10 CPU cores (eight high-performance and two high-efficiency) and either 16 or 32 graphics cores.
Previous report suggests that alongside the new MacBook Pros, Apple may also announce a redesigned Mac mini. Apple last month announced the iPhone 13, Apple Watch Series 7, a new generation iPad, and the sixth-generation iPad mini, and besides new Macs, the company is also rumored to be releasing third-generation AirPods before the end of this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amid rumors that the Apple Watch Series 7 could go on sale in just a matter of weeks, new images shared with MacRumors allegedly show the new Apple Watch in the wild, giving us our first real-world look at Apple's latest watch.





The images were initially posted on a Facebook group for Apple Watch enthusiasts, but it has been taken down since its posting. The poster of the photos claimed that they are working for a carrier who was testing the Series 7 before it officially goes on sale "later this fall."



We've so far only seen the Series 7 in Apple's marketing and promotional materials, and the company has yet to announce a date for when it will be available for purchase. The images shared today offer us our first hands-on look at the Series 7 with its larger and more expansive display. Despite rumors, the Series 7 does not feature flat-edges but instead "more rounded and softer corners," which allows the display to curve slightly over the sides.



The larger display is one of just a few design changes for the Series 7 compared to the previous generation. The Series 7 features an improved IP6X rating for dust and water resistance but internally maintains the same CPU as the Apple Watch Series 6.



While there certainly could be more internal changes for the Series 7, we'll have to wait until we get our hands on the watch itself to learn about them. For a full rundown of everything we know, be sure to check out our comprehensive roundup.

 The Philadelphia Flyers looked like, well, the Philadelphia Flyers for the first time this preseason against the Washington Capitals. 
After mixed lineups in their first two games with several AHL (or worse) players on the ice, Alain Vigneault sent out all of the Flyers’ big guns in this one. The Flyers lineup we saw tonight just might be the lineup that we see against the Vancouver Canucks on October 15th.
The Flyers were the much better team throughout the game in their 3-1 win. Claude Giroux, Cam Atkinson, and Scott Laughton lit the lamp as Martin Jones made 21 saves on 22 shots in the victory.

Good things please?
 We’re back with a bit of weekend hockey on deck! After dropping their first two games of the preseason this week to the Islanders and Bruins, the Flyers are back with most of their big guns in tow and hoping to pick up a win over the Capitals tonight. They’ll be facing a Capitals team without a number of their biggest contributors, so if there was ever a time they could pull a reverse and take advantage of a bit of a talent mismatch, well, the time is now. 



Three players to watch
1. Martin Jones
Alain Vigneault noted in practice yesterday that Jones is set to play the whole of tonight’s game, and then Carter Hart will get the nod on Monday. It’s a relatively quick turnaround for Jones, who played the first ha…]]></summary>

But some of Facebook’s containment has at times backfired with
its own workers. This week, the company downplayed the internal
research that The Journal had partly based its articles on,
suggesting that the findings were limited and imprecise. That
angered some employees who had worked on the research, three
people said. They have congregated on group chats to decry the
characterizations as unfair, and some have privately threatened
to quit.
That’s what it takes for these researchers to think about quitting Facebook? Their research shows that Facebook is doing harm to society and harm to teenagers, but what makes them threaten to leave is having their work disparaged? What a magnet for sociopaths this company is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple has canceled its plans to release an updated iPad Air with an OLED display next year due to concerns around quality and costs, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said today in an investor note obtained by MacRumors. 





In March, Kuo reported that Apple had an ‌iPad Air‌ with an OLED display in the pipeline for next year. Today, Kuo has revised his prediction, saying that will not be the case since Apple has canceled those plans due to costs and performance not meeting the company's expectations. 



Kuo had previously stated that the 11-inch iPad Pro would be receiving a mini-LED display next year, and Kuo today doubled down on that claim by saying it will be the "focus of [the] iPad line in 2022." Currently, only the 12.9-inch iPad Pro includes the newer mini-LED technology. One reason Kuo states that Apple had canceled its OLED ‌iPad Air‌ is that it may have been detrimental to the sales of the forthcoming 11-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ with a mini-LED display. 



While Apple plans to stick with an LCD display for the ‌iPad Air‌, Kuo says the company continues to research and develop newer display technologies for the ‌iPad‌ line. A report last week suggested that Apple and Samsung had abandoned their joint plans to develop an OLED display for a forthcoming updated 10.9-inch ‌iPad Air‌.

He may actually be the best forward on the team at this rate. 
 If it isn’t fairly apparent from even a cursory glance, Joel Farabee is a quality hockey player. 
At Broad Street Hockey, we’ve all sung his praises fairly regularly. He was ranked second in our top 25 under 25, improved on his performances substantially, and when his name was being kicked around in Seth Jones trade rumors, it was shut right down. Fortunately, the Flyers signaled their intentions by near immediately signing Farabee to a new contract. 
To state the obvious once again, Farabee was a lone bright spot in a season of disappointment in 2020-21, though it is becoming clear his season was not an anomaly, as he has shown consistent growth and maturity. T…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today ended a program that offered customers with possibly defective iPhone 8 models with a free repair for their logic board, which in some cases caused the device to restart and become unresponsive. 





The program officially launched in August of 2018 and targeted a "very small percentage" of ‌iPhone‌ 8 devices that may have had a defective logic board. According to Apple, at the time, affected models were sold between September 2017 and March 2018 in China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Macau, New Zealand, and the U.S. The ‌iPhone‌ 8 Plus was not part of the program, and Apple had previously prompted customers to its support website to check if they were eligible for a free repair.



Now, the program has officially ended, and Apple has removed it from its repair program list on its website. The program ran for more than three years, and while it has finished, customers still experiencing issues with their ‌iPhone‌ 8 should still contact Apple support as they may still be willing to help.

"Some users may not be able to apply for Apple Card, pay their bill, lock/unlock their physical card, request a new or replacement physical card, or request a new card number," reads a notice posted on Apple's system status page.



The issues began within the past few hours and affect only some cardholders. We'll update this story when Apple indicates the issues have been resolved.




Looks like there’s issues paying #AppleCard @MacRumors @9to5mac. My payment errored twice but I received a receipt for my Apple Cash withdraw. The money is gone from my Apple Cash but hasn’t been applied to the card. Also no clue if my bank draft went through or not. What a mess. pic.twitter.com/jrm75Mubrb

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple on late Thursday seeded the first beta of Safari 15.1 for macOS Big Sur and macOS Catalina to developers for testing. Safari 15.1 beta is also included in the eighth beta of macOS Monterey seeded earlier this week.





The release notes for the Safari 15.1 beta are largely recycled from the initial release of Safari 15, but in our own testing, the beta appears to fix an issue where bookmarking a YouTube page would result in the browser crashing. Apple will likely be implementing additional bug fixes by the time Safari 15.1 is released to the public, but an issue with the browser showing old tabs upon being reopened does not appear to be fixed yet.



Safari 15.1 beta can be downloaded from the Apple Developer website on the More Downloads page when logged in. In order to install the beta, developers must be running the latest versions of macOS Big Sur or macOS Catalina, according to Apple. 



Safari 15 features redesigned tabs that have a rounder and more defined appearance, faster performance, improved security, and more. The browser will come preinstalled on macOS Monterey when the software update is released later this year, and Apple has also made the browser available for macOS Big Sur and macOS Catalina users.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Image: Bandai Namco Entertainment
    

  
Publisher says it ‘reflects our new Purpose,’ yes, with a capital P
 Bandai Namco is messing with its branding again. Don’t worry, it’s not changing back to Namco Bandai. No, it’s just ditching its logo (Orange 021 C and good ol’ Process Yellow making a rich Pantone 185 C) in favor of an anodyne word-balloon wordmark.
In a statement, the company said the outgoing logo “expresses the fusion of Bandai and Namco that was created when the two companies integrated,” although not necessarily in that order, back in 2006. “It will be replaced with a new logo that reflects our new Purpose.”
Sooooo … what is that new purpose? If you had “Fun for All into the Future,” on your bingo card, come to the desk for your prize. “Bandai Namco exists to share dreams, fun, and inspiration with people around the world,” the company said in the same statement.
Image: Bandai Namco Entertainment
  
“Connecting people and societies in the enjoyment of uniquely entertaining products and services, we’re working to create a brighter future for everyone,” says the Purpose. That’s putting a lot on Goku’s shoulders, but he’ll manage.
So, anyway, it’s now Bandai Namco inside a word balloon, taking effect in April 2022. As to that, Bandai Namco says the balloon is an homage to “Japan’s manga culture that has become so popular everywhere.” And Bandai Namco is a big stakeholder in that culture, with Dragon Ball, Gundam, Naruto, and several other anime and manga franchises in its stable.
Still, some fans seem not to be diggin’ it. Kotaku on Friday morning pointed out that users on 2ch, Japan’s largest bulletin board, were throwing shade on Bandai Namco’s new look:
“Looks like Twitch’s logo,” says one (speaking for me, too). “And the orange logo was so nice,” said another. And, speaking for most of us, “It’s fine. I don’t really care about logos.”]]></summary>

South Korean Internet service provider SK Broadband has sued
Netflix to pay for costs from increased network traffic and
maintenance work because of a surge of viewers to the U.S. firm’s
content, an SK spokesperson said on Friday.
The move comes after a Seoul court said Netflix should
“reasonably” give something in return to the internet service
provider for network usage, and multiple South Korean lawmakers
have spoken out against content providers who do not pay for
network usage despite generating explosive traffic.
Some really odd legal decisions and laws coming out of South Korea lately. I detect a whiff of protectionism. Would they be going after app store payment systems if the dominant one belonged to Samsung? I doubt it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple CEO Tim Cook is in New York City today for a meeting with Margrethe Vestager, the European Commissioner for Competition, according to a person familiar with the matter. Vestager was a keynote speaker at Fordham University's annual Conference on International Antitrust Law and Policy earlier today.





It's unclear when Cook and Vestager are scheduled to meet or what topics will be on the agenda. In April, the European Commission informed Apple of its preliminary view that it abused its dominant position for the distribution of music streaming apps through the App Store by charging high commission fees on Apple Music rivals like Spotify, which had filed a complaint against Apple with the European Commission in 2019.



While in New York, Cook stopped in at Apple's retail store in the SoHo neighborhood this morning, sharing a photo of his visit on Twitter. Cook also tweeted a photo of his visit to the International Center of Photography.




Good morning Apple SoHo! 👋 Great to feel the excitement and energy, from team members and customers alike! pic.twitter.com/frOZVgvbMa

Following his trip to New York, Cook is reportedly scheduled to speak at the Silicon Slopes Summit in Salt Lake City, Utah on October 13, and he will headline a fundraising dinner on the same day. In late August, Cook reached his 10th year as Apple CEO.

BULLSHIT [Cranks up the volume on metal music]
 At first, Jack, the protagonist from Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin, didn’t seem all that notable. He was just the dude who wore a plain black shirt in one of the most fashionable and eye-catching franchises in the history of JRPGs. However, the man continues to make a name for himself, and not just for his fashion choices. Gameplay from a new demo for Stranger of Paradise shows an absurd, extremely emo scene: Jack says “Bullshit” and blasts metal music in his wireless earbuds, before strutting out of the castle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All possible configurations of the iPhone 13 Pro and ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ Max are currently showing a 3 to 4-week, even up to a month delay in shipments in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, with in-store stock varying in availability.





At the time of writing, in the United States, every possible configuration of the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ Max, regardless of color or storage, shows a 3 to 4 week wait time for shipments, with in-store stock varying across the country. In the United Kingdom and Canada, the situation seems direr, with all configurations showing up with up to a one-month delay, also with in-store stock varying. The iPhone 13 and ‌iPhone 13‌ mini seem less affected, with expected shipment delays and availability across all stores.



Apple's CEO Tim Cook warned during the company's last earnings calls that industry-wide shortages could be impacting iPhone production in the coming months, added on top of increased demand for the latest iPhones. The ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ Max are likely doing well thanks to ProMotion displays and improved camera capabilities. 



Early analyst numbers suggested that pre-order demand for the new high-end iPhones was initially off to a strong start. Despite the phones having started shipping to customers one week ago, the supply continues to be dry. 



Apple's suppliers are reportedly struggling to keep up with Apple's high demand for the new iPhones amid the global health crisis and new energy regulation in China. Apple's supply chain will continue to be more strained in the coming months thanks to new MacBook Pros and the imminent launch of the Apple Watch Series 7.

Fans told to expect a big post-launch roadmap, but not for fixing a mess like this
 Well, Pro Evolution Soccer’s transition to fully free-to-play eFootball is quite the hot mess.
Konami’s futbol game launched on Wednesday with player expectations already set into the future, thanks to a development roadmap promising a lot of core features coming via title updates. But that doesn’t even begin to account for the cavalcade of jank players have encountered — particularly PC players, who have made it the worst-rated Steam game of all time, according to one site’s metric.
What exactly is going on? Well, this:

Office 2021 includes many of the collaboration features already available to Microsoft 365 subscribers, such as real-time co-authoring of documents and Microsoft Teams access for chatting and video calling with others. Microsoft outlined additional new features in a support document, including new inking tools, data types, functions, translation and editing tools, motion graphics, ease-of-use features, and more.



The non-subscription version of Office Home and Student 2021 is priced at $149.99 in the United States and includes access to Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote for personal use.

Julianna and Colt spend the game trading bullets and quips with each other. Their chemistry was my favorite part of the game — that is, until Deathloop’s ending left me cold.

Square Enix’s Dungeon Encounters features a fat cat and a pup with a sword in its mouth
 On Friday, Square Enix revealed Dungeon Encounters, a new dungeon crawler led by Final Fantasy veteran Hiroyuki Ito, the director of Final Fantasy 6, Final Fantasy 9, and Final Fantasy 12, and the creator of the franchise’s classic Active Time Battle system. To describe Ito’s new game as minimalist might be underselling it; players appear to walk through grid-based labyrinths, are rewarded for mapping them out, and occasionally fall into menu-based battles against monsters. Dungeon Encounters’ first trailer is perplexing and perhaps a bit distressing for fans of Ito’s past work — but I remain hopeful.
In addition to Ito, Final Fantasy 12: The Zodiac Age producer Hiroaki Kato — who also worked on Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together and two Final Fantasy Tactics games for Square Enix — is also working on the game. Musical director Nobuo Uematsu is “overseeing” the soundtrack, and Dungeon Encounters features character art from designer Ryoma Ito, whose talents are on display here.

While it appears we’ll see many of the game’s characters in 2D static artwork form, there is a big fat cat named Sir Cat and a dachshund with a sword in its mouth named Jufren, and I already want to spend time with them.
Beyond that, Square Enix promises “100 levels of thought-provoking challenges,” so I’m approaching Dungeon Encounters from the angle of “this looks like a good puzzle game, not something with an actual budget” and hoping for the best.
Dungeon Encounters will be available digitally for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Windows PC via Steam on Oct. 14. The game will cost $29.99, but is currently discounted to $23.99 for pre-orders.]]></summary>

It wasn’t pretty, but hey, it’s preseason!
 1. Joel Farabee is still amazing
Farabee broke out in a big way last season by leading the Flyers in goals. Last night, he picked up right where he left off scoring the only two goals of the game for the good guys. The first flashed his special talent of finding the soft spots in the defense against a very good Bruins penalty kill. JVR made a beautiful pass from the goal line to a cutting Farabee and he snapped the shot by Swayman. His instincts are arguably his greatest talent, and they were on full display on this goal.

Amazon doesn’t quite capture the magic of an MMO
 New World promises a lush and strange continent for players to explore and conquer, full with dangerous enemies and the promise of glory and treasure. It’s a modern MMORPG in every way — absolutely gorgeous, surprisingly stable for launch, and well voice-acted. There’s also an extensive network of constant player communication. While the queues are piling up, and players are trying to join the same server as all of their friends, once I get online I enjoy a smooth ride through developer Amazon's world of adventure.
New World feels like the first MMO designed without World of Warcraft’s DNA as a core feature. It’s not concerned with killing Blizzard’s goliath, but rather, content to be something of its own…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The third-generation AirPods are still on track to be launched before the end of this year, despite their lack of appearance during the iPhone 13 and Apple Watch Series 7 event earlier last month, according to DigiTimes.





Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reported the weekend before Apple's September 14 "California streaming" event that the third-generation ‌AirPods‌ would make an appearance during the fully digital event. While that did not happen, the new ‌AirPods‌ are rumored to already be in mass production, and Apple is seemingly gearing up to launch them before the end of the year.



The new ‌AirPods‌ will be the first significant update to the ‌AirPods‌ lineup since the AirPods Pro three years ago. The new ‌AirPods‌ are expected to feature an updated design that takes inspiration from the higher-end ‌AirPods Pro‌ but lacking in "Pro" features. Rumors are unclear on whether the new ‌AirPods‌ will feature silicone ear tips or not, as leaked images and renders depict both possibilities.



Apple announced its ‌AirPods Pro‌ via a press release in 2019, and besides their initial announcement on stage in 2016, ‌AirPods‌ have not yet been given dedicated airtime during an Apple event. Apple could announce the new third-generation ‌AirPods‌ via a press release in the coming weeks, or alternatively include them in its rumored second event for the fall, expected to take place later this month or in November.

How the game tries to lure long-time fans of the franchise
 Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin, the new action game from Koei Tecmo’s Team Ninja and Square Enix, immediately feels different from its Final Fantasy predecessors. Just one hour into the game, I found myself clawing through a magical forest as its protagonist, the manly-man Jack, slew a beautiful griffin by grabbing it by the head and then body-slamming it to the ground with a well-timed finisher. As the beast died, blood-colored crystals burst from its body, and then the creature evaporated into thin air. A Final Fantasy game has never felt so brutal. 
This high-difficulty Souls-like spinoff will be a “bold new vision” for the Final Fantasy franchise, according to producer Jin Fujiwara, and o…]]></summary>

Just a little Glass Houses reference for you there.
 The Philadelphia Flyers and Boston Bruins allegedly played tonight, although it was hard to tell behind a deluge of hilarious technical difficulties via NHL on TNT. To be honest, being largely unable to see what was happening on the screen might have been to fans’ benefit. What did we learn, who stood out, and what were the funniest live production gaffes of the night? Let’s dive in.
What went right?
Joel Farabee looked like his usually dazzling self, scoring two beautiful goals on the power play.
Let’s back on track in the second period.

As we’ve detailed in the past, it can be quite confusing when
trying to find the correct USB-C cable for your devices. Even
though the connectors all look the same, USB-C cables all meet
different standards for power delivery speeds, data transfer, and
more. Here are the highlights of the USB-IF’s announcements today:
USB-IF establishes new Certified USB Type-C Cable Logos to
display cable power capabilities in watts, clearly indicating
support for 60W or 240W as defined by the USB Power Delivery 3.1
Specification.


Certified USB4 Logos updated in parallel to unify branding
across the Certified USB Logo Program.




These beautiful, totally professionally-designed new logos will clear it all up, I’m sure. Perhaps with a little regulatory help from the product design savants on the European Commission.

 World of Warcraft Classic was a return to a simpler time, without the bells and whistles of the modern retail game. But time kept marching onwards, and Classic has proven popular enough to lead to the game’s first expansion, Burning Crusade, to have its own Classic iteration. Now Blizzard is returning to Classic with Season of Mastery, a fresh start to the throwback style that begins its open beta on Oct. 5.
Season of Mastery will have some changes to the World of Warcraft Classic experience, which Blizzard has detailed in a blog post on its official site. The six content release phases will remain, but they’ll unlock much faster, with the full cycle completing within 12 months.

Deathloop has no sense of morality, and that makes it fun
 I didn’t expect to like Deathloop. Don’t get me wrong, I loved its vibe from the moment I saw the first trailer. A ’60s murder thriller with classic spy vibes? What isn’t there to like? But knowing Deathloop was an Arkane joint had me skeptical — I’ve always enjoyed Arkane’s worlds, but seldom the way the studio marries gameplay and story. Still, hearing it was one of the best games of the year, I dove in feet first. And I found a playground that finally let me engage in my preferred playstyle without mucking up the story.
Deathloop’s world is inherently chaotic. Using Colt’s own vernacular, he’s on Blackreef to fuck shit up and he doesn’t care who gets hurt in the proc…]]></summary>

According to Apple's release notes, the update "improves the security of macOS." It's not clear why it's being released as a beta rather than to all users, but there's also a developer beta of a security update available for macOS Catalina as well.

Train your Grey Knights, kick Chaos butt
 Warhammer 40k is a rich setting with tons of bad guys to punch, and many of the games that exist in the setting let you do so with aplomb. The upcoming Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters takes a different, more tactical approach to things. In Chaos Gate, players take the role of the Space Marine chapter known as the Grey Knights, and take the fight to Chaos in an X-Com style game.
The Grey Knights are a mysterious Space Marine chapter; while games like Space Marine focus on the Ultramarines, who take the front lines, the Grey Knights are more about the mystical and faith-based sides of the Imperium. In battling back Chaos Space Marines and a mysterious disease known as the Bloom, the Grey Knights will need to update their base of operations, build new facilities, run research projects, and head into combat missions. 
Once Grey Knights are in the field, players will need to upgrade them into classes. There are four classes, and players can customize their armor and facial options to create their own special squad. Chaos Space Marines evolve as well, which escalates combat and forces players to focus on strategy.
The narrative is written by Black Library author Aaron Dembski-Bowden, so this should have some interesting lore for Warhammer fans.
Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters is currently planned to release on PC in 2022.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple is offering customers in India free AirPods with the purchase of an iPhone 12 or an iPhone 12 mini in celebration of the upcoming Diwali festival, which starts on November 4.





Apple's promotion will kick off on Thursday, October 7, and last year, it was highly popular with supplies selling out in just a couple of hours. According to Apple, the deal will be available from October 7 to November 4, though it's not clear how long supplies will hold up this year.



There is limited stock available on a per model basis, and Apple says that the promotion will only be available while stock lasts, so those in India hoping to take advantage of the deal should order early on October 7.



Customers in India can get the standard AirPods with Charging Case free with the promotion savings of INR 14900, or can pay extra to upgrade to the ‌AirPods‌ with Wireless Charging Case or the AirPods Pro. Pricing on the ‌iPhone 12‌ starts at INR 59900, but monthly payments are available, as are discounts with older device trade-ins.

A ‘no spoilers’ explanation of why you must play this masterpiece
 The introduction to Outer Wilds: Echoes of the Eye is Hall of Fame worthy, so comically hidden that players could complete the entirety of Outer Wilds without knowing they’d missed the entirety of its expansion. Once found, the reveal is unforgettable and worth the hour or more of head scratching required to find the proverbial front door. Its creators apparently agree; they managed to conceal the entirety of what the DLC is from its marketing campaign. I admire that choice while wondering if the ambiguity’s been detrimental to calling attention to this gem in an already crowded market.

Apple's website in France confirms the inclusion of EarPods with a Lightning connector with all iPhone 13 models sold in the country, as was the case with iPhone 12 models. To accommodate this, Apple ships the iPhones in two boxes in France, with the standard iPhone box placed inside a larger white box that contains the EarPods.  



Starting in October 2020, Apple stopped including EarPods and a charger in the box with all new iPhones that it sells. The company said omitting these accessories helps to reduce carbon emissions and avoids the mining and use of rare-earth elements. Apple added that many customers have switched to wireless headphones like AirPods. Outside of France, all new iPhones only include a Lightning to USB-C cable in the box.



Apple continues to sell EarPods separately, with pricing set at $19 in the United States.

More preseason hockey for your enjoyment.
 After a messy, drawn-out debut Tuesday, the Flyers are set to take on the Boston Bruins in another exhibition game. Want to know the story-lines and players to watch, or just looking to scratch your hockey itch? You’re in the right place.



The Bruins
Boston hasn’t iced many members of its main roster yet, opting to use Tuesday’s outing against the New York Rangers as a chance to break in some youngsters. In a 3-2 loss, the Bruins only featured four NHL regulars in their lineup (Tomas Nosek, Curtis Lazar, Mike Reilly, and Linus Ullmark) and still hung tough with a Rangers team playing significantly more of their established names (Artemi Panarin, Kappo Kakko, Jacob Trouba, Igor Shesterkin).

This design trend, well into its third or fourth year in the major publishing houses, has attracted plenty of nicknames and attendant discourse online — culture critic Jeva Lange calls it “blobs of suggestive colors,” while writer Alana Pockros calls it the “unicorn frappuccino cover,” and New Yorker writer Kyle Chayka once referred to it on Twitter as “the Zombie Formalism of book covers.”


I hadn’t really noticed this, but only because I thought these were all mostly the same book. Eep.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today updated its list of vintage and obsolete products to add the 38mm and 42mm Apple Watch models to the vintage list, marking the first time that the Apple Watch has been included.





The first Apple Watch was introduced more than six years ago in April 2015, with the "Series 1" replacement and Series 2 upgrade following in 2016. Apple has continued on updating the Apple Watch each year, and in 2021, we're expecting the Apple Watch Series 7 to see a release sometime in October.



The original 2015 Apple Watch now qualifies for Apple's "vintage" list, which includes devices that Apple stopped distributing for sale more than five years ago and less than seven years ago.



For most products, the vintage designation means that they're no longer eligible for repairs at the Genius Bar in Apple retail stores or from Apple Authorized Service Providers, but Apple does offer extended repairs of some vintage products and in locations where extended repairs are required by law.



In another couple of years, the original Apple Watch will move on to the obsolete list and hardware service will be entirely discontinued.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[iOS 15 adoption has reached an estimated 19.3% since the software update was released September 20, according to mobile analytics company Mixpanel.





Mixpanel measures iOS adoption based on visits to websites and apps that use its mobile analytics SDKs, so the data is not official. Apple has yet to share iOS 15 adoption stats, having last reported an 85% adoption rate for iOS 14 back in June.



iOS 15 adoption appears to remain slower than iOS 14 adoption so far, and there are likely several reasons for that, including Apple providing iOS 14 users with the option to continue receiving important security updates, several iOS 15 features being delayed, and iOS 15 suffering from a handful of early bugs that still need to be fixed.



For example, Apple said an issue preventing some iPhone 13 users from using the Unlock with Apple Watch feature will be fixed in an upcoming software update. The feature is designed to let you unlock your iPhone while wearing a mask, but some users have encountered an "Unable to Communicate with Apple Watch" error message.



There's another iOS 15 bug where performing an iCloud Backup can result in photos saved from an iMessage conversation that is later deleted to disappear from the Photos app, intermittent touchscreen issues on iPhone 13 models, and other problems.



Apple is currently beta testing iOS 15.1, which includes a fix for the Unlock with Apple Watch bug at a minimum, but there is no timeframe for the software update's release. It's quite possible that Apple will opt to release a smaller update such as iOS 15.0.1 to more quickly address some of the bugs and security vulnerabilities that have surfaced.

The Nenet reindeer herders need to move their tent every few days throughout most of the year. Every time they migrate they must pack the whole tent away, drag it across the tundra on sledges, and erect it again in a fresh place, sometimes in temperatures of minus thirty degrees. Survival depends on working together as a team.
After staying in the wooded taiga for two months they start to migrate north following the ancient paths of migrating reindeer (caribou). In four months they will travel up to 1200km and must pack and move every three to five days to keep up with their herd. They must reach their summer quarters before the snows melt and flood great rivers with icy waters too cold and deep for the calves, born along the way, to cross.

 A thumbprint stamped across the hazy driver’s side window of my 1985 Audi Sport Quattro, at the end of a race, says it all. In the impressively detailed and altogether delightful Hot Wheels Unleashed, launching Thursday, the cars feel like toys that actually have been played with, and like I’m the one doing the playing.
Previous Hot Wheels games (Unleashed is the 27th, by my count) have generally presented player and car at equivalent scale, through shrinking the viewer’s perspective into their world or making one of them life-size to ours.

Capcom also briefly mentioned some new monsters coming to Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak
 Capcom hosted a Monster Hunter stream on Thursday to offer a few new details on Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak — the upcoming expansion revealed during last week’s Nintendo Direct — and details around Rise’s long-awaited PC debut on Jan. 12, 2022.
Monster Hunter Rise is finally coming to PC after nearly a year of Switch exclusivity. The PC version will feature all of the patch content and monsters, but with 4K support, high-res textures, higher framerates, and optimized keyboard and mouse controls. It also supports ultra-wide displays. Players can download a demo for the PC version on Oct. 13.
In terms of Sunbreak, Capcom revealed that Malzeno is the new elder dragon and flagship monster who appears heavily in the expansion’s trailer. There is also a new castle ruins location — which also features in the reveal — where the sky turns red. Shogun Ceanataur is also coming to Sunbreak, a returning monster that first appeared in Monster Hunter 2. Those are the only two monster Capcom was able to talk about on Thursday’s stream, but the studio revealed that more old monsters will return with Sunbreak’s release next summer.]]></summary>

Rumored remaster to include GTA 3, Vice City, and San Andreas for modern platforms
 A new rating for Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition appears to verify reports that a remaster of the original PlayStation 2 and Xbox-era trilogy is coming to modern platforms. 
Korea’s Game Rating and Administration Committee, generally a reputable indicator of releases, recently published a rating for Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition for unspecified platforms from publisher Take-Two Interactive. Take-Two has not announced the Definitive Edition release, but the publisher said in August that it has three “new iterations of previously released titles,” which it describes as “ports and remastered titles,” in its pipeline.
A remaster of the trilogy — Grand Theft Auto 3, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas — has long been rumored. A report from Kotaku in August, citing sources, said that the three games are being remastered in Unreal Engine with a mix of new and old graphics, as well as an updated (but still classic) user interface.
A Rockstar Games spokesperson did not provide comment on the rating when contacted by Polygon.
Rockstar Games already publishes those Grand Theft Auto games under the title Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy for other platforms, according to listings on the PlayStation Store for PlayStation 4 and Steam for Windows PC.]]></summary>

More than a few shadows hang over this faithful remaster
 With Diablo 2: Resurrected, developer Vicarious Visions had the unenviable task of releasing a game published by Activision Blizzard. 
Beginning in July,  a storm of controversy has raged around the publisher, which has faced several lawsuits alleging toxic workplace environments, a “pervasive frat boy culture,” and discrimination against women, one of which was instituted by a federal agency and ended with a recent settlement. Vicarious Visions released its creation into an environment engulfed in cynicism and anger at its affiliate publisher, and the creator of the original game. Longtime players have stopped participating in the Activision Blizzard ecosystem; high ranking employees have lef…]]></summary>

The Flyers signed Derick Brassard late in the offseason, but he could become a key addition with Kevin Hayes out.
 When the Flyers signed Derick Brassard just over a month ago, he was viewed as nothing more than a depth piece. Perhaps a safety net in the bottom six. Now, after the injury to Kevin Hayes (and less so Wade Allison), Brassard is looking more and more like a necessary signing.
The 34-year-old forward had the best years of his career with the New York Rangers under Alain Vigneault. From 2013 to 2016, Brassard missed just five regular-season games. He recorded 163 points (64 goals, 99 assists) in 241 games for the Blueshirts. In recent years, Brassard has become more of a defensive-minded center with his play-driving taking a dip.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple now lets users rate and review pre-installed iPhone apps on the App Store, such as Maps, Podcasts, Mail, and others, bringing the company's apps to parity with how users criticize and/or laud third-party apps on the platform.





Spotted first by 9to5Mac, Apple now lets users leave a zero to five-star rating for a number of its pre-installed apps, further enabling users to write their reviews. At the time of writing, the Podcasts app, which has faced a flurry of criticism, has a 2 out of 5-star rating out of 156 reviews, with other Apple apps varying.



Presently, no Apple app has a perfect five-star rating, with even the company's built-in Stocks app struggling to reach a 4 out of 5 grade. Notes has earned just 3.6 out of 5, while even Maps, which has received more attention from Apple over the years, has only a 3 out of 5 ratings.



By opening up its apps to ratings and reviews, Apple and its teams are now better able to receive more direct feedback for individual apps on ‌‌iPhone‌‌ and iPad. In light of recent ‌App Store‌ litigation, this move also nixes a potential criticism from Apple's detractors, who could have previously argued that by withholding ratings and reviews for pre-installed apps, Apple was being anti-competitive.



Apple's pre-installed apps, such as Mail, Podcasts, and Maps, don't receive regular ‌App Store‌ feature updates as other apps do; instead, their major updates are bundled with significant iOS releases.



Apple refines and tweaks all of its apps with each minor update for iOS and iPadOS, but significant changes, such as the ones that are likely to be requested through ratings and reviews, are not expected to come sporadically throughout the year, but instead, users will have to wait for the next major iOS release to see if their wishes have come true.

Express Transit is an ‌Apple Pay‌ feature that allows for tap-and-go payment at ticket barriers, eliminating the need to authenticate with Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode. The device does not need to be wakened or unlocked to use Express Transit.



Computer Science researchers from Birmingham and Surrey Universities demonstrated to the BBC how the attack works by exploiting a weakness in the Visa contactless system through the use of a small piece of commercially available radio equipment, which is placed near the phone and masquerades as a ticket barrier.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo:
A news report on Sept. 30, 2021 (JST) falsely claims that Nintendo
is supplying tools to drive game development for a Nintendo Switch
with 4K support. To ensure correct understanding among our
investors and customers, we want to clarify that this report is
not true.
We also want to restate that, as we announced in July, we have no
plans for any new model other than Nintendo Switch — OLED Model,
which will launch on October 8, 2021.
What news report? This news report, from Bloomberg reporters Takashi Mochizuki and Olga Kharif. Quite the strident denial. It’s certainly possible Nintendo is lying here, or stretching the truth to the point of absurdity (like, say, if they supplied 4K Switch development tools in the past, but are not “supplying” them now).
We should know the answer soon — if Bloomberg’s report is simply wrong, I’m sure they’ll promptly issue a correction and retraction.
(“Big Hack” snark aside, here’s a theory that adds up: third-party developers are working on games for a 4K-capable Nintendo gaming console, which console is probably Switch-like and will play Switch games, including updated 4K versions of existing Switch games, but that new console (a) is not imminent, and Nintendo doesn’t want to Osborne the actually imminent Switch OLED in the meantime, and (b) will not be called a “Switch”.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jason Snell, Six Colors:
The problem is that most people don’t buy a new iPhone every year.
The primary upgraders to the iPhone 13 will be coming from the
iPhone 7, or 8, or X, or XS, or XR. For them, several years of
Apple innovations will be rolled into a single purchase. But
reviews of the new iPhones will not address what happened in 2018,
or 2019, or 2020.
Here’s an attempt to provide a little more of a big-picture
overview for owners of older iPhones who are wondering what’s new
in the iPhone 13. I’ve simplified matter a little — if you own a
“plus” or “max” model of iPhone, obviously your phone will be a
little larger, and you may want to consider the direct upgrade to
the iPhone 13 Pro Max to continue with your large phone. The
iPhone 13 mini is also a great option for those who prefer a
smaller phone with all the same power as the larger iPhone 13.
This is a fantastic idea. You just scroll down to whatever iPhone you’re currently using, and boom, there’s a list of the top upgrades you’d experience if you upgrade to an iPhone 13. Apple’s excellent iPhone Compare page has all this information, but the Compare page also tells you everything that’s the same or roughly equivalent between models. Snell’s guide focuses on the big changes from iPhone Old and iPhone New.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This video highlights one of the ways in which the Netherlands makes their streets safer for pedestrians: continuous sidewalks. Instead of sidewalks ending at the curb and picking up on the other side of the street, many sidewalks in Dutch cities continue across roadways, at the same height and using different surface materials, forcing cars to slow and signaling to drivers to be alert for pedestrians.
It’s hard to describe how much nicer it is to walk in an environment like this. It feels like the people walking are in control and that drivers are a guest in their environment, not the other way around.

Some new iPad mini 6 owners have noticed that text or images on one side of the screen appear to be tilted downward when scrolling through content, which affects all LCD screens but is particularly noticeable on the ‌iPad mini‌.



According to iFixit, jelly scrolling usually isn't as prominent as it is on Apple's new 8.3-inch tablet, and it's caused by the way the screen refreshes. The screen refreshes from one side to another, in a wave-like pattern, rather than all at once. On the ‌iPad mini‌, iFixit speculates that the direction the screen is scanni…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai, reporting for Motherboard:
On Thursday, a security researcher published details of three
iPhone vulnerabilities that are unpatched as of today. The
security researcher, whose name is Denis Tokarev, said he decided
to publish the bugs’ details as well as the source code that makes
it extremely easy to reproduce and exploit them, because he was
tired of waiting and felt like Apple ignored him.
Tokarev reported the vulnerabilities to Apple between March 10 and
April 29, but the last time he heard back from Apple about the
three vulnerabilities was August 6, August 12, and August 25,
respectively. Then the researcher said he told Apple on September
13 he would publish details of the bugs unless he heard back.
It was only after he went public with details about the unpatched
bugs that Apple reached out, according to Tokarev, who shared
Apple’s email with Motherboard.
“We saw your blog post regarding this issue and your other
reports. We apologize for the delay in responding to you,” an
Apple employee wrote. “We want to let you know that we are still
investigating these issues and how we can address them to protect
customers. Thank you again for taking the time to report these
issues to us, we appreciate your assistance. Please let us know if
you have any questions.”
Tokarev, in his follow-up post:
Indeed, I do have questions.

YouTube is taking down several video channels associated with
high-profile anti-vaccine activists including Joseph Mercola and
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who experts say are partially responsible
for helping seed the skepticism that’s contributed to slowing
vaccination rates across the country.
As part of a new set of policies aimed at cutting down on
anti-vaccine content on the Google-owned site, YouTube will ban
any videos that claim that commonly used vaccines approved by
health authorities are ineffective or dangerous. The company
previously blocked videos that made those claims about coronavirus
vaccines, but not ones for other vaccines like those for measles
or chickenpox.
Misinformation researchers have for years said the popularity of
anti-vaccine content on YouTube was contributing to growing
skepticism of lifesaving vaccines in the United States and around
the world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[iOS 15 was released last week with a long list of new features, but there is one change that is proving to be an annoyance to users.





On the Apple TV, users who prefer not to input text using the Siri Remote can use a nearby iPhone or iPad to type. Whenever a text field appears on the Apple TV, a notification appears on the iPhone or iPad, and after tapping the notification, users can use the on-screen keyboard on the iPhone or iPad to enter text on the Apple TV.



The issue is that iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 no longer offer a way to disable the Apple TV keyboard notifications, despite Apple advertising this option in its tvOS 15 User Guide. On devices running iOS 14 and iPadOS 14, there was a toggle switch for turning off the notifications in Settings > Notifications > Apple TV Keyboard.



The inability to turn off the Apple TV keyboard notifications has prompted complaints from users. We've reached out to Apple to see if the company will consider reintroducing the toggle switch in a future software update, and we'll update this story if we hear back.

Squid Game is a new Korean thriller on Netflix that hit the streaming service on Sept. 17. Since then, it’s become a viral hit; it’s the most-watched show on Netflix in the United States, and it’s currently on track to become its most-watched show of all time worldwide, according to Netflix.

Inspired by hermit crabs, we designed a modular system for table-top wheeled robots to dock to passive attachment modules, defined as “mechanical shells.” Different types of mechanical shells can uniquely extend and convert the motion of robots with embedded mechanisms, so that, as a whole architecture, the system can offer a variety of interactive functionality by self-reconfiguration.

A depth option for the Flyers will have to go under the knife.
 The Philadelphia Flyers will be without one of their safety nets at forward this season, as head coach Alain Vigneault announced on Wednesday that center Tanner Laczynski will be out for the entirety of the 2021-22 season.
This unfortunately isn’t anything new for the 24-year-old, as just last season he had to undergo hip surgery to repair a torn labrum in April, cutting that campaign short. Now just five months later — one month out of his recovery timeline — he has injured the opposite hip and needs another surgery, ending his entire season and will hold him away from a professional hockey game for over 17 months. This dude just cannot catch a break.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Image: Amazon Game Studios
    

  
The MMO has hundreds of thousands of players and massive queue times
 Amazon’s MMO New World was finally released on Tuesday after months of testing and delays, but it’s already a little too popular for its servers. This has led to long queues as players try to log into the game.
During its official launch day of Sept. 28, New World peaked at number two on Steam with a player count of just over 700,000. This massive player count is good news for Amazon, but the game’s servers apparently weren’t up to the task. The game has over 26,000 Steam reviews, and most of them — which Steam labels as Mixed, with just 48% skewing positive at the time of writing — complain about the game’s massive queues and limited server capacity. 
Of course, Amazon Game Studios is more than aware of New World’s problem. In a launch day update post on the game’s website, the developer explained that its short-term goal is setting up new servers and working to expand the capacity of the ones that are already online, in order to help everyone log in and play as soon as possible. 
Amazon Game Studios also has a long-term plan to let players transfer their characters to an entirely new server for free in the next two weeks. This should help balance the load so that certain overpopulated servers aren’t too stressed, while lower-population servers — with lower queue times — should get a boost in players to even things out.
While all of these plans should help reduce the queue times in the future for New World, it’s likely that players will still have to deal with a wait to log in for the next few days, especially on more populated servers. But as Amazon rolls out its solutions, and the hype eventually dies down a bit, players should hopefully be able to get into Aeternum a little more quickly.]]></summary>

        <updated>2021-09-29T16:43:50.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite not being advertised by Apple, the iPhone 13 Pro Max is capable of faster charging at up to 27W speeds when connected to a 30W or higher USB-C power adapter, according to testing conducted by ChargerLAB. For comparison, the iPhone 12 Pro Max is capable of charging at up to around 21W to 22W speeds with an equivalent power adapter.





It's worth noting that the iPhone 13 Pro Max does not sustain peak 27W power for the entire charging cycle due to heat considerations, but the device should still charge slightly faster than the iPhone 12 Pro Max overall.






It's unclear if the smaller iPhone 13 Pro is also capable of charging at up to 27W speeds — we've asked ChargerLAB and we'll update this story if we hear back. The standard iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini are limited to roughly the same charging speeds as the equivalent iPhone 12 models, according to a user on Chinese social media platform Weibo.



Apple no longer includes a charger in the box with new iPhones, but it does sell a 30W USB-C power adapter for $49 for users who want to charge their iPhone 13 Pro Max as quickly as possible in light of this discovery.



Update: ChargerLAB has informed MacRumors that the smaller iPhone 13 Pro achieved max charging speeds of 23W in its testing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ed Yong: We’re Already Barreling Toward the Next Pandemic. The US is throwing too little money at high-tech, ultimately private sector solutions but much of the problem comes down to our underfunded public health system and “profoundly unequal society”.
“To be ready for the next pandemic, we need to make sure that there’s an even footing in our societal structures,” Seema Mohapatra, a health-law expert at Indiana University, told me. That vision of preparedness is closer to what 19th-century thinkers lobbied for, and what the 20th century swept aside. It means shifting the spotlight away from pathogens themselves and onto the living and working conditions that allow pathogens to flourish. It means measuring preparedness not just in terms of syringes, sequencers, and supply chains but also in terms of paid sick leave, safe public housing, eviction moratoriums, decarceration, food assistance, and universal health care. It means accompanying mandates for social distancing and the like with financial assistance for those who might lose work, or free accommodation where exposed people can quarantine from their family. It means rebuilding the health policies that Reagan began shredding in the 1980s and that later administrations further frayed. It means restoring trust in government and community through public services. “It’s very hard to achieve effective containment when the people you’re working with don’t think you care about them,” Arrianna Marie Planey, a medical geographer at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, told me.

Pro players become Champions in an all-out international brawl
 The 2021 League of Legends World Championship is about to begin, but first, Riot is kicking off the event with another new song and animated video featuring many of the world’s best pro players. This time around the track is called “Burn it All Down” by the synth-pop band Pvris, while the video was created by Haoliners Animation. 
The new video features several current and former League of Legends stars battling it out and transforming into some of their signature champions. Lee “Faker” Sang-hyeok, one of League’s most famous players and most frequent world champion, returns for this video, which is particularly fitting since he’s back on the Worlds’ stage this year after missing out in 2020. The video also features players like last year’s Worlds’ MVP Kim “Canyon” Geon-bu, and former-world champions Kim “DoinB” Tae-sang, who is one of the top players heading into the tournament this year. 
Riot releases a new Worlds theme song every year, generally partnering with new artists each time. In 2014 Imagine Dragons wrote the song Warriors for the event, while Zedd, who worked with Riot on creating weapon skins in Valorant earlier this year, wrote Ignite for Worlds 2016. This is the first time that Riot has worked with Pvris. Meanwhile Chinese animation studio Haoliners Animation had worked with Riot on several projects before partnering for this video. 
The 2021 League of Legends World Championship will begin with its preliminary play-in stage on Oct. 5 in Reykjavík, Iceland. The tournament’s Grand Finals will be held on Nov. 6, the same day that Riot will premiere the first episodes of its Netflix animated series Arcane.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Facebook today announced that it's bringing Reels, its short-form videos that were previously only available on the Instagram platform, to its main Facebook app on iOS and Android in the United States. 





While the two share the same name and style, Reels content on Instagram and Facebook will differ. Facebook says it is testing the ability for Instagram Reels content creators to share their Reels to the Facebook audience, but doing so is entirely in a creator's control. Reels on Facebook can consist of effects, text, music, and more. Facebook's concept of Reels is wholly inspired by TikTok and follows its lead in featuring short, "entertaining," and trend-making videos. 
With the ability to create reels and have their Instagram reels suggested to people on Facebook, creators — whether they’re just starting out or already have a large following — will have more ways to express themselves, grow their communities and reach new audiences.



Reels on Facebook can consist of music, audio, effects, and more. You can find them in News Feed or in Groups, and when viewing a reel on Facebook, you can easily follow the creator directly from the video, like and comment on it, or share it with friends.
Facebook also today announced it would be offering a new bonus program for content creators in hopes of spurring-up more Reels content on its platform. Reels in Facebook will be available starting today in the United States on iOS and Android.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple and Google have been asked to provide compliance plans for a newly amended law in South Korea that bars both tech giants from forcing developers to using their in-app purchase payment system for their respective app distribution platforms, Reuters reports.





In August, South Korea passed an amendment to an existing law that bans Apple and Google from mandating developers to use their own proprietary in-app purchasing system. Apple's in-app purchasing system gives the company a 15 to 30% commission for all purchases made and has been a hot topic for Apple and the discussion around the App Store for some time. Under the new law in South Korea, which is yet to go into effect, Apple and Google will be required to allow developers to use third-party payment methods within their app. 



Apple has in recent weeks made some concessions to its ‌App Store‌ policy, most notably pivoting to allow developers to add links in their apps to external websites where purchases can be made. Those concessions come short of the mandate created by South Korea, which permits developers to add third-party payment methods directly within their app. 



Apple has continued to call its in-app purchasing system the most trusted and safest way for customers to make purchases. Still, in light of recent decisions in its lawsuit against Epic Games, the Cupertino tech giant is being forced to rethink its model. 



Apple operates the ‌App Store‌ under a single set of policies worldwide, and while the law passed in South Korea pertains to South Korean users, it will undoubtedly play a domino effect across the globe. With the mid-October deadline now set in South Korea for Apple and Google, we'll likely see how this decision could have repercussions around the world for Apple users soon.

Let’s talk standouts!
 We’re back, folks! Hockey is back and the Flyers kicked off the preseason in perhaps the most Flyers way possible—with an exciting comeback to tie the game and a prompt loss in overtime—last night against the Islanders.

 *What an extraordinarily Flyers way to ring in a new season, huh?? In all seriousness, it was fun to see the boys back on the ice, see some kids score some goals, and let the cobwebs start to shake off before things count. RECAP!
*After last night’s look at some players we can probably expect another round of roster cuts coming soon. [NBC Sports Philly]
*Anyhoo, Charlie’s got a full-on season preview with some help from his pals over at The Athletic. [The Athletic]
*It was very fun to get our first look at the new guys last night, since those are the guys that we’re going to need to bring this team back to what we know it can be. [ProHockeyTalk]
*Back to guys who probably won’t be making the team out of the gate, Tyson Foerster. Kid’s got a filthy shot. [Inquirer]
*So uh... the Devils have a little situation on their hands. [ESPN]
*Wayne Simmonds continues to be the absolute best, even all the way up in Toronto. No shocks there. [Sportsnet]
*It would appear that the NHL has finally learned that playing an outdoor game in the sunshine just doesn’t work. [NHL.com]
*And finally, DGB’s got 22 players to watch as this season kicks off and you’ll be shocked to learn there is a Flyers on it. [The Athletic]]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple's latest developer beta of macOS Monterey contains references to a "High Power Mode" that could boost performance when a MacBook isn't connected to a power adapter. 





The reference, spotted by 9to5Mac, harks back to a similar so-called "Pro Mode" that was found in a developer beta of macOS Catalina 10.15.3 back in January 2020. 



"Pro Mode" was referred to in the code as making apps run faster at the expense of consuming more battery and increasing fan noise, but the feature never made it to the public Catalina release and references to such a mode were absent in Monterey until beta 8, which was released on Tuesday.



"High Power Mode" isn't available to users, and beyond the name appearing in code, nothing is known about the referenced feature, although a "Low Power Mode" already exists in ‌macOS Monterey‌ that reduces performance in MacBooks to conserve battery life, so presumably "High Power Mode" will operate at the other extreme and let users run apps and hardware at maximum performance when not connected to power.



It's unclear whether Apple will announce "High Power Mode" as an upcoming feature in ‌macOS Monterey‌. Likewise, there's no way of knowing if the feature would be available on all Macs or be exclusive to certain models, such as the upcoming 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models rumored to drop this fall. Apple is expected to release ‌macOS Monterey‌ in the next few weeks.

The project was stopped due to either the single stack structure of OLED panel or profitability issues or both, people familiar with the matter said.
Single stack refers to the current widely used OLED panel structure where red, green and blue form one emission layer. 



Apple is reportedly not satisfied with the brightness levels of single stack OLED panels and is also wary of the panel's lifespan, since consumers typically hold onto iPads for longer compared to smartphones, which have a more aggressive upgrade cycle. 



Instead, Apple wants to use a two-stack tandem structure for its first OLED iP…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple's 96W USB-C power adapter that is designed for use with the 16-inch MacBook Pro currently faces a lengthy 2-3 months shipping estimate on the company's online store in the United States and many other countries. The adapter is also listed as unavailable for in-store pickup at most Apple retail stores around the world.





In some countries like Japan, the 2-3 months shipping estimate began showing up in August, and the delay has since extended to more countries. 



While redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models are rumored to launch later this year, many tech companies are facing supply constraints due to a global chip shortage, so the reason for the 96W power adapter's shipping delay is ultimately unclear.



Apple has included the 96W power adapter with the 16-inch MacBook Pro since the notebook launched in November 2019, and it is also sold separately for $79, albeit now with the lengthy shipping delay. The previous-generation 15-inch MacBook Pro was bundled with an 87W power adapter, which Apple has since discontinued.



Apple's smaller 20W, 30W, and 61W power adapters are currently not facing any extended shipping delays in the United States.



A source at an Apple Authorized Reseller informed MacRumors that their distributors currently do not have any stock of the 96W power adapter, suggesting that the power adapter is facing significant supply constraints across multiple channels.



Apple is widely rumored to be planning redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with a faster version of the M1 chip and brighter mini-LED displays. Rumors suggest the notebooks will return to a design with an HDMI port and SD card reader, a magnetic power cable, and physical function keys instead of the Touch Bar.

Not the outcome you’d like, but not half bad either.
 Flyers hockey is officially back. The Orange & Black opened up the preseason tonight with a match in the Wells Fargo Center against Barry Trotz and the hated Islanders. What were the storylines, who stood out, and what unreasonably hyperbolic conclusions can we draw from the 60 minutes of play we witnessed? All of that and more below.
What went right?
The Flyers had some strong individual player performances tonight, even if they ebbed and flowed in terms of team success. Derick Brassard, Ryan Ellis, Oskar Lindblom, and Yegor Zamula particularly stood out as positives, although that’s not saying that guys like Sean Couturier, Claude Giroux, or Keith Yandle didn’t impress either.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Local note, quite possibly of interest to non-locals as well: I’ll be on stage this Thursday afternoon at 2 pm for the B. PHL Innovation Fest, in a chat with Youngmoo Kim, director of Drexel’s ExCITe Center. It’ll be him, interviewing me, about the stuff I do and have done. I’ve known Youngmoo for a few years — this will be good. In-person attendance has been scrapped because of COVID-19 (they haven’t updated the website to make this clear), but virtual attendance registration is open and is now free of charge.
Good lineup of keynote speakers too, including Don Lemon and Sixers president Daryl Morey. (If I see him backstage, I’ll try to get the scoop on Ben Simmons.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today updated its investor relations page to announce that it will share its earnings results for the fourth fiscal quarter (third calendar quarter) of 2021 on Thursday, October 28.





The fourth quarter earnings call will provide some insight into the early sales of the new iPhone 13 models and the new iPad options, giving us our first hints into how 2021 sales compared with 2020 sales.



Apple again declined to provide guidance for the fourth quarter of 2021 during its third quarter earnings call due to the ongoing global health crisis, which is continuing to cause uncertainty for product launch timelines and sales.



Apple in the third quarter brought in $81.4 billion in revenue, marking a new June quarter record thanks to strong sales of the iPhone, ‌iPad‌, and Mac.



The quarterly earnings statement will be released at 1:30 PM Pacific/4:30 PM Eastern, with a conference call to discuss the report taking place at 2:00 PM Pacific/5:00 PM Eastern. MacRumors will provide coverage of both the earnings release and conference call on October 29.

Oxenfree 2 still on the way
 Netflix has acquired Oxenfree developer Night School Studio, the companies announced Tuesday. The game studio, known for its branching narratives, will create original games for the streaming platform’s nascent foray into video games.
Night School Studio founder Sean Krankel said in a blog post about the acquisition that the company will continue working on Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals, which it currently expects to launch in early 2022 on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC. As the first games studio to join Netflix on this new project, said Krankel, Night School wants to “stretch [its] narrative and design aspirations across distinctive, original games with heart.”

God fucking dammit Kris where the fuck are we
 Undertale spawned a following that turned it into a cultural touchstone for an entire generation of gamers. So when its creator, Toby Fox, released a new chapter of his Undertale spinoff, Deltarune, there was no surprise that this new section of the game would inspire players to create art and write fanfiction. Fans are now filling Twitter, Reddit, and YouTube with Deltarune Chapter 2 memes starring two of the game’s main characters, Kris and Susie. 
Deltarune is a spinoff of Undertale. The entire game isn’t out yet — Fox split it into chapters, and released the first one in 2018. In September, he announced a surprise release of the second chapter via an anniversary stream for Undertale, and has since said that he will…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last April, after posting this photo of my desk setup for my iPad Air review, I got a few questions about the stand I was using to prop up the iPad. The answer was Anker’s $15 Multi-Angle Stand. Last week I posted a similar photo, this time for my iPad Mini review, and I’m still using the same stand. Alas, that stand is no longer available.
The closest thing I could find is this $10 copy of that stand from Amazon Basics. It’s such a blatant rip-off of Anker’s stand that ordinarily I wouldn’t link to it, on principle, but, given that Anker’s original is seemingly no longer being produced, a rip-off design is the best we can do. I even bought one to try it out before linking to it. (If you buy one through this link, I’ll earn affiliate revenue that will get me one step closer to buying one of the upcoming Jony Ive/Marc Newson-designed electric Ferraris.)
Amazon’s multi-angle stand is extremely similar to Anker’s in size, weight, and angles of tilt. But it’s slightly lacking in fit and finish compared to Anker’s. Whereas Anker’s felt like a bargain at $15, this one feels like what you’d expect from a $10 knock-off. My biggest annoyance is that Amazon, for some reason, decided to screen print “Press/Presse” on the button that you quite obviously must press to adjust the tilt. (Why French?) This is as helpful as printing “Press” on the knock of a click pen. And of course they typeset these needless words in Arial. A wee nip of nail polish remover took care of that, though.
I still recommend it. It folds flat, and when your iPad is sitting in it, the stand effectively disappears.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Katie Deighton, reporting for The Wall Street Journal:
Ferrari NV hired Apple Inc.’s former design chief Jony Ive as it
readies its debut into full electric vehicles.
Mr. Ive’s design company LoveFrom Inc., which he formed in 2019
alongside industrial designer Marc Newson, will work with Ferrari
and its largest shareholder, Netherlands-based Exor NV on a number
of projects, the companies said Monday. […]
Ferrari declined to reveal the specifics of the collaboration, but
said it sees potential in working with LoveFrom across the whole
range of its business. Alongside its legacy production of its
engine-powered cars, the company sells clothes, watches and other
apparel.
If they wind up shipping a car through this collaboration, it might not cost that much more than the scrapped first draft Apple Car under Ive, which I’ve heard — admittedly like fourth-hand — would have started at $150,000. (Which is one of many reasons the project was rebooted.)
Cabel Sasser (click through for photos):
(Actually, Marc Newson’s Ford 021C concept was my dream car right
around 2000. It’s the perfect encapsulation of the style of that
time, a Deee-Lite/CD-ROM/Dreamcast/iMac/Virgin Megastore car. I
still want one today!!! But the Fun Design Train now only stops at
Luxury Station ☹️)
Newson’s concept car was indeed delightful — real-world car-from-Pixar’s Cars vibe to it.

With an 8.3-inch display, the ‌iPad mini‌ has a bigger screen size than ever before, but it's actually a touch less tall than the prior-generation version thanks to much slimmer bezels and the removal of the Home button.

Hey worst case, they can’t be as bad as the Eagles were last night.
 


It’s been a short, yet at the same time long off-season, but tonight the Philadelphia Flyers will hit the ice and play a preseason hockey game. A lot has changed since the Orange & Black finished their 2020-21 season with a win over the New Jersey Devils on May 10, and tonight we get our first look at the new-look Flyers. 



At bare minimum what we cannot say about this team heading into the season is: this is the same ol’ Flyers. Jakub Voracek had been here since 2011, he’s out. Shayne Gostisbehere since 2015, he’s out. Nolan Patrick was the second overall pick a little over four years ago, he’s out. But in are an exciting group of players that it feels like Philly…]]></summary>

"Jelly scrolling" refers to screen tearing, which can cause text or images on one side of the screen to appear to be tilted downwards because of a mismatch in refresh rates. It can cause one side of the display to look as if it's responding faster than the other side, a visual disturbance that's hard to miss once you notice it.



Apple told Ars Technica that jelly scroll is normal behavior for an LCD. The screen is designed to refresh line by line, which can cause a tiny delay between when the lines at the top of the screen and the bottom of the screen are refre…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the second beta of iOS 15.1 to developers, and the update includes a fix for an annoying bug that's been affecting iPhone 13 owners who also have an Apple Watch.





With beta 2, the Unlock with Apple Watch feature that was broken has been fixed, and an authenticated Apple Watch can once again be used to unlock an ‌iPhone 13‌ model when wearing a mask. 



Prior to the update, attempting to enable the Unlock with Apple Watch feature under Settings > Face ID & Passcode would result in an error that said the iPhone was unable to communicate with the Apple Watch. That error message has now been addressed, and the feature can be successfully toggled on after updating to iOS 15.1 beta 2. 



Apple in a support document promised that a fix for the issue would be coming in a future update, and it appears that update may be iOS 15.1. It's not clear if we'll also see an iOS 15.0.1 update that has a fix, as it could still be several weeks before iOS 15.1 sees a public release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DisplayMate today awarded the iPhone 13 Pro Max with its "Best Smartphone Display Award." The device earned the company's highest-ever display performance grade of A+ and set or matched 12 of its smartphone display performance records.





iPhone 13 Pro models feature a new Super Retina XDR display with ProMotion, which is Apple's branding for a variable refresh rate between 10Hz and 120Hz. This technology allows the display to refresh from a power-preserving 10 times per second to an ultra smooth 120 times per second depending on the type of content that is on the screen.



One of the records that the iPhone 13 Pro Max set was highest full-screen brightness for smartphones with OLED displays, according to DisplayMate's in-depth analysis. Apple says the iPhone 13 Pro Max has a max brightness of 1,000 nits for typical content and 1,200 nits for HDR content. By comparison, the iPhone 12 Pro Max has a max brightness of 800 nits for typical content and 1,200 nits for HDR content.



Other records set or matched by the iPhone 13 Pro Max include highest absolute color accuracy, highest contrast ratio, lowest screen reflectance, and more.



Samsung is the exclusive supplier of the LTPO OLED panels used for the iPhone 13 Pro Max, according to Display Supply Chain Consultants, but LG is reportedly aiming to begin supplying Apple with LTPO OLED panels as early as next year.



DisplayMate extensively tested the iPhone 13 Pro Max's display, so make sure to read the full analysis for more details.

Developers can download the new tvOS 15 beta by downloading a profile onto the ‌Apple TV‌ using Xcode.



Other than new releases, tvOS updates are often minor in scale, focusing on under-the-hood bug fixes and improvements rather than major outward-facing changes. We don't yet know what's included in tvOS 15.1, but we'll update this article should anything be found.



Though we don't often know what's new in tvOS during the beta testing process, we let MacRumors readers know when new updates are available so those who are developers can download it upon release.

The space puzzler’s Echoes of the Eye DLC encouraged me to revisit the modern classic
 I first played Outer Wilds in 2019, when the game was initially released. I marveled at the galaxy’s beautiful planets, playing as a Hearthian alien on my first space expedition. The trip would take me away from my home of Timber Hearth and across the cosmos, exploring archaeological ruins, and sussing out the civilization that left them behind. The game was, put simply, stunning.
But Outer Wilds was also incredibly difficult. Navigating the ship required controlling six thrusters, and charting a course that would let me land on orbiting celestial bodies. The game’s time loop proved to be the ultimate challenge, throwing me back into my starting place …]]></summary>

Players who have pre-ordered the game will get to play for two extra days
 Battlefield 2042 is delayed until November, but its beta is still ready for the near future. The beta will run from Oct. 6-9, Electronic Arts and developer DICE announced on Tuesday. 
The open beta will include Battlefield’s signature Conquest mode, but with a slight twist: Two teams will compete to control several flags in certain areas, rather than larger individual control points. The beta will feature the game’s Orbital map, which takes the fight to an active rocket launch site. During the beta, players can choose to play as one of four different specialists, who each more or less represent a traditional Battlefield class and have their own abilities. 
Battlefield 2042 players who have pre-ordered the game will get access to the beta starting on Oct. 6 for an exclusive two-day early access period. The beta will open up for all players starting on Oct. 8. The beta will be available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. PlayStation Plus is not required to participate in the open beta, but if you plan to play on Xbox, you will need an active Xbox Live Gold subscription.
DICE and EA also announced the PC system requirements for the beta, which you can find below:

Meet Mikaela Reid
 Dead by Daylight is a scary game, so it’s appropriate we’re getting an update on the game’s next character as we head into October and towards Halloween. The next content update for Dead by Daylight is Hour of the Witch, and it includes a new Survivor named Mikaela Reid.
We didn’t get a look at Mikaela’s exclusive perks, which change the way each Survivor plays. However, Survivors tend to be much squishier and more vulnerable than Killers, and have very little, if anything, in the way of offensive capabilities. It seems that Mikaela may be able to use her witchy ways to help the team in a support capability, as a tweet by developer Behaviour Interactive reads “She brings light and life to a realm of darkness and death.”
She brings light and life to a realm of darkness and death.  
A new Survivor is coming to Dead by Daylight… pic.twitter.com/owFWDDLYrD
— Dead by Daylight (@DeadByBHVR) September 28, 2021



It makes sense to get a new Survivor, as the last addition to the game was Pinhead. The Hellraiser update only contained a Killer. Usually these updates also have a complementary Survivor. While Pinhead is a licensed character, Mikaela appears to be totally original to Dead by Daylight, and she’ll likely have some sort of story that explains how she ended up in the Fog.]]></summary>

Townsend revealed that Apple starts planning future iPhone camera systems about three years in advance of public availability, suggesting that the company began developing the camera systems on the iPhone 13 models as early as 2018.
"The planning has to start about three years ahead, because that's when we actually fix the specification of the silicon," says Townsend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a new blog post titled "Bring the best of Google to your iPhone," Google is on an endeavor to convince new iPhone 13 users to transform their ‌device’s home screen to look like Android.





The blog post, written by Google's director for the iOS platform, features screenshots of an ‌iPhone 13‌ home screen filled with Google apps and widgets. The post implies that customers should possibly consider replacing some of Apple's default iOS apps, such as Photos, Safari, Calendar, Reminders, and even Phone, with Google's equivalent of those apps, including Google ‌Photos‌, Google Chrome, Google Calendar, Google Tasks, and Google Voice, respectively.



Google continued to encourage customers to utilize the wide variety of ‌widgets‌ its iOS apps offer. Google said that if the right Google ‌widgets‌ are placed on the home screen, users will "never even have to leave" their home screens to stay caught up.



According to the blog post, users can also use "Smart Stacks" to stack different Google ‌widgets‌ on top of each other, allowing iOS to determine which widget is most relevant to show at any one time. 



Finally, Google recommends that users replace Safari with Google Chrome as the default iOS browser, allowing all system-wide links and Spotlight web suggestions to open in Chrome. Google closed by saying it hopes ‌iPhone 13‌ users, who just started receiving their new iPhones last week, will consider bringing "the best of Google" to their device instead of just simply purchasing an Android smartphone or device.

        <updated>2021-09-27T22:58:08.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today increased the price of its Beats Flex headphones from $49.99 to $69.99, a pricing shift that may be related to supply chain constraints that have raised the costs of components across the industry.





First released last October, the Beats Flex made headlines at launch because of their low price compared to other Apple headphone options, and they have been a popular purchase option since. The Beats Flex are a follow-up to the BeatsX, and feature an in-ear design with a wire between the left and right earbuds.



Given their low price, the Beats Flex may have been more susceptible to cost pressures than some other Apple products. At $20 more expensive, the Beats Flex are still a very affordable option to get into the Apple headphone ecosystem, but it's not quite as impressive a deal as before. They come in Black, Flame Blue, Yuzu Yellow, and Smoke Gray, and offer much of the same seamless connectivity functionality available with Apple's more expensive Beats options.



Auto-play/pause is included, and the Beats Flex last for up to 12 hours without needing to be recharged. There's a Fast Fuel charging option that offers 1.5 hours of playback, and they feature Find My integration.



The pricing change of the Beats Flex was first noticed by Twitter user Pedro Henrique and was highlighted by 9to5Mac. The Beats Flex can be purchased from the Apple Store, but Amazon currently has them on sale for as low as $37, so those considering a purchase should buy them on Amazon before prices go up.

Apple was brought up as part of Google's attempt to get a massive 4.34 billion euro ($5.1 billion) fine annulled. The European Commission first levied the fine against Google in 2018 because Google pre-installed its own services (Google Search and the Chrome browser) on Android to ensure its dominance in internet search.



According to Google, the European Commission has ignored the dynamic between Apple and Google and has downplayed the impact that Apple has on the mobile device market.

A small adventure in an overwhelmingly interesting world
 Many big-budget video games come with a dedicated photo mode these days — a tool designed specifically for capturing a game within a single frame. There’s no real standard for photo modes: Most come with zoom and camera movement, but no two are the same, allowing players to take a breath to capture something with a shutter click. In Toem, developer Something We Made’s game is built around the idea of a photography mode. That’s the whole game.
It’s part of a growing number of photography games that use the act of capturing photos — and noticing environments around the player — as the main function of the game. Before Toem, Umurangi Generation used photography to tell a story of a decaying world; Alba…]]></summary>

One of the Flyers’ newest blueliners is looking to take their current partnership to a different level.
 The idea of chemistry in hockey is something that cannot be easily contributed to anything or quantified in any particular way. Some players just work better together than others and it might not even be a skill level thing; just a general and innate understanding of what the other dude is going to do with the puck, without the puck, on the forecheck, in all three zones — it’s just a thing.

Prior to taking a look inside the new iPhone, iFixit did X-rays to show off the L-shaped battery, the MagSafe magnet ring, and stabilizing magnets for image sensors and logic boards.



This year's iPhone 13 Pro has an upper sensor cable near the top that's easy to rip during repairs, with iFixit calling it "scary thin." Visually, the Taptic Engine inside the device that controls Haptic Touch appears to be smaller, but it's actually bulkier than the similar component in the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌, weighing in at 6.3 grams, up from 4.8.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple has unveiled limited edition Beats Studio3 headphones in partnership with A-COLD-WALL, a fashion brand by British designer Samuel Ross.





The wireless headphones will be available in a slate color with a "speckled cement" finish that covers both the headphones and ear cushions. There's an ACW logo on the outside of the headband, while the inside of the headband has a clay color with more A-COLD-WALL branding. The included carrying case is also branded with an ACW logo.



The limited edition Beats are listed as coming soon on Apple's online store, with pricing set at $349.95 in the United States.



Apple first released the Beats Studio3 in September 2017 and several limited edition designs have been made available since then. The wireless over-ear headphones feature Apple's W1 chip for seamless setup with Apple devices, up to 22 hours of battery life with active noise cancellation enabled, a foldable design, and more. Keep in mind the headphones are four years old and still have Bluetooth 4.0 and a micro USB port for charging.

In a face-down drop test without a case, the ‌iPhone 13‌ survived a single drop with only minor damage, but it cracked at the top and bottom corners in the second drop test.

 Blizzard Entertainment is making some big changes to the heroes of Overwatch for Overwatch 2, including everyone’s favorite point-and-kill turret robot, Bastion. In addition to sporting a baseball cap borrowed from Torbjorn, Bastion’s abilities are being reimagined for Overwatch 2, Blizzard revealed on Saturday evening at the Overwatch League finals.
In the first Overwatch, Bastion could transform from a walking robot (Recon mode) to a stationary turret (Sentry mode), gaining a higher rate of fire and large ammo reserves at the expense of mobility. In Overwatch 2, Bastion will gain the ability to move (albeit at a slower rate) while in turret form. Bastion is also gaining a new ability — a seconda…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ferrari and its parent company Exor today announced a multi-year creative partnership with LoveFrom, the design firm co-founded by Apple's former design chief Jony Ive and fellow designer Marc Newson.





"The first expression of this new partnership will bring together Ferrari's legendary performance and excellence with LoveFrom's unrivalled experience and creativity that has defined extraordinary world changing products," said Ferrari, in a press release announcing the partnership. "Beyond the collaboration with Ferrari, LoveFrom will explore a range of creative projects with Exor in the business of luxury."



"As Ferrari owners and collectors, we could not be more excited about collaborating with this extraordinary company and in particular with the design team expertly led by Flavio Manzoni," said Ive and Newson, in a joint statement. "We see some uniquely exciting opportunities working together which we believe will yield important and valuable work."



Ive will also join Exor's Partners Council, a group that shares ideas with the company and explores potential business opportunities. 



In June 2019, Apple announced that Ive would be departing the company to form LoveFrom. At the time, Apple said that it would remain one of Ive's primary clients, but it's unclear which Apple products he has helped to design since then, if any. Apple did confirm that Ive was involved in the design of the colorful 24-inch iMac released in April, but Apple did not confirm if any of that work occurred after Ive left the company.



Ive reportedly recruited at least four of his former Apple colleagues to join LoveFrom. Airbnb announced a multi-year partnership with the design firm last year.

Apple has identified an issue where Unlock with Apple Watch
may not work with iPhone 13 devices. You might see “Unable to
Communicate with Apple Watch” if you try to unlock your iPhone
while wearing a face mask, or you might not be able to set up
Unlock with Apple Watch.
This issue will be fixed in an upcoming software update. Until the
update is available, you can turn off Unlock with Apple Watch and
use your passcode to unlock your iPhone 13.
I haven’t seen this issue, but I sympathize with those of you who’ve been hit by it. “Unlock With Apple Watch” almost completely mitigates the annoyance of using an iPhone with Face ID while wearing a mask.

In terms of accessories that are compatible with MagSafe, you'll find the PowerWave Select+ Magnetic Pad for $19.99 ($10 off), and this one functions similarly to Apple's own MagSafe Charger. The main difference is that Anker's accessory only provides wireless charging up to 7.5W, compared to Apple's at up to 15W.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a flood of reports and complaints, Spotify has acknowledged that its app may be causing excessive battery drain and overheating issues on iOS 14.8 and the latest iOS 15 update, promising a fix in the not-so-distant future.





In a long and ongoing support thread on its website, which started weeks ago, Spotify says it is aware of battery drain reports and that it has passed those reports onto its technical iOS team. Spotify doesn't state when a fix could be coming or whether it would be an app update or other troubleshooting steps. 



Users reporting the issue on the thread state that Spotify is listed as a consumer of battery life due to background activity, with no clear reason why. While most of the reports are from users running iOS 14.8 and iOS 15.0, there are also other sporadic reports of battery drainage on older iOS versions. Those users are advised to update for a possible patch and improved security. 



While Spotify is being held as the main culprit for the excessive drainage, it could also be a bug in ‌iOS 15‌ for some users. ‌iOS 15‌ has been littered with multiple bugs, including one limiting Apple Watch functionality with the just-released iPhone 13, issues with Apple Music, and other bugs that Apple has promised fixes for. Apple may be planning to release iOS 15.0.1 as soon as this week to patch those issues and others.

During the last Apple event earlier this month, Apple announced it would be expanding Fitness+ with Guided Meditations. This new workout type builds on the current Mindful Cooldowns workout, allowing Fitness+ users to "reduce everyday stress, develop a greater sense of awareness, and build resilience to face life's challenges." Guided Meditations sessions in 10 and 20 minute lengths will be available.



Alongside Strength, Core, and Yoga workouts, Fitness+ today also gained Pilates, a new low-impact workout that focuses on improving strength and flexibility. Pilates sessions will be guided and headed by Marimba Gold-Watts and Darryl Whiting, both professionals in fitness. Fitness+ is also gaining a new "Workouts to Get Ready for Snow Season" guide with workouts to improve skiers' and snowboarders' performance ahead of the winter. 



Later this fall, Apple Fitness+ will be expanding to 15 additional countries, including Austria, Brazil, Colombia, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Switzerland, and the UAE. Fitness+ will also be gaining group workouts powered by SharePlay later this year.

The term refers to a noticeable effect when scrolling vertically through text-based content like a webpage or document, where each line of text appears to tilt down towards the left of the screen as it passes by. The effect makes it look as though one side of the display is responding faster than the other when a finger drags to scroll the page.

From the note:

We forecast that the shipment of Apple Silicon processor-based MacBook models will be cut by approximately 15% in 1H22 and attribute it to three reasons: 1) component shortages, 2) structural demand change in the post- COVID-19 era, and 3) product transition between legacy and new models. 
According to Kuo, the shortage of components relates primarily to a continuing lack of power management integrated circuits, for which delivery times currently extend as fa…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple plans to begin mass production of an upcoming redesigned MacBook Air featuring an updated, more powerful Apple silicon processor in the third quarter of 2022, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said today in a research note obtained by MacRumors.





Kuo has previously stated that the new MacBook Air will feature an entirely new design, including a mini-LED display and a more powerful Apple silicon processor. Kuo had earlier pinpointed a launch around the middle of 2022, now providing a more specific timeline for the late second quarter or early third quarter of 2022 for mass production getting underway. 



Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has reported that the new MacBook Air will feature a "thinner and lighter" enclosure, two USB 4 ports, and a MagSafe charging connector. Apple leaker and YouTube personality Jon Prosser shared renders for the alleged upcoming MacBook Air earlier this year, showing most notably of all that Apple plans to release the new laptop in a range of colors, similar to the 24-inch M1 iMac. 



Apple last updated its MacBook Air with the M1 chip last November, which maintained the previous MacBook Air design. Despite the expectation that Apple will update several Macs in its lineup with Apple silicon before the end of this year, the MacBook Air doesn't seem like it'll be one of them.

A couple free agency acquisitions are stoked as hell.
 Claude Giroux’s contract is on the mind of every single Philadelphia Flyers fan and staff member as they head into an all-important season to show that last year’s tumble down the standings was a fluke. It is the final year of the captain’s eight-year contract extension signed way back in 2013.
And while the contract talk between Flyers GM Chuck Fletcher and Giroux will be had a later date, letting this season play out to determine where to go from here with one of the franchise’s most beloved stars.
The general feeling is not a matter of if they are going to sign him, but for how long and how much. Especially considering just how damn respected he is around his locker room…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today said an issue preventing some iPhone 13 users from using the Unlock with Apple Watch feature will be fixed in an upcoming software update.





In a support document, Apple said affected users can turn off Unlock with Apple Watch and use their passcode to unlock their iPhone 13 until the software update is released. The feature, which is designed to let you unlock your iPhone while wearing a mask or ski goggles, can be toggled off in the Settings app under Face ID & Passcode.



Apple did not specify which software update will include a fix, nor did it provide a timeframe. The first beta of iOS 15.1 was released five days ago, but Apple could also choose to release a minor iOS 15.0.1 update with bug fixes.



As we reported, affected users might see an "Unable to Communicate with Apple Watch" error message if they try to unlock their iPhone 13 while wearing a face mask, or they might not be able to set up Unlock with Apple Watch.

Interesting results that jibe with Apple’s claims about the improvements to battery life in the iPhones 13.
Via Avi Greengart, who observes the most impressive result:
It’s worth watching Arun’s whole video, but the iPhone 13 mini
handily beats last year’s full-sized iPhone 12 on battery life,
making it an easy recommendation for anyone with human-sized
hands. The entire iPhone 13 line has genuinely good to
extraordinary battery life.
The iPhone 13 Mini has longer battery life than last year’s regular iPhone 12. That’s a game-changer for those who want the Mini size.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MacOS 12 Monterey is not out yet — and, I hope, won’t ship until after a few more weeks of much-needed bug fixes — but Safari 15 for MacOS 11 Big Sur shipped last week. I strongly recommend not upgrading, unless you’ve already tried the new tab design and like it, or at least feel ambivalent about it. Updates like this are why I always turn off “Automatically keep my Mac up to date” in System Preferences → Software Update.
The sole reason I recommend not upgrading to Safari 15 is the new tab bar design. You can easily try it out for yourself, though, without upgrading to Safari 15 or installing the MacOS 12 betas. Safari Technology Preview is a separate version of Safari you can easily install next to regular Safari. Typically it’s used by web developers to test in-progress changes to WebKit, but right now it’s more useful as a way to preview the new Safari 15 tab design. It’s easy to install and easy to uninstall. You can even set it as your default web browser while testing in System Preferences: General.

Apple told MacRumors that all third-party apps can take full advantage of 120Hz ProMotion refresh rates, but developers will need to declare that their apps use higher frame rates by adding an entry to their app's plist. Documentation on the required plist entry will be made available to developers soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sponsorships have been selling briskly this year, but I’ve only just now opened spots for the October-December quarter. Plus, a last-minute change has opened up next week’s spot, starting this coming Monday.
One sponsor per week, with a sponsor-written entry in the RSS feed to start the week, a thank-you post right on the homepage from me at the end, and the one and only graphic ad on every page of the site all week long. No tracking or other privacy-invasive bullshit. Just plain honest ads. That’s not new — that’s the way the ads on DF have always been. My best argument that they work: the number of repeat companies in the sponsor archive list.
So if you’ve got a product or service you’d like to promote to DF’s discerning audience, I’d love to have you as a sponsor. And if you’re ready to grab next week’s opening, let’s go — should be another good week.

If you look at it solely as a technology product you’re missing the biggest part of the iPhone story. iPhone Day is a de facto annual holiday for untold millions of people around the world.
That’s not true of any other product in the world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alex Kantrowitz, writing for CNBC:
“Just completely running blind” is how Aaron Paul, a performance
Facebook marketer, described it. Paul said his company, Carousel,
moved from spending millions of dollars each day on Facebook to a
few hundred thousand dollars. Before the iOS changes, Facebook
generated 80% of the traffic Carousel sent to its product pages.
Now it accounts for 20%.
Apple’s iOS changes may lead to irreparable harm to Facebook’s ad
business. This moment has demonstrated to Paul and his fellow
performance buyers that relying on one channel (albeit a very
effective one) is risky. So they’re looking to diversify their ad
spend. Paul said he’s moved his ad budget elsewhere, including
“Snapchat and TikTok, but also silent killers like email.” On
Twitter, Facebook marketers discussing Apple’s changes
almost unanimously agreed they needed to follow suit.

If you haven’t played Aria of Sorrow yet, now is the time
 I adore Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. It defined the Metroidvania genre, and no other Castlevania game has ever topped its enormous scope. And yet, when people ask me for my favorite game in the series, I don’t point to a symphony — I point to an aria.
Each of the three Game Boy Advance Castlevania games were inspired by the exploration-first gameplay of Symphony of the Night, to varying degrees of success. Of those first two games, 2001’s Circle of the Moon handily bests 2002’s Harmony of Dissonance, but neither could hold a whippable candle to the PlayStation inspiration that came before. They are enjoyable, even today, but they’re not games I often relish returning to. In hindsight, it tu…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The new iPhone 13 Pro models that launched today are equipped with ProMotion display technology, which allows for adaptive refresh rates ranging from 10Hz all the way to 120Hz, which is ideal for scrolling through content, gaming, and more, because it makes for a smoother viewing experience.





Though there's a 120Hz maximum refresh rate, App Store developers have found that most app animations are limited to 60Hz, which results in an uneven viewing experience for users. As noted by 9to5Mac, ProMotion works at the full 120Hz for scrolling and full-screen transitions, but animations are limited to 60Hz.



So when you're scrolling through your Twitter timeline, for example, you'll see the smooth ProMotion experience, but animations at 60Hz mean other interactions are noticeably …]]></summary>

Keep reading to learn how it works.





With Macro mode enabled, you can take pictures or video of subjects that are as close as 2cm to your iPhone's camera lens, which means you can now take shots of flowers, textures, insects, or pretty much anything small or at close distance, with accurate focus, rich detail, and no blurring.



Here's how to use the Macro mode feature on ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ Max. Bear in mind that Macro mode is exclusive to these models and isn't supported on iPhone 13 mini or ‌iPhone 13‌.

Pixel artist Lux redesigned 80 meal sprites
 Food has always been cute in Stardew Valley, the popular farming sim developed by Eric Barone. A new food mod adds more realistic, charming details to Stardew Valley’s meal sprites, and puts them in an isometric perspective. The mod designer, who goes by Lux on Twitter, has redesigned 80 of Stardew Valley’s cooked meal items. And while the classic sprites have always looked cheery, this is the first time I’ve seen a mod that makes me literally want to eat these meals — especially given the, erm, interesting way you acquire some of them.

They’ve been waiting there for hours, and they will be waiting for hours more, hoping for a chance to fight a big bad boss. These people aren’t united in that goal — in fact, it’s a competition, and one that requires an absurd amount of time, focus, and dedication. But they are united in doing it for a worthy cause.
In an ongoing series of back-and-forth battles, hundreds of people have assembled on a private server of EverQuest to raise funds for a family devastated by Hurricane Ida. The family’s home sustained major flood damage, and the money will be used to “purcha…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple this week opened its newest Apple Store in New York City, Apple The Mall at Bay Plaza, which also happens to be the first Apple retail location in the Bronx.





‌Apple Store‌ aficionado Michael Steeber teamed up with Storeteller for a virtual 360-degree walkthrough of the new location, giving us an in-depth look at the features and improvements that Apple has brought to its latest ‌Apple Store‌.



Apple The Mall at Bay Plaza may look similar to most other Apple retail locations, but it has a unique feature - a dedicated Pickup Zone. The Pickup Zone is a permanent installation within the store, featuring a dedicated table where customers can get their new devices from employees and more interestingly, a wall of built-in drawers where all the pickup orders are housed.





In most Apple retail locations, employees must go to the back to retrieve orders that have been placed for in-store pickup, but that won't be the case with Apple The Mall at Bay Plaza, and it is the first store with this setup rather than a Forum area.



Along with the Pickup Zone, the store also features an area with round tables for training, and a series of Forum displays. There are leather seats along the walls for those waiting for Genius Bar appointments, and the front of the store is outfitted with sliding glass doors.



Make sure to check out the full store walkthrough to get a feel for the new design.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[iFixit is gearing up for one of traditional teardowns of the new iPhone 13 models, but ahead of that full teardown, iFixit has done a live event to give us a first glimpse inside the refreshed devices.






As we've seen in prior inside looks, the new iPhones have smaller, square-shaped Taptic Engines, and the iPhone 13 Pro has a smaller, denser logic board than the ‌iPhone 13‌ along with an L-shaped battery and a larger internal camera module.



Battery capacities were unveiled earlier today, and ‌iPhone 13‌ models have larger batteries across the board. The ‌iPhone 13‌ mini has a 2,406 mAh battery, the ‌iPhone 13‌ has a 3,227 mAh battery, the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ has a 3,095 mAh battery, and the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ Max has a 4,352 mAh battery.



iFixit's live teardown is interesting for those who want to see a step-by-step deconstruction of the device, but there's not a lot of new information to learn at this point. iFixit plans to publish a more in-depth teardown next week, which should give us some more insight on the internal components.

As the name suggests, the Urban iPad Stand has a strong built-in magnet that's designed to attach to a compatible ‌iPad‌. Like the iPhone and a MagSafe charger, the ‌iPad‌ and the stand automatically align with one another.





Once on the stand, the ‌iPad‌ is at an ideal height to provide an ergonomic viewing experience, and with the adjustable hinge at the back, it can be rotated around 360 degrees to any viewing angle that works best for you. It's useful for watching movies, working with a keyboard and mouse, drawing, and more.

The program is designed to help Apple keep its software platforms as safe as possible.





In the time since, reports have surfaced indicating that some security researchers are unhappy with the program, and now a security researcher who uses the pseudonym "illusionofchaos" has shared their similarly "frustrating experience."



In a blog post highlighted by Kosta Eleftheriou, the unnamed security researcher said they reported four zero-day vulnerabilities to Apple between March and May of this year, but they said that three of t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don’t know if a 10-second sequence of a plane landing in one of Brian De Palma’s worst films properly qualifies as “The Most Difficult Shot in Movie History”, but the story behind it is genuinely interesting. The logistics of having only 30 seconds out of an entire year to get this exact shot of the setting sun and coordinating that with a landing supersonic jet at one of the world’s busiest airports are certainly daunting. As Patrick Willems notes in his commentary, this shot also signifies the end of an era in the film industry.

While the test is not scientific, and might not perfectly reflect real-world usage, the video still provides us with a good idea of how the new iPhone 13 models stack up to previous generations in terms of battery life.



The winning device in the test was the iPhone 13 Pro Max, which achieved an impressive 9 hours and 52 minutes of battery life with continuous usage. Maini said this is the longest battery life of any iPhone that he has ever …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the launch of the iPhone 13 series, Apple introduced several new camera features that take advantage of the A15 Bionic processor and advanced machine learning. One of these is called Cinematic Mode. This article explains what Cinematic Mode is and how to use it.





What is Cinematic Mode?


Cinematic Mode utilizes Dolby Vision HDR and a technique called "rack focus" to seamlessly shift the focus from one subject to another when you're shooting video. It does this by locking the focus on the subject in a scene and blurring the background to achieve depth of field. If you subsequently move the camera to center on a new subject or a new subject enters the scene, Cinematic mode automatically switches the focal point to this new subject and blurs out the background.

Nothing’s changing at typography.com, where you’ll still find all
1,113 fonts in the Hoefler&Co library, as well as the
cloud.typography webfont service, and all the other resources
we’ve created for designers and brands. The H&Co team is staying
in place, too, and there are yet more typefaces from us that you
can look forward to seeing soon. […]
In the meantime, I’ll be stepping down from my role in the
company, to finally make the time to recharge, reflect, and
explore some new ideas. In these past few years, participating in
a documentary and using typography to help elect a
president have been potent reminders of just how many ways
there are for type to make a difference, and just how many people
are moved by the splendor of typography.
I’d need 144-point type to express my surprise at this announcement.

Those 27 games? I wouldn’t worry too much about those 27 little games last year. 
 No. 1: Carter Hart
2020-21 League/Team(s): Flyers/Phantoms
2020-21 Statistics: .877 SV%, 3.67 GAA, 27 games
Age: 23
Acquired In: 2016 NHL Entry Draft, 52nd overall
Ranking in Spring 2020 25 Under 25: 2
How did Hart’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
So Carter Hart graded out as perhaps the worst starting goaltender in the NHL in 2020-21. 
Now that’s out of the way, we can get into why he’s still the Flyers’ top prospect under 25 years of age by unpacking a bit of what went wrong last season and why the 27-game sample size falls where it does.
We’ve already addressed how bizarre the 2020-2…]]></summary>

In this article, we take a look at what Photographic Styles are and how to use them.





Photographic Styles consist of a series of subtle filter-like adjustments that you can enable before you've taken any photos, allowing you to bring a stylistic effect to your shots beforehand that won't affect the skin tone of your subjects. These styles come in four presets: Vibrant, Rich Contrast, Warm, and Cool. 



Vibrant captures the shot in bright, vivid, yet natural-looking colors, while Rich Contrast adds a more dramatic look that makes shadows darker and increases color and contrast. Warm adds a summery golden…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Launch day has arrived for all four iPhone 13 models in over 30 countries, marking the start of in-store availability of the devices.





In countries such as the United States, Canada, and the UK, some iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro configurations are available for same-day pickup at select Apple Stores as of the time this story was published. Apple Store pickup is the best option for customers who did not pre-order an iPhone 13 model, as placing an order through Apple's online store today could result in a lengthy wait time of 4-6 weeks for delivery.



To check if an iPhone 13 model is available for Apple Store pickup, head to the iPhone 13 or iPhone 13 Pro order page, configure the iPhone as you would like it, and look for a "Pickup" option towards the bottom of the page. A link below the "Pickup" option leads to an iPhone Availability tool, which displays iPhone 13 models available for pickup at nearby Apple Stores based on the zip code or postal code that you enter.



Key features across all four iPhone 13 models include a faster A15 Bionic chip, camera improvements, longer battery life, and a smaller notch. The two Pro models also feature a ProMotion display with a variable refresh rate up to 120Hz, up to 1TB of storage, and additional camera features like Night mode portraits and ProRes video recording.



In the United States, starting prices are the same as they were for the iPhone 12 lineup, including $699 for the iPhone 13 mini, $799 for the iPhone 13, $999 for the iPhone 13 Pro, and $1,099 for the iPhone 13 Pro Max.



The sixth-generation iPad mini and ninth-generation iPad are also available for same-day pickup at select Apple Stores starting today.

How did Farabee’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
This quote from our season review of Farabee is quite telling of his 2020-21 season:
If one considers Farabee’s rookie season a success, comparatively in a year devoid of standout performances, his sophomore season is a highlight. At just twenty years old, playing in the top six, it appears that only the sky is the limit for the Syracuse native.

*If nothing else, training camp is when lingering questions begin to be answered heading into the season. It’s going to be a fun couple of weeks. [Inquirer]
*Like the rest of us, Alain Vigneault isn’t interested in talking about last season anymore. It’s This Season now. [NBC Sports Philly]
*The 25 Under 25 is coming to a close, which means we are getting to the Big Boys. Morgan Frost has a big time opportunity to make himself a roster regular this year, and he clocked in at number five. [BSH]
*Despite a down year, Travis Konecny still made it all the way to number four. [BSH]
*And at number three, Ivan Provorov. We’ll find out which player took the top spot today; place your bets! [BSH]
*Conjuring up Lindros-related flashbacks yesterday, the ridiculous Buffalo Sabres organization stripped the C from Jack Eichel after he failed to pass his physical. Which he didn’t pass because they won’t let him fix his neck. What a mess up there. [Die By The Blade]
*We know the Flyers’ goalie situation; let’s look around the Metro and see what everyone else is working with. [Canes Country]
*DGB has released his Bizarro-Meter rankings for the Eastern Conference. Take a guess what he’s deemed the weirdest thing the Flyers did this offseason. [The Athletic]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A bunch of you are probably getting new iPhones (and iPads) today. As someone who’s set up 5 new devices in the last week, my advice is to restore a new iPhone with the Quick Start device-to-device transfer, not iCloud backup. Don’t worry if it says it might take a little longer this way, it’s worth it. Get a cup of coffee or a bite to eat. A watched pot never boils; a watched transfer never finishes.
Device-to-device is better because it moves over all your login credentials. When you restore from an iCloud backup, you wind up logged out of a lot of apps on the new device. When you restore device-to-device, almost everything moves over. I know there are exceptions, but I don’t think I bounced into a single app that didn’t keep me fully logged in this week. If you tried device-to-device a few years ago and found it lacking, try it again now — Apple has improved this process every year since it debuted. Worst case scenario, you can always start over and use iCloud backup.
Also, you do not need to unpair your Apple Watch from your old iPhone using this method. You can just wear your watch the whole time. When the transfer is complete, the new iPhone will prompt you, asking if you want to move your watch to the new iPhone. Your mileage may vary but it just worked for me.
I posted this on Twitter tonight, and realized I should post about this here too. The Twitter thread has a bunch of Q&A’s about specific apps, like authentication tokens in Authy (they transfer fine).

The best way to extract the most out of the smallest iPad is to
think of it as a device enhanced by non-keyboard input methods — Scribble with Pencil, snapping photos with the cameras, or
using Siri/voice input. The improved “Scribble” allows you to
make notes, do quick searches, and even find directions. It is a
very addictive way to use the iPad, especially in the smaller

The more I use the device, the more I realize that most computing

I had the opportunity to see the new @surface devices live … and I
am so glad I did.
Holding #SurfaceDuo in my hand, seeing the clever case that
secures the #SurfacePen that looks like a finish rather than a
case not adding any thickness, the fluidity of the screen and
the clever gaming controls…. Very much looking forward to giving
it a spin!
Amen to this enthusiasm for seeing the product introduction live. I get it why Apple did not hold an in-person press event last week — iPhone events are huge, and while I think small events can safely be held in person now, there’s no practical way to shrink the iPhone event.
I miss having hands-on time with new devices as soon as keynotes end. You pick up on things immediately: that something is heavier or lighter than you expected. That certain colors or finishes look different. Remember the Jet Black iPhone 7? You had to see it in person to understand how it looked. And I miss in-person briefings, both official ones and unofficial. In-person communication simply cannot be beaten for conveying subtlety.
Product reviews are hampered too. With in-person Apple events, most reviewers get kit in the hours after the keynote ends. With virtual Apple events, the kit ships for delivery the next day. An extra day makes a big difference when the review embargo drops just one week after the event.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nice supercut video from The Verge squeezing Microsoft’s Surface event yesterday into eight minutes. A few thoughts:
It seems like Microsoft is letting the Surface division stand on its own, brand-wise. They’re not distancing themselves from Microsoft in any way, but branding-wise they’re just letting the products be the “Surface Whatever”, not the “Microsoft Surface Whatever”. There’s even a moment in the event, regarding the folding Duo 2 phone, when a guy says it has “the most precise and reliable hinge mechanism ever engineered at Surface”. I.e. that it was “Surface” who engineered that hinge, not “Microsoft”. I think Surface works as a Microsoft sub-brand like that.
Speaking of the Surface Duo 2 — their folding phone with two screens — they’re now just calling it what they should have called it all along: a phone. It’s a very interesting and unique form factor, but it’s a big folding phone, not a small folding tablet. It supposedly has real cameras this time, too. Starting price: $1,500.
The new Surface Laptop Studio looks really dumb to me. I don’t understand why one would ever want to use it in either of the new folding positions. I guess maybe if you really want to draw on it, you might want to fold it flat, but if you really want to draw that much, why not buy the Surface Pro 8 that detaches from the keyboard? This design just seems dumb.
The Surface Slim Pen 2 introduces haptic feedback, to simulate the feel of a pen on paper. I love stuff like that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Joe Rossignol, reporting for MacRumors:
Apple Watch Series 7 models are equipped with a new module that
enables 60.5GHz wireless data transfer, according to FCC
filings viewed by MacRumors, but this functionality may be
reserved for Apple’s internal use only for now.
The filings indicate that the 60.5GHz module is only activated
when the Apple Watch is placed on a proprietary magnetic dock with
a corresponding 60.5GHz module, but this dock will likely be
reserved for use by Apple employees. For example, it’s possible
that Apple Stores might use the dock to wirelessly restore an
Apple Watch, and if so, it will be interesting to see if Series 7
models still have a hidden diagnostic port for wired connectivity.
This is a little interesting in and of itself. But if you look at the long-term trend, it’s a sign that Apple — along with the rest of the industry — is moving toward wireless technology for both charging and data transfer. Apple Watch exemplifies that — it’s never had a port, either for charging or data. There’s a diagnostic port hidden inside the bottom channel for the watch strap, but those diagnostics are neither charging nor data.
It’s long been my guess that iPhone is never going to support USB-C. I think it’s Apple’s intention to go straight from Lightning to wireless/inductive, with no “port”. Portless is the future for all devices. Yet the product design geniuses at the European Commission want to mandate all devices have one specific port in 2024 and indefinitely thereafter — a port that by that time will already be 10 years old.

The European Union unveiled plans on Thursday to make USB-C

hit Apple the hardest.
The move would represent a long-awaited yet aggressive step into

innovation and lead to more electronic waste as all current

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Diamond is a contemplative short documentary by Caitlyn Greene about the people who look for diamonds in an ancient volcanic crater at the Crater of Diamonds State Park in Arkansas. Whatever you find there, you can keep. But what are they really searching for?
I came across an article about the Crater of Diamonds State Park in Arkansas, which I learned is the world’s only public diamond-bearing site. People from all walks of life search for diamonds atop this ancient volcanic crater, and it’s finders keepers. Some people find substantial diamonds, some don’t, and either way, it takes a lot of digging in the dirt. I was immediately hooked on the metaphor of this place.
I was interested in the hope of treasure, the grittiness of searching, and what people there were actually looking for in their lives. Creatively, I wanted to push an interview-driven piece, especially one in which subjects are given freedom to take you where they want to go, rather than guiding interviews along a plot-driven track. Errol Morris’ Vernon, Florida was a huge inspiration for this approach.


That loudspeaker announcement right at the beginning is surreal — a great way to set the tone for the rest of the film.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No big deal — just a safari expedition to Tanzania. Lions, leopards, giraffes. Ultra wide angle 4K 60 video shot from an iPhone 13 Pro mounted to a helicopter. Your typical iPhone camera review.
The review starts with a terrific movie — including some truly pro-looking Cinematic mode shots — by Taylor McKay.
I thought this was a pretty interesting observation from Mann:
Although the iPhone 13 Pro still only has three lenses, the
addition of macro capability is like adding a new lens altogether,
and for the serious photographer I think it’s perhaps the
strongest advancement in this year’s camera system. […]
Photographer or not, you’ve seen the big and heavy backpacks
photographers carry with them on every shoot. Whether it’s local
or international, we lug these bags full of lenses around because
each one offers a new perspective on whatever story it is that
we’re telling.
As a photographer passionate about the natural world, I carry a
macro lens with me no matter what project I’m working on, just
because I never know what tiny detail of interest might present
itself. Now with the macro capability of the iPhone 13 Pro, I feel
like I have my “in-a-pinch” macro shots covered and I can leave
the rarely-used macro lens at home.
Everything you see in this video was shot with a $1,000 device meant to fit in your pocket.
Some great iOS 15 tips from Mann, too, including using the new Focus feature to create a custom “Shoot Mode” with no notifications whenever he’s using the Camera app or Halide. Also, Mann’s custom Photographic Style settings.

“We feel like this is the kind of thing that Apple tackles the

I have collected some of my Full Moon shots taken over the past 10 years. I selected the shades of color with which the Moon was filmed in front of my lens and my eyes.
The atmosphere gives different colors to our satellite (scattering) based on its height with respect to the horizon, based on the presence of humidity or suspended dust. The shape of the Moon also changes: at the bottom of the horizon, refraction compresses the lunar disk at the poles and makes it look like an ellipse.

        <link href="https://popular.info/p/apples-texas-problem"/>
        <updated>2021-09-23T18:58:55.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Judd Legum, writing at Popular Information:
On Friday, CEO Tim Cook answered a question about Apple’s stance
on the Texas ban at an all-staff meeting. Cook said that “the
company was looking into whether it could aid the legal fight
against the new law.”
Apple has considerable leverage over the abortion debate in Texas
and across the country — but it is not related to its ability to
pay for lawyers. Apple’s leverage rests in its status as a major
employer and driver of economic growth.
If Apple believes that its employees should be able to “make their
own decisions regarding their reproductive health,” it could
publicly state that it will not expand its workforce in states
that limit abortion rights. That would have a major influence not
only in Texas but in numerous states considering following Texas’
lead.
Last week, TechCrunch published the text of a company-wide memo posted to an internal Apple message board regarding Texas’s near-outlawing of abortion. It began:
A message about women’s reproductive health care
At Apple, we support our employees’ rights to make their own
decisions regarding their reproductive health.
Legum is right — it’s untenable for Apple, or any other company, to “support our employees’ rights to make their own decisions regarding their reproductive health” and ask any woman to work for the company in a state with a law like Texas’s. An immediate hiring and construction freeze in Texas — explicitly tied to this outrageous law (which makes no exceptions for rape or incest) — is the only tenable action compatible with Apple’s stated values.
David Simon, linking to Legum’s post:
If an employer, this is beyond politics. I’m turning in scripts
next month on an HBO non-fiction miniseries based on events in
Texas, but I can’t and won’t ask female cast/crew to forgo civil
liberties to film there. What else looks like Dallas/Ft. Worth?
That’s the answer. You move your business out of Texas. Any company that expands or initiates new operations in Texas implicitly supports Texas’s abortion ban.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ice Ball is a short documentary that follows legendary polar explorer Will Steger and the community that he’s built up around harvesting ice from frozen winter lakes near Ely in northern Minnesota. Steger lives off the grid and uses the harvested ice for refrigeration — the ice keeps everything cool in the ice house for the whole year, until the next harvest.
Best known for his legendary polar explorations, Will Steger’s life work grew out of a single log cabin he built after moving to the Minnesotan wilderness at age 25. Reliant on sustainable energy and natural commodities, Steger formed a community and culture based on the principle of mutuality. Central to Steger’s operation is the lost art of cutting ice for refrigeration. This annual harvest formed a tradition spanning fifty years that became known as the “Ice Ball”. While this old world technology inevitably became obsolete, its disappearance parallels a concerning loss of social interdependence in modern society.


Come for the ice harvesting, stay for the wonderful Minnesotan accents. (via colossal)

TK didn’t have a stellar 2020-21, continuing a downward trend that began in the COVID-19 bubble playoffs. After a huge breakout via leading the team in points, fans expected Konecny to produce like a top line player, and he failed to deliver anything outside of the odd offensive explosion. There are caveats behind why his performance wasn’t up to the lofty predictions 2019-20 warranted, but all the same…]]></summary>

Here’s the short version of how that came to be: People used to drink a lot of alcohol because water was unsafe, so folks were often in a sort of low-grade stupor. When coffee hit Europe, it provided the stimulation, focus, and energy necessary for people to work better and longer. Voila, the Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution.
You can read more about caffeine in Pollan’s latest book This Is Your Mind on Plants (excerpt here) or in his 2020 audiobook called Caffeine: How Caffeine Created the Modern World.

*This new guy almost certainly won’t figure into the mix, but with all of these preseason injuries, it’ll be interesting to see who steps up to fill those holes. [BSH]

*At seven, everyone’s current favorite rookie, Wade Allison. [BSH]
*And juuuuust short of the top five, promising young ginger defenseman Cam York. [BSH]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ben Bajarin, writing at Creative Strategies:
While I will admit there is a small percentage of Apple customers
who upgrade every year and a percentage more who upgrade every two
years because they are on upgrade plans, the vast majority of
consumers upgrade every 3-4 years. I thought it would be
interesting to look at some basic iPhone benchmarks through the
years and look at how much performance improvement happens every
four years.
Incremental improvements every year turn into profound improvements over 3–4 years. It’s like the technology version of compound interest. It adds up.
As I benchmarked the A15 Bionic in different ways and pondered how
Apple spends its transistor budget with each A-series chip cycle,
an interesting shift emerged for iPhone 13. Going back to how
Apple spends their transistor budget on features, not necessarily
performance, for the A15, Apple looks to have had the most GPU
gains YoY since the A9. For the past five years, Apple has had an
average of 19% GPU gains YoY but for the A15 Bionic, Apple has
increased GPU performance by 52%.
This intentional increase in GPU performance over CPU performance
speaks to the more graphically intense features Apple had in mind
for iPhone 13 that is demonstrated in things like macro
photography, macro video, and Cinematic Mode. Developers also now
have a dramatically increased GPU at their disposal to create new
app experiences around and can leverage new augmented reality
techniques, visual computing and AI, and more.
It’s almost enough to make one think that Apple is ready to release high-end professional Macs built around Apple GPUs.

Went hands on with the iPhone 13 Pro and immediately wanted to
test out the camera and cinematic mode. It’s limited to 1080p
30fps but I was surprised to see how sharp it was AND that it
retained Dolby Vision.
Interesting to see Cinematic mode in the hands of a talented videographer. Easily the best “in the wild” Cinematic mode video I’ve seen. (Explicit lyrics in the song.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From Wired’s review of the iPhone 4S:
Apple never specified what the “S” stands for in iPhone 4S, and it
may as well stand for Siri. Sure, the fifth-generation iPhone’s
superb camera and speedy dual-core processor are classy additions.
But Siri is the reason people should buy this phone. […]
The iPhone 4S looks exactly the same as its predecessor — but who
cares? If it was shaped even slightly differently or came in a new
color, people would still go nuts over the stuff that’s more
important anyway: the insides. And both inside and out, this is a
magnificent smartphone.
The late Steve Jobs once called the computer the equivalent of a
bicycle for our minds. I think of the smartphone as the rocket
ship for our minds. With increasingly powerful sensors and
technologies, and access to hundreds of thousands of apps enabling
us to do just about anything, the iPhone keeps soaring to
incredible heights and taking us to places with limitless
potential. I guess that’s what you have to do to create a ding in
the universe.
I don’t know what happened to the fellow who wrote this review 10 years ago, but The New York Times could sure use a personal tech critic with this sort of enthusiasm and insight into the way that incremental improvements aggregate in just a few years in profound ways.

There are more than 1 billion iPhone users. The total number of
users has been rising steadily. iPhone users make up about 26% of
all smartphone users (3.8 billion is the current estimate). The
share of users in the US is about 60% (or soon will be.) The share
in UK is close to 50%. All these share numbers are higher than
ever. Over 14% of US and 10% of UK survey respondents have
switched to an iPhone in the past two years.
I was not aware that churn was so strongly in the favor of iPhone over the last two years. Pretty good for a phone that Henry Blodget declared “dead in the water” in 2012. The downside to this trend, if it continues, is Apple might start running into being deemed an actual monopolist — by which I mean holding a monopoly share of phones p…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple is planning to give its Apple Store employees one-time bonuses amounting to up to $1,000, reports Bloomberg. The bonuses will be provided to employees who have been working during the ongoing global health crisis.





Retail employees who were hired before March 31, 2021 will be given $1,000, and employees who joined after that date will be given $500. Employees hired for the holiday shopping season will get $200. Apple plans to provide the bonuses to those who work in retail stores, those who do online sales, and AppleCare staff.



Apple does not often give bonuses to its retail staff. The last bonus went out in 2018 when Apple granted $2,500 in restricted stock units to most of its employees, including those working at Apple Stores. The bonuses were handed out after the introduction of new U.S. tax laws and were given to most employees below a director level.



The $1,000 bonuses will be provided as paychecks rather than as stock units like the prior bonus and are designed as a thank you to employees for their efforts during the pandemic.

Here’s a rough idea of when Festival of the Lost, The Dawning, Bungie’s 30th Anniversary Event, and Moments of Triumph will appear in Destiny 2
 After four weeks of Destiny 2’s Season of the Lost, Bungie finally launched the calendar and roadmap for the game’s current season. But unlike previous schedules, which listed out the exact dates for events and quests, Season of the Lost’s calendar roadmap is surprisingly sparse. 
Season of the Lost is already in a unique position. Due to The Witch Queen’s delay earlier this year, Season of the Lost will run from August of this year to Feb. 22, 2022. That’s a six month season, where seasons like Splicer and Chosen traditionally last for only three. With the long season, Bungie has a lot of seasonal events to cram into Season…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Within the past 50 years, the global community has solved two huge problems that had the potential to harm every person on Earth. Smallpox once killed 30% of the people who contracted the disease but through the invention of an effective, safe vaccine and an intense effort that began in the 1960s, smallpox was completely eradicated by 1980. In the 1980s, scientists discovered a hole in the ozone layer that protects the Earth from UV radiation; further depletion would have caused major problems with the world’s food supply and an epidemic of skin cancer. Forty years later, we’ve virtually eliminated the chemicals causing the depletion and ozone losses have stabilized and have recently shown improvement.
So how did we do it? The short video above talks through each of challenges, how they were met (science + politics + a bit of luck), and how we might apply these lessons to the big problems of today (climate emergency, the pandemic).

The Surface Laptop Studio is Microsoft's "most powerful Surface" to date, and it replaces the Surface Book line of laptops. Rather than a removable display like prior models, Microsoft has adopted a design that looks rather similar to Apple's Magic Keyboard. The 14.4-inch display lifts up and can be pulled forward into a tablet mode.

Public beta testers who have signed up for Apple's beta testing program can download the iOS and ‌iPadOS 15.1‌ updates over the air after installing the proper certificate from the Public Beta website.



SharePlay makes a return in iOS 15.1, with Apple once again testing the feature that was removed before the launch of iOS 15. SharePlay is designed to let users call their friends and family and interact by watching movies, watching TV, or listening to music together.



Apple has added features like shared playlists and TV show syncing so everyone sees the same thing at the same time. SharePlay also has a built-in screen sharing feature, and Apple is still working out the bugs.



Paired with the HomePod 15.1 beta (which is invite only), iOS 15.1 adds Lossless Audio and Dolby Atmos with Spatial Audio support to the ‌HomePod‌ and the HomePod mini, bringing Apple's speakers in line with iPhones, iPads, and Macs.



iPhone users who have a health care provider or state record that uses SMART Health Cards can import their COVID-19 vaccination records into the Health app and can then add a vaccine card to the Wallet app. This is an opt-in feature that uses a global specification, but healthcare providers need to implement it.



Right now, Smart Health Cards are or will be available to those in California, Louisiana, New York, Virginia, Hawaii, and some Maryland counties, as well those who were vaccinated at Walmart, Sam's Club, and CVS Health. Healthcare providers like electronic health record vendors like Epic and Cerner also support Smart Health Cards.

Apple could keep Fortnite off Mac and iOS for five years
 Following a ruling in Fortnite creator Epic Games’ lawsuit against Apple, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney says Apple will blacklist Fortnite from its ecosystem until its appeals process makes the judgment final.
“Apple lied,” Sweeney said on Twitter. “Apple spent a year telling the world, the court, and the press they’d ‘welcome Epic’s return to the App Store if they agree to play by the same rules as everyone else.’ Epic agreed, and now Apple has reneged in another abuse of its monopoly power over a billion users.”
Sweeney said that Apple’s decision could keep Fortnite off iOS and Mac platforms for as long as five years as the appeals process plays out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The photographer Austin Mann has today published his in-depth annual review of the latest iPhone's camera capabilities, this time focusing on the iPhone 13 Pro. Mann's tests were performed in Ruaha National Park, Tanzania, looking at each of the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌'s camera upgrades, including Macro mode, increased telephoto zoom and Cinematic mode.

Mann said that macro mode, which uses the Ultra Wide lens and allows users to take photos around 2cm away from a subject, is "perhaps the strongest advancement in this year's camera system" and fulfills a clear need for many photographers. Images in Macro mode are still able to be fairly sharp in low-light and amid camera shake. Macro effectivel…]]></summary>

How did York’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
York had, really by all counts, a pretty stellar season. Despite a disappointing end to their season, which saw them removed from the NCAA tournament due to COVID protocols, the University of Michigan had a very strong 2020-21 season, and York was a key piece to their success. He w…]]></summary>

As an overall take, CNET's Scott Stein argues that the "good enough" entry-level ‌iPad‌ actually "covers all the bases best" out of Apple's entire ‌iPad‌ lineup at the moment.



Stein notes that iPads are most often secondary devices and especially popular with families, and pricing on the entry-level ‌iPad‌ makes it a compelling product that offers much of the functionality people are looking for in an ‌iPad‌ without breaking the bank.

Two kits and a large number of item variants
 The Sims 4’s Dream Home Decorator game pack did a lot for players interested in home renovation and design, but a new base game update published Tuesday is, arguably, a much bigger deal.
Developer Maxis added two new kits to The Sims 4: Fashion Street and Incheon Arrivals, inspired by India and South Korea, respectively. Most of the stuff in these kits is available only if players buy them, but Maxis added a new, free base game update, too. And it’s an update that’s been a long time coming — expert Sims builders have been asking for this level of customization for some time now. The Sims 4 art team added around 1,200 new item variants to 149 base game items in Build Mode, publisher Electronic Arts said in an update on The Sims 4 website. To put it simply, 149 items now have a massive selection of different color and pattern swatches, which means that you can make things match in new ways. Curtains! Wood swatches that match! Colorful stoves!
The full list of items is available on The Sims 4 blog. In particular, I’m getting real Ironwood Kitchenette vibes from the new VAULT Modular kitchen set.

It’s not only inside stuff, either: There are new swatches for gardening, as well as plants themselves, plus all 64 base game windows have been updated, too. It’s overwhelming and very exciting — there’s so much room for deeper customization with these additional swatches. Of course, it’s no Create a Style, which let The Sims 3 players fully customize object patterns and colors.
Still, it’s a step closer.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple released iOS 15 on Monday, and in the time since, the software update has reportedly seen lower adoption than iOS 14 following its launch last year.





According to analytics company Mixpanel, around 8.5% of users installed iOS 15 as of Wednesday at 12:00 a.m. Eastern Time, compared to around 14.5% for iOS 14 as of midnight on the second day after that software update was released.



Mixpanel measures iOS adoption based on visits to websites and apps that use its mobile analytics SDKs, so the data is not official. Apple has yet to share iOS 15 adoption stats, having last reported an 85% adoption rate for iOS 14 back in June.



Earlier this year, Apple announced that iPhone users who remain on iOS 14 now have the option to continue receiving important security updates, so this change is likely contributing to iOS 15's lower adoption rate seen by Mixpanel so far.

It’s called Threads of Light
 Fashion is power in Destiny 2, but players are interested in more than just pure stats. Sure, players want armor and other gear that’ll make their characters more powerful — but plenty of players place equal importance on just how dang good they look. Since Destiny, fashionable players have been convening in the /r/DestinyFashion subreddit, where players share their best looks and how they acquired them — a process that sometimes means a major grind.
Destiny 2 developer Bungie has clearly noticed the appeal of a stylish guardian, and to honor that, it’s creating a digital fashion magazine featuring looks from the game. Called Threads of Light, the magazine is for “celebrating [the] community’s creativity and showcasing the best guardian …]]></summary>

The NYT does not believe regular people stand to benefit from
better iPhone photos in the dark. I live for this review from
another planet every year.
I thought this was a really strange passage too. Quoting from Chen’s review:
So in summary, the iPhone 13 cameras are slightly better than
those of last year’s iPhones. Even compared with iPhones from
three years ago, the cameras are much better only if you care
about taking nice photos in the dark.
Just how important is night photography? I posed the question to
Jim Wilson, a longtime staff photographer for The New York Times,
as he was taking pictures of the new iPhones for this review. He

The Flyers have already caught the injury bug before the season begins.
 The Philadelphia Flyers are not starting their season with the best footing. After a summer full of transition and the result being the most shaken-up roster amidst the 32 NHL squads, they announced on Tuesday that they will be dropping the puck on Oct. 15 against the Vancouver Canucks without center Kevin Hayes, as well as depth blueliner Sam Morin, and roster hopeful Wade Allison.
All three of them will be away from the lineup for a significant amount of time – Allison being labelled as “out indefinitely – but the Flyers are purely hoping that the roster that GM Chuck Fletcher spent so much time on during the last few months tinkering with, can be able to withstan…]]></summary>

Freediving is, after all, a lifelong opportunity to radically reshape one’s body and mind in the process. In pursuing depth, humans must train their lungs and brains to unlock secret sources of clarity and strength and oxygen and potential that are hidden within the body. They are secrets that, once revealed, make the divers not just more effective at their craft, they argue, but more effective, conscious, skillful, and thoughtful as human beings. There is a shift in perspective. A global realignment within one’s consciousness.

How did Foerster’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
Similarly to Zayde Wisdom, Foerster was called up to the AHL due to the uncertainty of the OHL season, and equally, Foerster impressed. His goal total of ten ranked him second among Phantoms skaters, and to play so well at only 18 in a professional league speaks volumes for Foerster’s potential.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple's augmented reality headset will enter mass production in the second quarter of next year, with a launch expected between the third and fourth quarter of 2022, according to a translated report from the Taiwanese version of DigiTimes.





In June, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo offered a similar timeline for Apple's AR headset, reporting it will launch sometime between April and June of next year. According to today's report, Apple's AR headset has completed its second phase of prototype testing, inching closer to being ready for primetime mass production.



The first iteration of Apple's AR headset may be a bit bulky in design, similar to the Oculus Rift headset, but a sleeker pair of "Apple Glasses" could launch a few years later. In recent years, Apple has been building up its AR platform, rolling out several AR-centric features on iOS and iPadOS, possibly paving the way for the "‌Apple Glasses‌."



Apple's AR headset isn't expected to be cheap in price, at least at the start. One report says that it will feature at least 15 camera modules, feature eye-tracking, possibly iris recognition, and could cost between $2,000 and $3,000.

Eidos-Montreal’s adventure shines when the bickering misfits huddle up and rally
 The action in Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy isn’t necessarily squad-based or team tactics combat, but there is an order of battle the player must follow, especially for the big set-piece battles. Keep this in mind if you pick up Eidos-Montreal’s take on Marvel’s adventure-dramedy at the end of October: Have a plan, and make choices to advance it. You’re not going to get out of a throwdown simply by telling Rocket to blow everything up.
This is because the Guardians all deal two types of damage: regul…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/22/ipad-mini-shipping-times-november/"/>
        <updated>2021-09-22T11:27:21.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple opened pre-orders for the iPad mini 6 right after last week's "California streaming" event, with first orders arriving this Friday, but anyone who is waiting for the reviews to come in before they order one will likely have a wait on their hands, as estimated delivery times for many variants have since slipped into November in the U.S. and select other countries.





For example, for a 256GB Wi-Fi iPad mini in Pink, Apple's website gives a 3-4 week shipping estimate, while estimates lengthen to 4-6 weeks for the same capacity in Starlight or Purple. Most variants are available in 4-6 weeks, with 3-4 weeks being the earliest delivery estimate.



As with every Apple product launch, it is possible that lengthy delivery estimates are a result of low supply rather than high demand. However, the ‌iPad mini‌ was arguably the standout product in Apple's event, thanks to its 8.3-inch display and chassis redesign in the vein of the iPad Air. 



The new ‌iPad mini‌ is also the only iPad with Apple's latest A15 Bionic chip, and like the iPad Pro, includes a 12-megapixel Ultra Wide front camera enabling Center Stage, so there's good reason for ‌iPad mini‌ fans to be excited again.



Review embargos for the ‌iPad mini 6‌ lift later today, so be sure to check back here on MacRumors for a full reviews roundup.

A flood of users has taken to Twitter over the last 24-48 hours to share their experience that after updating to ‌iOS 15‌, they see an "iPhone Storage Almost Full" warning inside of Settings, despite their ‌iPhone‌ having a sufficient amount of storage left. Apple Support's Twitter account is riddled with users reporting the bug. 




@AppleSupport updated my phone and now under settings it says phone storage almost full. I got to click on it and nothing happens. So I’m stuck with the badge

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *The Flyers dropped a bunch of information about training camp yesterday — training camp starts in less that one week — and also dropped a little nugget about Kevin Hayes requiring a rather major surgery! Oh good! [BSH]
*It’s an abdominal surgery which is going to keep him out for a rather long time. [NBC Sports Philly]
*No two ways about it: this really stinks! [Inquirer]
*It certainly will make training camp more interesting, as this is a rather large gaping hole the Flyers need to fill for the opening night lineup. [The Athletic]
*Hayes is just one on a very long list of pretty notable names that will miss the start of this season due to injury. What the heck is going on here?! [ProHockeyTalk]
*Anyway, in a bit of good news, Oskar Lindblom is full-throttle ready to get back on the ice and back to the player he was before his cancer diagnosis. [Inquirer]
*We’ve cracked the top-10 in the 25 Under 25, and the guy to do it was Bobby Brink. [BSH]
*At number 9, a guy we’d all like to see crack the lineup this season, at least for a little bit. [BSH]
*Related, let’s take a look around the Metro Division and see what the center situation for each team looks like. [Canes Country]
*And finally, remember when Ron Hextall traded Zac Rinaldo for a third round pick? In hindsight, the greatest move of his general management career. [ProHockeyTalk]]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In iOS 15 as well as Safari 15 for macOS Big Sur and macOS Catalina, Apple introduced some Safari interface design changes that haven't been universally welcomed. Fortunately, Apple has made some of these changes optional, such as the ability to disable tab bar coloring. 




Tab bar coloring on (left) versus coloring off (right) in dark mode


Tab bar coloring, or website tinting, happens when the color of Safari's interface changes around the tabs, bookmark, and navigation button areas to match the color of the website you're viewing.



The idea behind tinting is that it allows the browser interface to fade into the background and create a more immersive experience. However, the effect doesn't always look great, especially if you have several windows arranged on your desktop. Happily, Apple chose to include an option to turn it off.


Launch Safari, then select Safari -> Preferences... from the menu bar.



Select the Tabs panel.


Uncheck the box next to Show color in tab bar.


If you're using Safari in ‌iOS 15‌, you can find the same option in Settings -> Safari. Under the "Tabs" section, turn off the switch next to Allow Website Tinting. On iPadOS 15, this option is called Show Color in Tab Bar, just like in Safari 15 for macOS.





In previous versions of iOS, Apple included a "Show Color in Tab Bar" accessibility setting, which basically had the same effect as the new "Allow Website Tinting" toggle. The fact that Apple made the option more prominent suggests user aversion to tinting is more common than previously thought.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brian X. Chen’s review of the new iPhones for The New York Times is the least enthusiastic I’ve seen:
This is all to say the annual phone upgrade, which companies like
Apple and Samsung tout with enormous marketing events and ad
campaigns to gin up sales for the holiday shopping season, has
become a mirage of tech innovation. In reality, the upgrades are
now a celebration of
capitalism
in the form of ruthless incrementalism.
Fair enough, but I found it curious that Chen’s review didn’t contain the word “battery”. The consensus is pretty strong that the two standout features are better cameras and improved battery life.

They’re both time loop murder mystery mashups 
 As I wrapped up my current Deathloop playthrough, I was intensely reminded of a book I had just finished — Stuart Turton’s 2018 murder mystery best-seller The 7½ Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle. If you liked one, you just might like the other.
Though I’m not the first to make this comparison, I found the two echoed one another so closely because they mash up genres in an eerily similar way. Deathloop and The 7½ Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle both combine time loops with murder mysteries — genres that are similarly dense with detail and encourage clue-finding. Plus, each category is enduringly popular on its own. Time loops are a science-fiction trope that’s littered across film, with Grou…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year, Apple debuted support for digital car keys, which let users lock, unlock, and start their vehicles using a pass stored in the Wallet app on the iPhone. And with iOS 15, there's now Ultra Wideband support on the iPhone 11 and later that will let the feature work without having to remove your ‌iPhone‌ from your pocket.





Car manufacturers need to add the NFC technology to their vehicles to support digital car keys, and so far BMW has been the only manufacturer to do so with Apple's platforms.



It appears as if that's about to change, however, as an Apple configuration file specifying various compatibility criteria for Apple Pay NFC functionality has been updated today to add mention of Hyundai's luxury brand Genesis.





We noted earlier this year that BMW was preparing to support the Ultra Wideband version of Apple's digital car key feature and that Hyundai was reportedly moving to adopt digital car keys on ‌iPhone‌ as well, and that now appears to be coming to fruition.



We've yet to see an official announcement from Hyundai or Genesis about launching digital car key support on iOS, but the manufacturer debuted the feature on Android with its 2021 GV80 and G80 models and indicated that it was working with Apple on iOS support.

With videos, gosh, I was really excited about the new Cinematic
mode. Aaaand gosh, was it a let down. The feature — which you
could call “Portrait mode for video” — adds artistic blur
around the object in focus. The coolest thing is that you can
tap to refocus while you shoot (and even do it afterward in the
Photos app).
Except, as you can see in my video, the software struggles to know
where objects begin and end. It’s a lot like the early days of
Portrait Mode, but it’s worse because now the blur moves and
warps. I shot footage where the software lost parts of noses and
fingers, and struggled with items such as a phone or camera. The
Apple spokeswoman said Cinematic mode is a “breakthrough
innovation that will keep getting better over time.”
Stern went all-in on Cinematic mode for the video accompanying her review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Raymond Wong shot a bunch of great camera comparison for his Input review. He was annoyed by the same jarring automatic switch between the 1× to 0.5× lens when entering or leaving macro mode that I mentioned in my review:
I welcome greater detail for close-ups and it’s clever that Apple
is using the ultra-wide to augment the 1× wide and 3× telephoto at
short distances, but the transitioning of cameras is disorienting.
Apple makes no mention of this camera switching/augmenting on its
iPhone 13 Pro website. I get that it’s supposed to be one of those
“it just works” features. At least that was Apple’s intention I’m
told, but it just doesn’t.
Here’s a screen recording of the automatic camera switching in
action. In this shot, I was trying to frame these delicious soup
dumplings using the grid. Holding the iPhone 13 Pro still, you can
see the 1× wide switching to another slightly different FOV that’s
using the ultra-wide autofocusing. The viewfinder keeps jittering
as it tries to choose between a regular wide or wide-macro shot. A
regular person wouldn’t look at this and think to themselves, this
is normal. They’d look at the jittering and think something is
broken with their iPhone camera. The framing should never change
from what you compose and never automatically.
Wong’s screen recording illustrates the issue perfectly.
When I first pressed Apple and made them aware of the jarring
camera switching, I was told it’s how the camera system works. On
the eve of this review, Apple changed course and said it’s going
to release a software update to let users disable the camera
switching. According to Apple:
A new setting will be added in a software update this fall to turn
off automatic camera switching when shooting at close distances
for macro photography and video.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Matthew Panzarino, writing for TechCrunch, regarding Cinematic video mode:
I did some test shooting with my kids walking through crowds and
riding on carousels that was genuinely, shockingly good. It really
does provide a filmic, dreamy quality to the video that I was
previously only able to get with quick and continuous focus
adjustments on an SLR shooting video with a manually focused lens.
That, I think, is the major key to understanding Cinematic Mode.
Despite the marketing, this mode is intended to unlock new
creative possibilities for the vast majority of iPhone users who
have no idea how to set focal distances, bend their knees to
stabilize and crouch-walk-rack-focus their way to these kinds of
tracking shots. It really does open up a big bucket that was just
inaccessible before. And in many cases I think that those willing
to experiment and deal with its near-term foibles will be
rewarded with some great looking shots to add to their iPhone
memories widget.
That sounds right to me.

        <updated>2021-09-21T20:28:32.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dieter Bohn, writing for The Verge:
Apple’s marketing for the camera system on the 13 Pro is that it’s
the “biggest advancement ever.” I don’t know that I would go that
far, but I also can’t remember the last time I’ve said “whoa, look
at this photo” as many times as I have during this review. […]
Where the Pro 13 camera system shines is in low light. The main
wide-angle sensor has seen a massive upgrade this year. Unlike
Android phones that are chasing big megapixel counts and then
“pixel binning” to achieve low light performance, Apple is
sticking with 12 megapixels, the same resolution it’s used since
2015’s iPhone 6S. The sensor itself is much bigger now and
features 1.9 µm pixels, which are about as big as anything we’ve
seen on a smartphone. And on top of all that, the lens now has an
ƒ/1.5 aperture.
All of that adds up to a camera that can very quickly take in a
massive amount of light relative to other phones. Combined with
some tuning and improvements to Apple’s computational photography,
the low light performance on the 13 Pro is simply second to none.
I came away super impressed with the low light performance of the 13 Pro, too.
Bohn makes an important point in his corresponding review of the 13 and 13 Mini too: because the camera bumps are all new sizes, cases for the iPhone 13 won’t fit the 13 Pro, nor vice-versa.

Focus Mode is handy because it lets you decide exactly what alerts and apps you want to see at home, while at work, when sleeping, when exercising, and in other situations, but as Reddit users have pointed out, Apple has dropped a key Do Not Disturb feature.



Do Not Disturb in ‌iOS 14‌ had a setting that allowed incoming calls and notifications to be silenced at all times, or only when the iPhone was locked. With this setting, you could turn on Do Not Disturb but still get all of your calls and notifications if you unlocked your phone and were actively using it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alongside the iOS 15.1 beta, Apple has also introduced a HomePod 15.1 beta that brings Lossless and Dolby Atmos Spatial Audio support to the ‌HomePod‌ and the HomePod mini.





The ‌HomePod‌ beta software is invite only and is not provided to developers for testing purposes, but 9to5Mac was able to confirm that Lossless and Spatial Audio support are included in the beta.



Apple added Dolby Atmos with Spatial Audio and Lossless support to iOS and Mac devices in May, but promised that the feature would be coming to the ‌HomePod‌ and ‌HomePod mini‌ at a later time.



Lossless Audio and Dolby Atmos can be enabled through the Home app. Open up Home Settings, tap on your profile, and then under Media, tap on Apple Music. From there, toggle on Lossless Audio and Dolby Atmos. Note that these options appear in the iOS 15.1 beta, but the ‌HomePod‌ 15.1 beta seems to be needed to actually use the features on the ‌HomePod‌.



If all goes well, these features should launch with the ‌HomePod‌ 15.1 software that is set to be released alongside iOS 15.1. Since the iOS 15.1 was just provided to developers today, we likely have several weeks of testing to go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a day after releasing the iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 updates, Apple has already seeded the first betas of iOS 15.1 and iPadOS 15.1. The new updates reintroduce features like SharePlay, and below, we have a list of what's new.





SharePlay


SharePlay is enabled in the iOS 15.1, iPadOS 15.1, and tvOS 15.1 betas to allow Apple to further work out bugs to get the feature ready to launch. Apple decided to pull SharePlay from the ‌iOS 15‌ launch because it was not properly functioning and was still riddled with issues.





Available in FaceTime, SharePlay is designed to let users call up their friends and family and then watch TV, watch movies, and listen to music together using neat features like shared playlists and TV show syncing for all users. SharePlay also allows for screen sharing.



If testing goes well, SharePlay could see an official launch in iOS 15.1.



Announce Calls


In the Settings for the Phone app, there's a new icon for the "Announce Calls" setting.





Lossless Audio for HomePod


The HomePod 15.1 beta that accompanies the iOS 15.1 beta adds Lossless Audio and Dolby Atmos with Spatial Audio support to the HomePod and HomePod mini.



Vaccine Cards in Wallet


In ‌iOS 15‌, verifiable health records can be downloaded and stored in the Health app, and this includes COVID-19 vaccination records and health results. In iOS 15.1, vaccination records are able to be added to the Wallet app so a vaccine card can be provided to businesses, restaurants, venues, and more where vaccines are required for entry.



See our previous article for more details and discussion. Discussion should be limited to the ‌iOS 15‌ update and political comments will be immediately removed. 



Other Features


Know of a feature that we left out? Let us know in the comments.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple Newsroom, back on August 30:
Primephonic is no longer available for new subscribers and will be
taken offline beginning September 7. Apple Music plans to launch a
dedicated classical music app next year combining Primephonic’s
classical user interface that fans have grown to love with more
added features. In the meantime, current Primephonic subscribers
will receive six months of Apple Music for free, providing access
to hundreds of thousands of classical albums, all in Lossless and
high-resolution audio, as well as hundreds of classical albums in
Apple Music’s Spatial Audio, with new albums added regularly.
I’ve had this flagged for a few weeks. What I find interesting is Apple is going to use this acquisition to launch a dedicated classical music app, not to expand the Music app. iTunes, infamously, expanded greatly over the years, and everyone seems to agree that the user experience suffered for it. I wonder if that’s in the back of Apple’s mind here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The iOS 15.1 beta that was introduced today allows iPhone users to upload their COVID-19 vaccination status to the Health app and then generate a vaccination card in Apple Wallet.





The Apple Wallet vaccination card can be shown to businesses, venues, restaurants, and more that are requiring vaccines for entry.



As outlined in an announcement to developers, verifiable health records are based on the SMART Health Cards specification. California is using SMART Health Cards, so users in California can add their vaccination records to the Wallet app after installing iOS 15.1.



Other states and health organizations that use the SMART Health Cards will be able to use a button to let users know that they can download and store their vaccination information in the Health app and in the Wallet app. 



California, Louisiana, New York, Virginia, Hawaii, and some Maryland counties support Smart Health Cards, as do Walmart, Sam's Club, and CVS Health. So those in the specific supported states should be able to look up their information in state databases, but those who were vaccinated through companies like Walmart and CVS will also be able to add their information to the Health and Wallet apps because it's the same system. 



Note that some apps like the one used by the NHS in the UK allowed users to add their vaccination records to the Wallet app, but the new solution is a universal standard that will work for all healthcare providers/states that implement it. 



Discussion should be limited to the app and implementation, and not politics.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the next two weeks, L’Arc de Triomphe in Paris will be wrapped, an installation that realizes a project begun by the late husband and wife team Christo and Jeanne-Claude in 1961.
L’Arc de Triomphe, Wrapped, a temporary artwork for Paris, is on view for 16 days from Saturday, September 18 to Sunday, October 3, 2021. The project has been realized in partnership with the Centre des Monuments Nationaux and in coordination with the City of Paris. It also receives the support of the Centre Pompidou. The Arc de Triomphe is wrapped in 25,000 square meters of recyclable polypropylene fabric in silvery blue, and with 3,000 meters of red rope.
In 1961, three years after they met in Paris, Christo and Jeanne-Claude began creating works of art in public spaces. One of their projects was to wrap a public building. When he arrived in Paris, Christo rented a small room near the Arc de Triomphe and had been attracted by the monument ever since. In 1962, he made a photomontage of the Arc de Triomphe wrapped, seen from the Avenue Foch and, in 1988, a collage. 60 years later, the project will finally be concretized.


Jeanne-Claude died in 2009 and Christo followed in 2020, so the project was completed by their team according to their wishes. I would have liked to have seen this in person…The Gates in NYC were wonderful.

Arkane’s latest hotfix should make the PC frame rate a little smoother
 Deathloop is getting praise from just about everyone who plays it, but the PC version has a few problems. The worst of these is a camera stutter that happens just about every time players move their mouse. It’s an extremely frustrating issue, but one that Arkane hopes to have fixed with a new patch released on Tuesday. 
According to the patch notes that Arkane released with the new update, Tuesday’s hotfix aims to address issues that PC players have had where “mouse-based camera movements could result in the appearance of ‘stutter.’” That’s a lot of qualifiers to parse, but it seems like Arkane is saying that these aren’t actually frame rate stutters, they just have the “appearance” of them. Whatever the problem was, hopefully this patch makes it feel a little better.
While the camera problem might be solved, it isn’t the only problem with Deathloop’s PC port. Arkane also explains in the patch notes that it’s looking into other problems as well. For instance, when you play Deathloop at an extremely high frame rate, the game also encounters a stutter. In our experience the game became nearly unplayable at 240 fps thanks to this issue, but it was fine when locked at 140 fps. In Tuesday’s patch notes, Arkane said that it thinks it’s identified the problem and will update players when it has more information. 
Even if there are still a few problems, the good news is Arkane seems to be working on them and trying to make the PC port as smooth as possible for players.]]></summary>

Testing SharePlay no longer requires the SharePlay Development Profile to get it to work, but those who want to use it on macOS Monterey will still need to use the SharePlay profile and will need to update to the newly released ‌macOS Monterey‌ beta.





SharePlay is a FaceTime feature that's designed to allow users to watch movies and listen to music with their friends and family on ‌FaceTime‌ calls, and it also has a screensharing component.



SharePlay was functional for the early part of iOS 15 testing prior to ‌iOS 15‌'s release, but Apple ended up pulling it because it was buggy and there wasn't time to get it ready for release. Apple said it would be released in a future update.

A great game with a multiplayer add-on that’s just okay
 Deathloop is a fantastic game, but there’s one element that’s just kind of there — the player versus player combat. 
Every time I start Deathloop, I’m given an option. I can either try to break the loop as Colt, or protect it as Julianna. This is an intriguing premise. While the game’s other antagonists are all locked into the same routines and schedules, Julianna is free of the cycle; she’s controlled by a human player I cannot predict and sometimes cannot outplay. But the execution of this executioner is just so-so, and it stands out like a useless appendage in an otherwise spectacular experience.
When playing as Colt, you can toggle the possibility of Julianna invasions on and off.…]]></summary>

Suddenly, everything is happening. 
 Just like that, training camp is upon us! The Flyers are set to be back on the ice starting on Thursday. We’ll see them broken up into three groups for regular on-ice sessions for the first three days of camp, and then they’ll add a couple of scrimmages on top of those sessions on Sunday and Monday, ahead of Tuesday’s preseason kickoff against the Islanders. 
You can find the full schedule for here, and the full roster for camp can be found here. 
The Flyers have also announced the following injury updates:
Kevin Hayes (abdominal surgery on 9/21 - out 6-8 weeks)
Samuel Morin (right knee surgery to have loose bodies removed on 9/10 - out 6-8 weeks)
Wade Allison (right ankle sprain - out indefinitely)
Zayde Wisdom (shoulder surgery - out indefinitely)
Cooper Zech (upper body - out 6-8 weeks)
Not all of this is surprising: we knew that Wisdom would be out for a while, and there had been rumors about Morin’s status kicking around for the last little bit here. But there are a few takeaways. The ankle injury for Allison is still not great, but considering how ugly the play he was injured on looked, and the knee issues he’s had in the past, an ankle injury feels like a bit of a bullet dodged, all things considered. 
The Hayes news is the big surprise, and that certainly complicates things. The Flyers’ center situation heading into camp already looked to be a bit up in the air, and a lot was going to depend on those battles in camp to solidify those positions, and now they seem to be even more wide open. With Hayes out (and to a degree, Allison as well) this certainly opens up the door for some prospects like Morgan Frost and Tanner Laczynski, who have been impressing in development and rookie camps, to push hard for a spot, and reasonably grab one. 
Things are getting really interesting around here, and while it feels like we say this every year, this camp is going to be one to keep an eye on.]]></summary>

The game is still best played in multiplayer
 MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries is still a bit of a mess, even with the new Legend of the Kestrel Lancers expansion. The new DLC succeeds in eliminating the early-game grind, mainly by throwing in-game money at the problem. But nothing seems able to stop the overwhelming stupidity of its friendly AI.
Kestrel Lancers kicks off with a series of wargames which, fitting nicely with the overall lore of the BattleTech universe, are actually live-fire field exercises. Damage coverage — cash that you use to repair your Mechs after a battle — is upped to 10 million credits, an order of magnitude more than the compensation meted out in the base game’s early missions. This allowed me to use my arsenal of big stompy robots for some…]]></summary>

How did Zamula’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
Zamula logged 25 games in his professional debut with the Phantoms in Lehigh Valley and then two games with the Flyers later in the season as they were eliminated from Stanley Cup playoff contention. In those games, Zamula went scoreless in the NHL, but he registered six assists in 25 AHL contests to put a bow on a very strange season — but one in which …]]></summary>

Developed by Ludosity and Fair Play Labs, Nickelodeon’s spin on a Super Smash Bros.-style fighting game will feature familiar faces like SpongeBob SquarePants and Patrick Star, along with some of Nicktoon’s most popular characters. And with the introduction of so many unconventional fighters comes the opportunity for new ones to enter the fighting arena, including April O’Neil, a star of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

How did Brink’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
It was a weird season for everyone in some regard, but it was a particularly weird season for Brink. For starters, he really didn’t play that much—with being away for the World Juniors pre-tournament camp and the tournament itself, he only played 15 games for Denver, and then those seven World Junior games for the US. But, limited as his play might have been, it wasn’t a poor season. Denver struggled quite a bit…]]></summary>

Back to this image, this was captured through a telescope and involved capturing thousands of frames to reveal the details. But what about the colors? The moon is gray, of course, but not *perfectly* gray. Some areas have a subtle blue tint, and others have a more orange tint. By teasing out those subtle colors, I can reveal the mineral composition of the moon! Blues denote titanium presence, while orange shows iron and feldspar present in the regolith. You can also see how impacts paint the surface with fresh color in the ejecta as they churn up material.


A print is available, but only for a very limited time (~6 more hours as of pub time).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple has begun selling iPhones on its Certified Refurbished online store in Canada, offering residents in the country a more affordable way to purchase iPhones from Apple online.





Apple has been selling different refurbished iPhone models in the United States online since 2016. While Apple has long offered iPads and Macs in its Canadian refurbished store, this is the first time customers in the country have been able to benefit from the discounts that come with buying an Apple refurbished smartphone. 



Previously, customers in Canada who wanted lower prices on iPhones had to wait for third-party deals or purchase refurbished/used devices from a third-party retailer, but with Apple's highly regarded refurbishment process now an option for iPhones too, this should come as a welcome development.



All of Apple's refurbished products, ‌iPhone‌ included, are tested, certified, cleaned, and guaranteed with a one-year warranty. iPhones also feature a brand new battery and a fresh outer shell, ensuring there are no scratches or other cosmetic damage.



Customers in Canada can currently choose from a variety of refurbished recent ‌iPhone‌ models in various finishes and capacities, including ‌iPhone‌ XS, XS Max, 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max, with up to CAD$560 off the regular price currently on offer. With the iPhone 13 lineup about to drop into consumers' hands, expect iPhone 12 models to be included in Apple's refurbished listings soon.



(Thanks, Anthony!)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today launched a new offer that provides owners of the second-generation AirPods, AirPods Pro, AirPods Max, and select Beats products with a six-month free subscription to Apple Music.





The offer is only valid for new ‌Apple Music‌ subscribers, and no new purchase is required, so this is open to any users who currently own an eligible product. Eligible products include the second-generation ‌AirPods‌ (with wired or wireless case), ‌AirPods Pro‌, ‌AirPods Max‌, Beats Studio Buds, Powerbeats, Powerbeats Pro, and Beats Solo Pro. Eligible users will see a prompt in the ‌Apple Music‌ app for their six-month free offer.



The offer must be claimed within 90 days from when users first connect their eligible ‌AirPods‌ or Beats product to an Apple device after September 20 to take up the offer.



Apple emphasizes that customers must be on the latest iOS and iPadOS versions to see the offer, which as of yesterday, is iOS and iPadOS 15. The new offer is a notable package from Apple, as it's not often the company has bundled the purchase of its ‌AirPods‌ or Beats products with its ‌Apple Music‌ service.



More information about the offer can be found on Apple's website.



Update: This article has been updated to clarify that no new purchase of an ‌AirPods‌ or Beats product is required. Customers who previously purchased an eligible product are also able to take advantage of the offer.

You’ve played this game before
 I’m in the midst of another forest meadow. It would be picturesque if not for all the gnarled purple roots strangling the life out of the place, and the fleshy bulbs pulsating a toxic red. As Kena, a spirit guide who travels the land seeking to reunite the dead, usher spirits to the afterlife, and generally put things right, my top priorities are the forested valley and its health. For the most part, this means eliminating all those red nodules that blight the land.
For what’s ostensibly an indie game made by an animation studio crossing over to the realm of video games for the first time, Kena: Bridge of Spirits is a surprisingly slick affair. Movement is swift, platforming is non-aggravating, and the third-person combat is dancel…]]></summary>

Tapping on this prompt encourages users to make sure that iCloud syncing is enabled for all of their apps for a complete ‌iCloud‌ backup, offering up an option to turn on syncing for any app that doesn't have it on.



The feature also explains how to use an existing ‌iPhone‌ to set up a new ‌iPhone‌ for a quick sign in process, and it offers up details on finding out how much an existing ‌iPhone‌ is worth for trade-in purposes.



Apple is likely showing this information based on Apple ID, so many customers who pre-ordered an ‌iPhone‌ may be seeing the new popup. For those who want to get rid of it, just tapping through the prompts should be enough to get it to disappear.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the release of iOS and iPadOS 15 today, the popular password management app 1Password has released an accompanying update that brings its desktop-class extension to the iPhone and iPad.





With iOS and ‌iPadOS 15‌, Apple allows Safari extensions developers to release their previously exclusive Safari for Mac extensions to the ‌iPhone‌ and ‌iPad‌, allowing users to use extensions on all of their devices. 1Password was one of the first to tease support earlier in June, and with its latest App Store update today, it's bringing it to all users. 



With its Safari extension on ‌iPhone‌ and ‌iPad‌, 1Password users now have immediate access to all their passwords and 1Password entries right inside of Safari, including in-page suggestions. 1Password for Safari uses on-device machine learning to automatically fill in the login process of complicated websites and even automatically fills in two-factor authentication codes.



On ‌iPadOS 15‌, 1Password's extension is even more feature-rich, featuring a complete in-Safari user interface that "turbocharges any ‌iPad‌."  1Password along with its Safari extension is introducing other app improvements and bug fixes. Users can learn more about 1Password's announcement over on its blog.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today updated iMovie and Clips with support for several new features that are set to be introduced alongside the iPhone 13 models.







iMovie now supports Cinematic Mode and can be used to add, adjust, and delete focus points and modify the depth of field effect in Cinematic Mode video. Cinematic Mode is a feature that's available on all of the ‌iPhone 13‌ models, but footage can be edited on the iPhone XS or later, iPad mini 5 or later iPad Air 3 or later, and all iPad Pro models.



The update also includes the option to add ProRAW images to movies and trailers, and options to import and edit ProRes video.



ProRes video is a feature coming to the iPhone 13 Pro models later this year, and it will allow the devices to record in the ProRes format. ProRes video can be captured with an ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ when the feature launches and it will be able to be edited on the ‌iPhone 13‌, iPad mini 6, and ‌iPad Pro‌ models.



As for Clips, Cinematic Mode video can now be imported and edited in the app. Filters, stickers, and emoji can be added to video recorded in Cinematic Mode, and ProRAW images can be added to videos. When ProRes video launches, it will also be able to be imported into Clips and edited directly in the app.



Today's update also adds the option to add photos or videos from the Photos library with a single tap, without having to record each one into a project.



iMovie and Clips can both be downloaded from the App Store for free.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alongside the launch of iOS 15, iPadOS 15, tvOS 15, and watchOS 8, Apple has also pushed an update for its iCloud.com website, introducing a new look for iCloud Mail that's viewed on the web.





The new web-based ‌iCloud‌ Mail design looks similar to the Mail apps on devices running ‌iOS 15‌, ‌iPadOS 15‌, and the beta version of macOS Monterey. It is a cleaner and more streamlined look than the prior ‌iCloud‌ Mail app for the web, but the functionality is largely the same.



Colors are lighter, the font has been updated, and there's a new smaller compose window for writing emails that takes up less space.



Apple introduced the new ‌iCloud‌ Mail design for the web during the ‌iOS 15‌ beta testing process and it was previously limited to the beta.icloud.com site, but it has now been released for the main iCloud.com website.



Apple today also made the Hide My Email and Custom Email Domain features live on the main iCloud.com site. Hide My Email is designed to allow users to create throwaway emails that forward to a main email address. With this feature, users can create different email addresses for different websites and then disable them if spam emails ever start arriving.





Custom Email Domains are designed to allow customers to use their own custom email addresses with the ‌iCloud‌ Mail feature. Domain records need to be updated with Apple's settings, so access to the domain's registrar is required.





All of these new features can be accessed by logging into the iCloud.com website. The Custom Email Domain and Hide My Email features can be accessed by clicking on your name and choosing "Settings."

Apple says that this issue has been resolved through improvements to the Face ID feature, which is available on the ‌iPhone‌ X, iPhone XR, ‌iPhone‌ XS (all models), iPhone 11 (all models), iPhone 12 (all models), ‌iPad Pro‌ (11-inch), and ‌iPad Pro‌ (3rd generation).



There are a number of other security fixes included in the ‌iOS 15‌ update, but none of the exploits were listed as being used in the wild. There was an issue with the Neural Engine that could allow an application to execute arbitrary code with system privileges on devices with a Neural Engine, and a CoreML bug could let attackers cause unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution.



Apple also addressed issues with FontParser, Preferences, Siri, WebKit, and WiFi, all of which are outlined in Apple's full security document.



For those not particularly interested in the feature set that ‌iOS 15‌ offers, it may still be a good idea to upgrade just to get the full suite of security fixes that Apple has deployed.

“I didn’t leave because I was running away from anything. I left because I felt I could be more myself in Japan.”
“Living in Japan, as an African-American, I’ve honestly never felt more free.”
“You know, I can do things here in Japan that I can’t do back at home, in the U.S.”
“I can catch a cab when I’m not trying to catch a cab. People in stores that are supposed to serve you, serve you, like they serve everybody else.”

The kids are alright, etc etc. 
 At long last, we had a bit of hockey to watch this weekend! Ahead of training camp opening up this week, the Flyers had their rookie camp last week, which they closed out with a pair of scrimmages against the Rangers’ rookies. The Flyers’ prospects split that series, taking home a 6-3 win on Saturday, and then dropping Sunday’s matchup 3-2. And while that’s all good to know, we’re a little less fussed on the outcomes of the games than we are concerned, more generally, about just how the prospects looked. So, all of that said, let’s take a look at some of the standout performances, shall we?

Safari 15 introduces a new look for Safari with rounded, more defined tabs and support for transparency, a compact tab bar option that can be toggled on or off, and Tab Groups. Apple's notes for the update are below:
Safari 15 delivers faster performance, improved security, and the following new features:

- Tab Groups help you save and organize your tabs and easily access them across devices

- Redesigned tabs have a rounder and more defined appearance and take on the color of the webpage

- Compact tab bar option shows more of your web page on screen

- HTTPS upgrade automatically switches sites from HTTP to more secure HTTPS when available




Safari 15 can be downloaded by opening up the System Preferences interface and selecting the Software Update option. There is no word yet on when ‌macOS Monterey‌ will be released, but it could come in October alongside new Macs as Apple is expected to hold a Mac-centric event this fall to debut new 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro models.

 Relishing in the details of game development helps me build an appreciation for both the worlds of games and the people who make them. This includes environmental design I normally take for granted, like a game’s day-to-night cycle. While time of day can often influence how I play a game, I rarely stop and pause to appreciate that my game world is constantly changing. So, when developer Sørb posted a video showing off the landscape as it changes from a bright blue to golden hour, it didn’t just show me how beautiful that game is, but how lucky we are that any game has any sunset at all.

Plunder shrines, kill coral beasts, get rich
 We knew that Sea of Thieves newest season would send pirates beneath the waves, but now Rare has revealed more details behind the game’s next update. Siren Shrines and Treasuries are arriving to the Sea of Thieves, and players will be able to either track them on their boat’s map, or look for the telltale shimmer of siren treasure on the surface of the water. The reward, of course, is tons of treasure.
Some underwater enemies were introduced during the previous season, A Pirate’s Life, which included a crossover with Disney’s Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. They play a much bigger role in season 4. Siren shrines seem to have a lot in common with the above-water fort, except instead of skeletons, players have to work their way through waves of sirens, coral beasts, and other threats. They also have to solve puzzles to get to the final wave of treasure. 
Luckily, helpful mermaids will help pirates transport their loot to the surface in one go, so you don’t have to worry about the long trip back and forth with all of your coral-encrusted treasure. Coral-encrusted bottles have washed up on the shores, which give the player voyages into the Sunken Kingdom in order to find the Breath of the Sea. This mysterious potion sells and gives rep to the training companies.
Pirates can earn special coral-related cosmetics, like a ship set, scars, and even a curse by completing the new Sunken Kingdom. There’s also a Plunder Pass, which is free and offers 100 free levels of gear and currencies. An updated Plunder Pass grants some extra cosmetics for interested players.
Sea of Thieves’ new season is planned to launch on Sept. 23, and is a free addition to the game. The Sunken Kingdom content will remain in the game for players to explore, while the Plunder Pass is limited to the three-month duration of this season.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re talking about the origins of rock & roll, Sister Rosetta Tharpe has to be included in those conversations. Her early fusion of gospel, the blues, and the electric guitar (as on 1944’s Strange Things Happening Every Day, a contender for the first rock & roll record) had a huge influence on men like Little Richard, Chuck Berry, and Elvis Presley, who ended up winning much of the credit for this innovation. This 60-minute BBC documentary from 2011 is a good place to start learning about Tharpe — part 1 is embedded above and here are parts two, three, and four.
I found this via Ted Mills at Open Culture, who writes:
As the doc makes clear, Tharpe had a rebellious streak, didn’t do what she was told, and pushed boundaries in a very segregated America. She invited the all-white Jordanaires to tour with her, surprising house managers and booking agents alike. And she carried on a love affair and creative partnership with fellow gospel singer Marie Knight for decades, very much on the down low.
So perhaps this is the reason Tharpe has not been on our collective radar — we’ve been slow to admit that rock guitar was created by a queer black woman devoted to the Lord.


And if you want to see the whole clip of Tharpe performing Didn’t It Rain from the opening scene of the documentary, there’s really not a better way to spend eight minutes (bc you’ll probably want to watch it twice):

Damn.

The ‌HomePod‌ 15 software update introduces several new features that are designed to work in tandem with tvOS and iOS. 
- Select a single or pair of HomePod mini as the default speakers for your Apple TV 4K for rich room-filling sound and clear dialogue. 

- Media playback controls automatically appear on your iPhone’s Lock Screen when a HomePod mini playing music is nearby

- Set a lower bass level to enjoy music without disturbing the neighbors

- Ask Siri to turn on your Apple TV, start playing a favorite movie, and control playback while you watch

- Siri automatically adjusts its speaking level based on the room environment and volume of the user

- Ask Siri to control smart home devices at a specific time like turning off the lights in 10 minutes

- Extend access to HomePod throughout your home by enabling Siri voice control on compatible HomeKit accessories

- Support for package detection with HomeKit Secure Video
‌‌‌‌‌‌HomePod‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ software is installed automatically on the ‌‌‌‌‌‌‌HomePod‌‌‌ unless the feature is disabled‌‌‌‌, but the ‌‌‌‌‌‌‌HomePod‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ can also be manually updated in the Home app by following the instructions in our HomePod‌‌ update how to.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today released tvOS 15, the newest version of the tvOS operating system designed for the Apple TV 4K and the ‌Apple TV‌ HD.





The tvOS 15 update can be downloaded over the air through the Settings app on the ‌‌‌Apple TV‌‌‌ by going to System -> Software Update. ‌‌‌Apple TV‌‌‌ owners who have automatic software updates turned on will be upgraded to ‌tvOS 15 automatically.



Apple's tvOS updates are never as grand as its iOS updates, but tvOS 15 does introduce a few notable new features.



A new "Shared With You" section in tvOS will aggregate any content that people have recommended to you through the Messages app so you can check them out at your convenience.



When you use the ‌Apple TV‌ with your AirPods Pro or AirPods Max, there's now support for spatial audio for a theater-like surround sound experience. There's also a new feature for automatically connecting your AirPods through Smart ‌AirPods‌ routing.



Using Hey Siri commands, you can launch Apple TV+ shows in tvOS 15, and two HomePod mini speakers can now be paired with an ‌Apple TV‌ 4K for surround sound. Those with HomeKit cameras can view multiple cameras at the same time on the ‌Apple TV‌.



When the SharePlay FaceTime feature launches later this year, the option that allows multiple people to watch TV shows or movies together will integrate with tvOS. There's even a new "For All of You" recommendation engine that will suggest content everyone might enjoy.



For more on tvOS 15 and the ‌Apple TV‌, we have a dedicated roundup that outlines the new features. Apple has also released a 8.4.6 update for older ‌Apple TV‌ devices.

How did Ersson’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
The numbers don’t end up looking terribly inspiring—they’re good but not absolutely stellar—but we can still come away from this season feeling really good about what Ersson was able to accomplish. And context is important here too. Brynäs were the worst playdriving team in the SHL, with a 43.93 CF% on the season, and gave up the most shots on goal (1702, 32.73 per game average), so Ersson was facing a much heavier workload on a nightly b…]]></summary>

In a research note seen by MacRumors, Kuo said that while he previously predicted that Apple would launch its first iPhones with under-screen Touch ID in the second half of 2022, he now expects the devices to be released in the second half of 2023 due to slower than expected progress with development. Likewise, Kuo now expects Apple's first foldable iPhone to launch in 2024, compared to 2023 previously.



Kuo did not provide any further details, including which iPhone models might gain an under-screen fingerprint sensor. It's likely that under-screen Touch ID would complement Face ID, providing users with multiple biometric authentication options.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a few days after iPhone 13 pre-orders began, well-known Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is looking ahead. In a research note seen by MacRumors, Kuo shared some of his key hardware expectations for next year's tentatively named iPhone 14 Pro models, including a hole-punch display and a 48-megapixel Wide lens for the rear camera system.





A hole-punch design refers to a display with only a small circular cutout for the front camera, as seen on many recent Samsung smartphones. This design would result in the notch being removed, with Face ID sensors likely moved under the display. Kuo said Apple is also working on iPhones with under-screen Touch ID for release in 2023.



As for the rear camera, the 48-megapixel Wide lens would be an upgrade from the 12-megapixel Wide lens on iPhone 13 Pro models.



Apple is expected to release the iPhone 14 lineup in the second half of 2022, in line with usual launch timing. Kuo also reiterated that Apple plans to release a third-generation iPhone SE with 5G support in the first half of 2022. 



In line with research shared by Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty this morning, Kuo said pre-orders for the iPhone 13 series have been higher than iPhone 12 series, particularly for the higher-end Pro models.

A revamp for Summoner and lots of new shiny things for everyone else!
 The Final Fantasy 14 development team detailed some new features for the upcoming expansion, Endwalker, focusing on changes to the various jobs, in a Friday evening livestream.
The developer noted that changes to jobs will expand upon the systems built in the Shadowbringers expansion, rather than create new systems. As the game gets more complex and jobs can hit higher levels, the developer does not want to make jobs overly confusing.
As expected, most jobs are getting additional actions to flesh out combos and add fancy new gauges and resources to use as you fight.
There are several big quality-of-life changes, like ranged attacks from tanks not breaking their weaponskill combos. Lots of job…]]></summary>

Taylor would know because he predicted it. He wrote a remarkable little book back in 2019 called “The Psychology of Pandemics.” Its premise is that pandemics are “not simply events in which some harmful microbe ‘goes viral,’” but rather are mass psychological phenomena about the behaviors, attitudes and emotions of people.

The Phantoms head coach had something to say about an intriguing prospect.
 Morgan Frost has sort of been the forgotten Philadelphia Flyers prospect. Whether it was more focus drawn on the big-league team and their fortunes and misfortunes, or the season he mostly lost due to injury, no one has really thought of him as a sure-thing to contribute to this team. Well, until Lehigh Valley Phantoms head coach Ian Laperriere ranted and raved about the kid after Sunday’s rookie showcase game.
The massive individual narrative coming into the prospect camp for Frost was whether or not he can demonstrate his work from the summer at getting to that NHL level of physicality. And he has already gotten questions about it from his teammates, so the Pha…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While it has been many years since Apple stopped providing first weekend sales numbers for new iPhones, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty today said that iPhone 13 Pro pre-orders are "off to a promising start" with "strong early demand."





Huberty based her opinion off of Apple's delivery estimates for iPhones, which she has been tracking for many years. Shortly after pre-orders began last Friday, delivery estimates for the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max began slipping into October, with Huberty having calculated the average lead time at around 27 days. She said this is the second longest lead time on the first day of pre-orders amongst all iPhone models launched over the past five years, surpassed only by the iPhone X in 2017.



As of last Friday, Huberty said the iPhone 13 mini was faring better with a lead time of 3.1 days, while the standard iPhone 13 faced no delays.



As with every iPhone launch, it is possible that lengthy delivery estimates are a function of low supply rather than high demand, but Huberty said Morgan Stanley's supply chain checks indicate minimal near-term component headwinds for iPhones and concluded that these long lead times "are at least partly a function of strong early demand." 



All four iPhone 13 models will begin arriving to customers and launch in stores on Friday, September 24. Key features across the iPhone 13 lineup include a faster A15 Bionic chip, camera improvements, longer battery life, and a smaller notch. The two Pro models also feature a ProMotion display with a variable refresh rate up to 120Hz.

You’ll also need to buy it 
 Deltarune creator Toby Fox aims to release the next three chapters of his sequel to Undertale  — Deltarune Chapters 3, 4, and 5 — all at once, Fox shared in an update. Instead of just getting Chapter 3, like we have have for Chapter 1 and 2, he will release three together, up to Chapter 5. Fox said he will then put the game up for sale, though he did not list a price.
Deltarune Chapter 1 was released back in 2018, and Chapter 2 got a surprise release on Sept. 17. 
“The world has been really tough for everybody recently. So I decided to release DELTARUNE Chapter 2 for free,” Fox said. Seven chapters in total are expected, according to the Deltarune website at the time of publication.
Fox hasn’t settled on a price yet, but said that the full game will cost more than Undertale. The creator encouraged fans to spend the money they saved by downloading Chapter 2 for free by supporting other indie developers. 
Fox said he had originally planned to release chapters together once they were all finished, but noted that it’s “hard both for creators and fans to go a long time without a release.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dr. Alan Braid, a practicing OB/GYN in the state of Texas for 45 years, explains why he provided medical care in the form of an abortion to a woman in violation of the state’s absurd and dangerous new law.
A new Texas law, known as S.B. 8, virtually banned any abortion beyond about the sixth week of pregnancy. It shut down about 80 percent of the abortion services we provide. Anyone who suspects I have violated the new law can sue me for at least $10,000. They could also sue anybody who helps a person obtain an abortion past the new limit, including, apparently, the driver who brings a patient to my clinic.
For me, it is 1972 all over again.
And that is why, on the morning of Sept. 6, I provided an abortion to a woman who, though still in her first trimester, was beyond the state’s new limit. I acted because I had a duty of care to this patient, as I do for all patients, and because she has a fundamental right to receive this care.
I fully understood that there could be legal consequences — but I wanted to make sure that Texas didn’t get away with its bid to prevent this blatantly unconstitutional law from being tested.


Braid concluded his piece: “I believe abortion is an essential part of health care.” Absolutely.

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *The kids played their rookie games against the Rangers this weekend and Saturday afternoon’s match was a lot of fun, with the Flyers coming out on top and a good time had by all... [Inquirer]
*... and then, in Sunday’s game, this: 
Wade Allison is hurt. Rangers defenseman Braden Schneider sent Allison into the boards and his right leg went under him funny. He needed assistance getting back to the locker room, wasn't putting any weight on his leg.
— Olivia Reiner (@ReinerOlivia) September 19, 2021



Maybe having potential roster players play in meaningless games before training camp is dumb?? Just one person’s thoughts (opinion). [NBC Sports Philly]
*Wade Allison was one of the stand-outs on Saturday, too. Kid is so fun. [NBC Sports Philly]
*In case you missed them, last week’s final entries into the 25 Under 25 were Emil Andrae at 15... [BSH]
*...and new guy Samu Tuomaala at 14. Today we head into the halfway point! Exciting!! [BSH]
*Brady Tkachuk still isn’t signed. That’s wild. No idea how he could do it, but if Chuck could do it, that would be a lot of fun for us. [Sportsnet]
*And finally, to wrap things up for this Monday morning, Montreal will be hosting the 2022 Entry Draft after being screwed out of the 2020 draft by the entire world shutting down due to a viral pandemic. Seems fair. [ProHockeyTalk]]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As announced at Apple's "California Streaming" media event on September 14, the public release of iOS 15 will be on Monday, September 20. iPadOS 15, watchOS 8, and tvOS 15 will be arriving on the same date, while a release date for macOS 12 Monterey has yet to be announced.





While we know iOS 15 is coming on September 20, Apple has not specified exactly what time of day it will be released. We can, however, make an educated guess as to the release timing.



The most frequent time of day for Apple software releases is right around 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time. In some parts of the world, this corresponds to times early in the morning of the following day, and Apple's regional websites for some of these countries do list the release date as September 21 rather than September 20.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple has started shipping out iPhone 13, ‌iPhone 13‌ mini, iPhone 13 Pro, and ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ Max orders to customers who pre-ordered one of the new devices on Friday, September 17.





Many orders will still say "Preparing to Ship" in Apple's ordering system and will continue to do so until later this week, but customers in the United States who are receiving their devices through UPS can use the UPS My Choice feature for tracking purposes or can track through a reference number like a phone number or an order number.





UPS My Choice is free to use and well worth checking out for those in the United States who want to keep an eye on their upcoming shipments. If you've ordered a new device and it's shipping via UPS, details should be available soon if they're not already available. At the current time, iPhones are shipping from China and will soon be arriving in the United States.





The new iPhone models are priced starting at $699 and the first pre-orders will begin arriving on Friday, September 24. Apple may also have some in store stock on Friday for walk-in purchases, so those who were not able to pre-order and get a Friday delivery date may still be able to get a device right on time.



All colors and capacities of the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ Max have sold out and orders placed now will not arrive until mid to late October. ‌iPhone 13‌ and 13 mini orders will arrive in early October, though some stores still have September pickup dates available.

It’s nostalgic, actually.
 Not everything is supposed to be new. Remakes of old classic songs, reunions of television shows that ended decades ago, rebooting old movie franchises for some damn reason — we like looking at the past and getting all mushy-hearted thinking about what time was like back then.
Well during the Philadelphia Flyers’ prospect showcase game against the New York Rangers on Saturday afternoon, we got a look back into what covering hockey on social media would have been like in 2004.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple's highly anticipated "California Streaming" event on Tuesday had an interesting mix of expected and unexpected news, including the iPhone 13 lineup that largely followed expectations and the Apple Watch Series 7 that didn't get the expected flat-sided redesign but otherwise matched up with rumors pretty well.





On the more unexpected front, we got updates to the iPad mini and entry-level iPad, something most people weren't expecting until a second autumn event in October or November. We also didn't get the third-generation AirPods, which were rumored but fairly uncertain about heading into the event.

 If you’re sitting down and getting into Deathloop, wait! Much like the protagonist of Deathloop himself, I’m jumping out of nowhere to give you an important warning to keep in mind as you start your journey. Don’t forget to kick! Kick doors, kick people, kick everything you can.
When I first started working my way through Blackreef, I forgot that I had a powerful kick at my disposal, because I was too busy keeping track of six other things. The Deathloop designers at Arkane Studios did an admirable job holding the player’s hand through the game’s info dumps with clever writing and concise summaries, but I still felt a little overwhelmed. 
Deathloop is a good game, but it’s definitely a dense one. The time loop thriller starts…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this engaging video we meet Aaron Fletcher, a traveling shepherd who has been “guerrilla grazing” and living off the land for 12 years.
He lets his sheep graze — with permission — public parks and side lots. Homeless by choice, he offers his services to small farms in exchange for food or a place to stay (though half his calories come from his sheeps’ milk).
With a tiny metal cart home pulled by his sheep, he has a bed, a refrigerator/evaporative cooler, a shower (he uses a pesticide sprayer to pump up the water pressure), power (solar panel), sun oven, a mailbox stove for heat, bicycle tire wheels and a corrugated plastic roof.
Fletcher makes cheese and butter from his sheep milk and forages for seeds, fruits, vegetables and herbs.


I heard about this from @hova414, who teases it better than I can:
An “anti-consumer” gives one of the most impressive product demos I’ve ever seen; a nonstop highlights reel of ingenious off-grid inventions. Come for the wearable teepee, stay for the solar banana bread.


My jaw legit dropped open at the solar bread part — that solar oven! It’s absolutely fascinating to listen to him explain how he efficiently uses space, public resources, and a limited amount of tightly curated technology products to live a happy and healthy life, an outcome many of us have been told by capitalism is impossible. I also enjoyed his distinction between being a selfish prepper and a community prepper:
By the way I’m a prepper, but I’m not like a normal prepper as in… I call it selfish prepping. I’m a community prepper. I’m not so interested in trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic situation if everyone around me is suffering. So I’m trying to figure out how to bring up the community so that they can all thrive.


You can learn more about Fletcher’s life and how he lives it on his website and check out his YouTube videos for more clever DIY tips.

THQ Nordic announces first full sequel since 1999
 Jagged Alliance, the 25-year-old turn-based tactics series, will finally deliver its second numbered sequel — and first of this century — with Jagged Alliance 3, coming to Windows PC at an unannounced date.
Jagged Alliance 3 will be developed by Haemimont Games and published by THQ Nordic, which acquired the Jagged Alliance IP in 2015. THQ Nordic on Friday also made the original Jagged Alliance: Gold Edition free on Steam, in observance of the publisher’s 10th anniversary. Jagged Alliance: Gold Edition comprises the 1995 game and its 1996 spinoff, Jagged Alliance: Deadly Games.
THQ Nordic said Jagged Alliance 3 will be “a true successor to the beloved series.” In it, players will command a mercenary force in the fictitious nation of Grand Chien, set against a brutal paramilitary adversary called The Legion.
“Jagged Alliance 3 will combine tactically deep, turn-based combat with exploration of a large game world with strategic elements,” THQ Nordic said, “including gaining control over territories, training local forces, and establishing multiple squads chosen from beloved mercenaries — all well known to fans of the series.”
The game will also include “RPG-elements like special perks or level-ups for your mercenaries, as well as looting and customizing your arsenal of weaponry,” the announcement said.
Haemimont Games, based in Sofia, Bulgaria, specializes in strategy and city-building games, but has never handled the Jagged Alliance series. Jagged Alliance 2 was published in 1999, following Deadly Games. 
Since then the series has gotten various expansions and content packs on different platforms, including 2012’s Jagged Alliance: Back In Action, a full remake of Jagged Alliance 2.]]></summary>

Appeal Games and THQ Nordic revive canceled sequel to Outcast
 If your response to the announcement of Outcast 2 - A New Beginning is, “I’m not sure I’ve ever heard of Outcast 1,” that’s quite understandable. The sequel was originally announced two decades ago.
The first Outcast game, an award-winning sci-fi adventure game developed by Appeal and published by Infogrames, was released on PC way back in 1999. The sequel, originally known as Outcast 2: The Lost Paradise, was announced the following year, but it was never completed due to financial issues.
But Outcast 2 looks like it’s actually going to happen this time, thanks to THQ Nordic, which is publishing the long-awaited sequel, once again developed by Appeal Studios. (The Belgian developer also released a modern remake of Outcast in 2017, titled Outcast - Second Contact, which Nacon published.) THQ Nordic says that its has reunited members of the original Outcast team, including composer Lennie Moore, to create Outcast 2.


Cutter Slade, the Navy SEAL protagonist of the original game, will return in Outcast 2 - A New Beginning. Cutter’s been resurrected “by the almighty Yods,” the game’s Steam page says, and will need to save the planet Adelpha from invading robot forces. Cutter’s jetpack will let him “jump, air-dash, glide, and quickly traverse” Outcast 2’s open world.
THQ Nordic and Appeal Studios describe Outcast 2 - A New Beginning as an open-world action-adventure game with non-linear story — players’ actions and decisions will change the narrative’s outcome. 
Outcast 2 is in development for PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X. THQ Nordic did not announce a release date.]]></summary>

THQ Nordic’s full remake of the 2006 game revealed
 THQ Nordic is reviving Destroy All Humans! 2 with a full remake of the 2006 game. Titled Destroy All Humans! 2 - Reprobed — this is the publisher who released Kingdoms of Amalur Re-Reckoning and Darksiders: Warmastered Edition, after all — the remake is being developed for PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X for a 2022 release.
Developer Black Forest Games promises local two-player split-screen co-op, and new and improved features, in its built-from-scratch remake of Destroy All Humans! 2. The Reprobed version, unlike its 2020 predecessor, does not appear to be bound for last-generation consoles.
The second game in the Destroy All Humans! franchise takes place in 1969, and sends protagonist Crypto on a revenge mission to new locations: Bay City, Albion, Takoshima, Tunguska, and Solaris, a Soviet base set up on Earth’s Moon.
The original Destroy All Humans! 2 was developed by Pandemic Studios, published by the former THQ, and released on PlayStation 2 and Xbox.]]></summary>

 In Timberborn, ‘beavers either work or die’
 Beavers are nature’s builders, and in Timberborn, released on PC in Steam Early Access on Wednesday, players manage a colony of these industrious critters in a post-human world. The city-building sim has a cuddly exterior, but don’t let that fool you — it’s legitimately challenging. As the game’s developer Mechanistry described it on its Twitch channel, in Timberborn “beavers either work or die.”
Timberborn takes place in a future version of our world where humankind has sapped planet Earth of her precious resources. Super-intelligent beavers have evolved and formed “lumberpunk” societies, where timber is a core resource that powers farming, river control, and society growth. Rather than city-building alone, Timberbo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During Tuesday's media event, Greg Joswiak noted that Apple has redesigned the packaging for the iPhone 13 lineup to eliminate the traditional outer plastic wrap on the box, a change that will avoid creating 600 metric tons of plastic waste.





As shared in a tweet by leaker DuanRui earlier today, it appears that Apple's solution is one already used on many Apple accessories, involving a sticker with a tear-off strip that secures the box until it's ready to be opened.

Apple is not the only company making changes to its packaging for sustainability reasons as part of  the ‌iPhone 13‌ launch, with Belkin today announcing that its new lineup of screen protectors for the ‌iPhone 13‌ family will arrive in packaging made entirely of recycled plastic water bottles and forest certified paper.





In addition to the packaging change, which is part of a broader internal and external sustainability initiative at the company, Belkin says the Screen Protector Applicator kits made available to retail stores to assist with installation will also transition to more sustainable materials including kraft paper, plant-based plastic liners, and soy-based ink.



Belkin's Anti-Glare Screen Protectors for all ‌iPhone 13‌ models are available from Apple for $19.95, while the UltraGlass Screen Protectors with double ion-exchange strengthened lithium aluminosilicate glass are priced at $39.95.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starting next month, Apple is ramping up COVID-19 testing requirements for employees. According to The Verge's Zoe Schiffer, unvaccinated employees will be required to get frequent COVID-19 tests, while vaccinated employees will receive infrequent tests if going into an office or store.





Unlike other tech companies, such as Google and Facebook, Apple has not mandated vaccines for its employees and still does not require workers to get vaccinated to remain at Apple. Prior to the upcoming testing mandate, testing was encouraged, but not required.



Apple earlier this month began asking employees to provide details on their vaccination status, and it has been pushing vaccines through an internal vaccination campaign.



Apple offers vouchers to get employees vaccinated through Walgreens along with on-site vaccinations in the San Francisco Bay Area and Austin. Paid time off is available for vaccine appointments, as is paid sick leave for those who experience side effects.



Many corporate employees are still working from home at this point and will not be returning to the office until January at the earliest, but Apple also has a large retail workforce.



The details on Apple's testing plans came from today's company-wide town hall meeting, where Cook also spoke on plans for a hybrid work model going forward. "We learned as a company what it means for everyone to come in everyday because we did that before," he said. "We know what it's like when hardly anyone comes in. We don't really know about the middle range. We need to learn."



Cook said that Apple is committed to learning and tweaking its plans going forward, and he said that Apple plans to give everyone an extra three days off next quarter. In the U.S., employees will receive this time off on Thanksgiving week.

The new iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max unveiled this week feature ProMotion displays with a variable refresh rate between 10Hz and 120Hz, resulting in smoother appearing content when watching video, gaming, or scrolling text. The devices are able to offer this feature because they are equipped with lower-power LTPO OLED displays, whereas the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini have LTPS OLED displays without support for ProMotion.



The lack of ProMotion on at least one iPhone 14 model wouldn't be too surprising, as Apple may keep the feature limited to the Pro models next year to maintain differentiation with the standard iPhone 14 models. Rumors suggest Apple plans to launch four iPhone 14 models next year, including a 6.1-inch iPhone 14, 6.7-inch iPhone 14 Max, 6.1-inch iPhone 14 Pro, and 6.7-inch iPhone 14 Pro Max, with no iPhone 14 mini.



The report adds that LG Display is aiming to start supplying Apple with LTPO OLED displays in 2022, which would give Apple another supplier of ProMotion displays for iPhones beyond Samsung, which is currently its exclusive supplier.



In the past, The Elec accurately reported that Apple would launch a new iPad Pro with a LiDAR Scanner in March 2020.

 Alex Chen has a unique power — she’s an empath in the most literal sense of the word. Life is Strange: True Colors follows Alex as she leaves the foster-care system and moves to Haven Springs to live with her estranged brother, whom she’s been separated from because of that system.
The game itself begins on Alex’s first day in Haven Springs, reuniting with Gabe after eight years and setting up shop in a space that she just might be able to call home. She’s trying to live a normal life — one balanced by freedom and connection — unhindered by her empathic abilities that allow her to feel (and sometimes overcome by) other people’s strong emotions.

 Halo: The Master Chief Collection’s eighth season of updates will be the last one for the anthology, 343 Industries told fans on Wednesday. The studio said it is focusing on giving the 2014 collection a successful send-off so that developers may focus on the launch of Halo Infinite, coming in early December.
The final season does not mean no more updates or support, 343 said. “We have more MCC work to do and support will continue,” Tyler Davis, 343’s community manager, wrote on Wednesday. However, “as a studio it’s not ideal to run and continue shipping seasonal updates for two different multiplayer titles concurrently,” alluding to Halo Infinite, whose multipl…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coinciding with the start of iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro pre-orders, Apple today started offering 0% financing for an extended 24 months on new iPhone purchases in Canada through financing partner PayBright, up from six months previously.





For example, customers with approved credit can now pay for the iPhone 13 Pro with 128GB of storage for 24 equal monthly payments of $58.29, with zero interest applied over those two years. Taxes must be paid in full upfront at the time of purchase. The financing option is available through Apple's website, retail stores, or by calling 1-800-MY-APPLE.



With the lack of an iPhone Upgrade Program or the Apple Card with Monthly Installments in Canada, this financing offer from PayBright finally provides Canadians with a way to finance an iPhone purchase directly from Apple over two years.



Update: PayBright has been experiencing issues today with the iPhone 13 pre-order process, according to complaints on Twitter.




@PayBrightCanada, the company responsible for financing, has been down since preorders started. It had been impossible to complete a purchase.
— Noah Segal (@noahsegal3) September 17, 2021
 



Unfortunately it doesn’t get through. Paybright is down.
— Fayaz😷 (@faythebest) September 17, 2021
 



The more interesting story will be the catastrophic failure of @Apple’s lending partner @PayBrightCanada

The 2020 second-round pick has definite offensive upside, there’s no denying that.

How did Andrae’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
After getting a taste of the Sweden’s highest tier league towards the end of his 2019-20 season at just 17 years of age, Andrae logged more valuable time in the SHL before being loaned to Vasterviks in the second-tier league for 15 games in which he notched three goals and three assists.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today opened pre-orders for all four iPhone 13 models through its website and the Apple Store app, and estimated delivery times are already slipping into October for Pro models with the all-new 1TB storage option in the U.S. and select other countries.





iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max are available with up to 1TB of storage, which is the largest storage capacity ever offered in an iPhone. The storage option is not cheap, with prices reaching up to $1,599 for the iPhone 13 Pro Max with 1TB in the United States. 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB storage options are also available, with many configurations still available for September 24 launch day delivery as of writing.



The standard iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini models are likewise available with 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB of storage, but there is no 1TB option for those devices.



Key features across the iPhone 13 lineup include a faster A15 Bionic chip, camera improvements, longer battery life, and a smaller notch. The two Pro models also feature a ProMotion display with a variable refresh rate up to 120Hz. All four iPhone 13 models will begin arriving to customers and launch in stores on Friday, September 24.



Update: In the time since this story was published, certain other iPhone 13 models, storage capacities, and color combinations have started facing extended delivery estimates into October. Discuss your pre-order in the MacRumors forums.

 *It is rookie game weekend, with the kids getting set to take on the Rangers a couple of times. If you didn’t know the origin of these kinds of games, it’s pretty neat. [The Athletic]
*Anyhoo, day one of rookie camp was yesterday and there are a few early standouts. [Inquirer]
*So yesterday we got a look at the national broadcast schedule; the Flyers are getting 13 of them. [NBC Sports Philly]
*In case you missed them here are the latest 25 Under 25 ranked youths; at 18, the Bunn Man... [BSH]

        <link href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/17/iphone-13-battery-excels-video-streaming/"/>
        <updated>2021-09-17T09:34:49.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple has made much of its iPhone 13 battery life improvements, noting for example that the 13 Pro Max offers the longest battery life ever in an iPhone. However, when you look at Apple's own battery comparisons versus the iPhone 12 lineup, it's the streaming video performance that the company has eked out of its new smartphones that really stands out. 





iPhone 12 mini: 10 hours


iPhone 12: 11 hours


iPhone 12 Pro: 11 hours


iPhone 12 Pro Max: 12 hours






iPhone 13 Mini: 13 hours


iPhone 13: 19 hours


iPhone 13 Pro: 20 hours


iPhone 13 Pro Max: 25 hours
 

The iPhone 13 lineup features new low-power displays, a more efficient A15 chip, larger batteries, and more power-efficient components, all of which make for dramatic improvements when streaming, as the numbers above show. 



For example, Apple claims that when streaming video, the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max last nine hours and 13 hours longer than last year's equivalent models, respectively. Taking the same metric, the battery in the iPhone 13 mini manages 13 hours, which is longer than even the iPhone 12 Pro Max. 



With video streaming services so ubiquitous these days, not to mention Apple TV+ (and obliquely, Fitness+), Apple has clearly factored the computations involved into the power optimizations that it has achieved through the tight integration of its hardware and software. 



Of course, battery life varies by use case and many other factors, so actual results will vary, but if they're anything near what Apple is claiming, binge-watching your favorite show should be a cinch on these latest devices.



(H/T to Jack for pointing this out!)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple's online store is down ahead of iPhone 13 mini, ‌iPhone 13‌, iPhone 13 Pro, and ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ Max pre-orders, which are set to begin at 5:00 a.m. Pacific Time in the United States.





"You're... early," reads the Apple Store message when attempting to visit the U.S. website. "Pre-order begins at 5:00 a.m. PDT. Enjoy the extra sleep." Apple used to do new device pre-orders at 12:01 a.m. Pacific Time, but since 2019, has been holding iPhone pre-orders at 5:00 a.m.



The ‌‌iPhone 13‌ mini, ‌iPhone 13‌,‌ ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌, and ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ Max are launching in more than 30 countries and regions around the world, and a full list of launch times can be found in our time zone guide.



All of the new ‌iPhone 13‌ models are nearly identical in design to last year's iPhone 12 models, featuring flat edges, an aerospace-grade aluminum enclosure, a glass back, and a slight increase in thickness. 



Key features across the ‌iPhone 13‌ lineup include a faster A15 Bionic chip, camera improvements, longer battery life, and a smaller notch. The two Pro models also feature a ProMotion display with a variable refresh rate up to 120Hz. The ‌iPhone 13‌ models are available in Pink, Blue, Midnight (black), Starlight (silver/gold), and (PRODUCT)RED.



If you're hoping to get one of the models in the ‌new ‌iPhone 13‌ lineup on launch day, it's a good idea to purchase early because there's no word on how much supply Apple will have. 



Pricing on the ‌iPhone 13‌ mini starts at $699, while pricing on the ‌iPhone 13‌ starts at $799, the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ starts at $999, and the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ Max begins at $1099. The official launch, when pre-orders will be out for delivery, is next Friday, September 24.

Plus a weapons rework and an Obliterator!
 Valheim, the Viking sandbox game, had an explosively popular launch. Now developer Iron Gate Studio is ready to release the game’s first content update, Hearth & Home. As you might guess from the title, the update largely centers around building nicer bases. But there are other upgrades to combat, crafting, and exploration that are tucked into Hearth & Home, which makes it a nice time to return to Valheim for eager Vikings.
There’s new furniture and food for players to divide, like the Darkwood building pieces, and a new stone throne and hot tub. There are also crystal walls and shelves to showcase all of your treasure, which is a nice touch. Then there are more cooking supplies, a cartography table, an Obliterator to destroy unwanted items, and a new iron cooking station for gourmet recipes. 
There are also general improvements to the game, like a weapon rebalance that makes each individual weapon feel a little more distinct. There are also 12 new food items and a host of new weapons. 
Hearth & Home is a free update and plays best on a fresh Valheim world. Valheim is available on Steam and is still in Early Access, which is promising considering the game had a very strong and satisfying launch and has already sold seven million copies.]]></summary>

This video is like a private cooking class with a very thoughtful & knowledgable host — and it made me incredibly hungry. A good pairing might be Saxelby’s recent book, The New Rules of Cheese.
But….. at the first mention of the word “fridge”, I could not help but think of this classic interview with French marketing consultant Clotaire Rapaille: In America, the Cheese Is Dead.
For example, if I know that in America the cheese is dead, which means is pasteurized, which means legally dead and scientifically dead, and we don’t want any cheese that is alive, then I have to put that up front. I have to say this cheese is safe, is pasteurized, is wrapped up in plastic. I know that plastic is a body bag. You can put it in the fridge. I know the fridge is the morgue; that’s where you put the dead bodies. And so once you know that, this is the way you market cheese in America.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Customers who order one of Apple's lower-cost Apple Watch SE devices will now receive an upgraded USB-C charging cable in the package, rather than the previous USB-A charging cable.





Apple is changing the cable in the box as it continues to transition away from USB-A and for consistency across the Apple Watch lineup.



The ‌Apple Watch SE‌ will apparently ship with the same USB-C Fast Charger that's available with the Apple Watch Series 7, but fast charging is limited to the new models. Though the cable is the same, the ‌Apple Watch SE‌ will charge at standard speeds.



With the fast charge cable, the Series 7 is able to charge 33 percent faster than with a standard Apple Watch charging puck thanks to new charging architecture that is not built into the ‌Apple Watch SE‌.



The ‌Apple Watch SE‌'s product page confirms the upgrade and lists the device as shipping with a "1m Magnetic Charger to USB-C Cable" rather than the standard Magnetic Cable that used USB-A. Apple previously had a non-fast charging version of the USB-C Apple Watch cable, but it has been discontinued and is no longer available.



While the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ and ‌Apple Watch SE‌ will ship with a USB-C Apple Watch charging cable, the Apple Watch Series 3, Apple's lowest cost option, still continues to feature a USB-A charging cable.

Season 4 starts on Sept. 23
 A new Sea of Thieves season is about to begin, which means pirates will be granted new in-game challenges and a Plunder Pass full of rewards. Season 4 is due to start on Sept. 23, and Rare has posted a very short teaser showcasing what the new season will have to offer. It looks as though pirates are going to have to delve beneath the waves, which is a notoriously dangerous place.
Season 3 was based around the Pirates of the Caribbean crossover with Captain Jack Sparrow. A Pirate’s Life was meant to be cinematic and story based, but it looks like season 4 will return to the Sea of Thieves-specific lore and expand on the existing world. We haven’t spent that much time under the sea, but there are tons of threats down there to defeat — and treasure to obtain.

Sea of Thieves seasons come with a Plunder Pass, which includes a free and paid version. The paid version usually includes neat cosmetics, like a new coat of paint for your ship or a nice ruffled shirt to wear at an outpost. These passes also include in-game currencies like doubloons and gold.
Sea of Thieves’ season 4 is set to release on Sept. 23, and will run for about three months.]]></summary>

Ranking in Spring 2020 25 Under 25: N/A
How did Desnoyers’ 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
Desnoyers had a terrific 2020-21. He massively improved his point-per-game ratio, scoring 1.32 points per game. He actually led his team in scoring, besting 2021 first round draft pick Zachary L’Heureux (Nashville). This is a massive increase in his offensive production from his last season prior where he only scored 0.57 points per game. At the time he was drafted, he was known as a primarily supporting player, a grinder who is defe…]]></summary>

His long-time producer Lydia Tenaglia saw this too…she cold-called him after reading the book and pitched him on doing a TV show called A Cook’s Tour, where the intrepid Bourdain would travel to different locations around the world to experience the food culture there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Both the iPhone 13 and the new iPad mini are equipped with Apple's latest A15 Bionic chip, but benchmark results reveal that the chip is downclocked to 2.9GHz in the iPad mini, compared to 3.2GHz in all iPhone 13 models. 





As to be expected, the downclocked chip appears to have a small 2-8% impact on the iPad mini's performance compared to iPhone 13 models. In early Geekbench 5 results, the new iPad mini has average single-core and multi-core scores of around 1,595 and 4,540, compared to averages of around 1,730 and 4,660 for the iPhone 13 Pro.



MacRumors ran the benchmarks by Geekbench founder John Poole, who said the results appear to be legitimate, including the 2.9GHz clock speed.



It's unclear why Apple has downclocked the A15 chip in the iPad mini, but most users are unlikely to encounter any issues with performance using the device. Even with a downclocked A15 chip, the new iPad mini is up to 40% faster in single-core performance and up to 70% faster in multi-core performance compared to the previous-generation iPad mini with an A12 chip, according to benchmarks. We've reached out to Apple for comment.



The new iPad mini is available to order now and launches Friday, September 24. iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro pre-orders begin tomorrow at 5 a.m. Pacific Time, and we've also shared iPhone 13 benchmarks for those interested.

 When MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries launched in 2019, it was a deeply flawed game — and to a large extent, it still is. But the developers at Piranha Games have been relentless in applying new updates to improve the situation. The next attempt, announced Thursday, is a free update coming on Sept. 23 that could allow players to bypass one of the game’s biggest flaws.
MechWarrior 5 focuses on the lance, a formation of four heavily armed righting robots called Mechs. In multiplayer, you can get other humans to be your three lancemates, but in single player the rest of your team is controlled by the AI. At launch, that AI was dangerously stupid.

It was a little bit of a weird season for Cates. He certainly didn’t have a poor season, to be clear, but it wasn't stellar. We know him as something of a details player, who does all of the little things right, and that’s a piece of his game that was working well throughout the season, that didn’t go away.

Everybody’s favorite rabbit-man didn’t have a particularly hare-raising season.
 No. 18: Connor Bunnaman
2020-21 League/Team(s): Lehigh Valley Phantoms (AHL), Philadelphia Flyers (NHL)
2020-21 Statistics: 1 G, 1 A, 2 P in 15 GP (AHL), 1 A, 1 P in 18 GP (NHL)

Ranking in Spring 2020 25 Under 25: 23
How did Bunnaman’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
Bunnaman didn’t do anything to impress in 2020-21, particularly upon his return to the AHL. While his brief, unproductive stint in the big leagues is completely understandable given his unstable status within the lineup, inexperience, and the general difficulty of adapting to the difference in spe…]]></summary>

Toby Fox announced the chapter as part of an Undertale stream
 Deltarune Chapter 2, the next installment of the sequel to beloved indie darling Undertale, will be released Friday evening. The game will be coming first to Windows PC and Mac OS, according to its announcement trailer. Creator Toby Fox announced the game as part of a livestream celebrating the sixth anniversary of Undertale. 
No word on when the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 versions will be released, but if you played on a console and want to play on a computer this weekend, you’ll still be able to. Players with no save data will be able to start right at Chapter 2 once it’s released at 8 p.m. EDT on Sept. 17. “As long as you generally remember what happened story-wise, you’ll be fine,” the developers said in an FAQ. 
DELTARUNE Chapter 2 will release at 8PM ET on 9/17. 
Thanks for waiting.https://t.co/dY8doW04bT pic.twitter.com/SJssTEF5gV

Deltarune takes place in the larger world of Undertale, and is intended for fans familiar with the first story. In it, you play as Kris, a child who one day accidentally fell into an alternate “Dark World” with their friend, Susie. Once there, the two are informed that they’re part of a team of three heroes destined to save it from eternal darkness. Deltarune isn’t a complete game; the only existing chapter of its story came out in 2018, and the second chapter will pick up after the events of the first.  
If you played Deltarune on PC or Mac, you will be able to carry your save file over. Just make sure you have rolled credits on it, and the completion data will generate in your game.
As for how much of the story this chapter will include, we won’t know The website confirms that there will be additional chapters to come, and that the team has only “completed Chapter 2 so far, so please be patient.”]]></summary>

In the weeks and months leading up to the event, credible reports from reliable journalists and leakers suggested the new Apple Watch would be sporting a flat-edged design.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When it was built in the 1920s in Turin, Italy, the Fiat factory was designed with a racetrack on the top of the building, both for car testing purposes and for racing.
The factory’s best-known symbol is the test track, which is a superb piece of design modeling, and construction that occupies the whole roof surface of the workshops. Two 443 meters straights, joined by parabolic bends, form a continuous track for testing the cars.
Originally, as soon as the cars left the assembly lines they could flow directly upward to the test track through the snail-shaped ramps completing the whole processing cycle inside the factory. Moreover, these spiraling ramps inside the building allowed the cars to be driven back down and into showrooms.


The track was a little over 1/2 mile long. Many more views at Rare Historical Photos. (via @laxgani)

and I mentioned that I really like debugging using a REPL. He said he’d never
tried it and that it sounded fun, so I thought I’d write a quick post about it.
This debugging method doesn’t work in a lot of languages, but it does work in
Python and Ruby and kiiiiiind of in C (via gdb).
what’s a REPL?
REPL stands for “read eval print loop”. A REPL is a program that:
reads some input from you like print(f"2 + 2 = {2+2}") (read)
evaluates the input (eval)
print out the result (print)
and then goes back to step 1 (loop)
Here’s an example of me using the IPython REPL to run a print statement. (also
it demonstrates f-strings, my favourite Python 3 feature)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following updates to its product lineups this week, Apple has quietly discontinued the 256GB capacity option for the iPhone SE. 





Prior to this week, the ‌iPhone SE‌ was available in 64GB, 128GB, and 256GB configurations, but since Tuesday's "California streaming" event and subsequent product lineup rejig, only the first and second of those capacities are listed on Apple's online store. Pricing for the 64GB and 128GB ‌iPhone SE‌ options remains the same.



According to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple is planning an update to the ‌iPhone SE‌ for the first half of 2022. The current model was launched in April 2020, so the removal of the 256GB variant could be a sign that Apple is beginning to ramp down production of this particular model.



During its virtual event, Apple announced that the iPhone 13 and ‌iPhone 13‌ mini start with 128GB of storage, which is double the base 64GB offered for the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini.



The storage capacities available for the ‌iPhone 13‌ and ‌iPhone 13‌ mini include 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB, while the iPhone 13 Pro and ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ Max also have a new 1TB storage option. 



Pricing continues to start at $699 for the ‌iPhone 13‌ mini, $799 for the ‌iPhone 13‌, $999 for the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌, and $1,099 for the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ Max. Preorders for the new ‌iPhone 13‌ models begin Friday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier today, we reported on a Geekbench Metal result for the iPhone 13 Pro showing an approximately 55% graphics performance improvement compared to the iPhone 12 Pro.





Since that time, additional Geekbench results for both CPU and GPU performance across the iPhone 13 lineup have surfaced to provide a more complete look at the improvements.



On the graphics side, a Metal result for the iPhone 13 (designated iPhone14,5) reveals a score of 10608 for the A15 Bionic in that device, roughly 15% higher than the score for the A14 Bionic in the iPhone 12.





The Metal score for the ‌iPhone 13‌ is significantly lower than the corresponding 14216 score for the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ due to the fact that the Pro models (and the new A15-equipped iPad mini) feature a 5-core GPU while the regular ‌iPhone 13‌ models include a 4-core GPU.



Turning to CPU performance, we see similar scores across regular and Pro devices in the ‌iPhone 13‌ lineup because they all feature the same 6-core CPU setup. A survey of scores coming in today reveals single-core scores of around 1725 and multi-core scores generally around 4600.





These scores represent a roughly 10% increase in single-core performance and 18% increase in multi-core performance compared to the A14 Bionic in the iPhone 12 lineup.



With only a handful of results registered in the Geekbench database so far, these scores are still rough estimates, but the average scores will firm up over time as more come in.

Samsung Display said it has been supplying the OLED panels to global manufacturers, including ASUS, Lenovo, Dell, HP, and Samsung Electronics, for use in laptops, including ASUS's recently announced Zenbook and Vivobook Pro laptops. Apple was not mentioned as being a customer, but Korean website The Elec last month reported that Samsung Display was preparing its production lines for future MacBooks with OLED displays, and DigiTimes has said Apple plans to launch a 16-inch MacBook Pro with an OLED display in 2022.

We're overdue for a 16-inch MacBook Pro refresh, and rumors suggest that it's coming soon. Multiple rumors have pointed towards 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with slimmer bezels and a flat-edged design that's not too much of a departure from the current design.

The UK is Hell’s 10th circle, according to Thatcher’s Techbase
 If you’re a Doom fan feeling nostalgic for the 1980s as represented by big hair, bad fashion, and British accents, look no further than Thatcher’s Techbase, a forthcoming Doom WAD that pits you against the Iron Lady and her hellspawn.
Available Sept. 24 on “PC, Mac, Linux and whatever the hell you want to try running it on,” Thatcher’s Techbase is brought to you by modder Dr. Doom Daddy and an all-star cast of collaborators. The mod supports cooperative and deathmatch play, offers five difficulty levels, and is “completely free.”
On September 24th, Margaret Thatcher will rise from her grave. Only you can send her back to Hell.

— Dr. Doom Daddy (@letshugbro) September 15, 2021



The mod’s official description doesn’t make it sound like this is a tribute to Maggie Thatcher, prime minister from 1979 to 1990. “Faced with the return of one of humanity’s greatest threats, you have no choice but to head to the 10th circle of hell,” it reads. “The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.” OK then!
Thatcher is regarded by historians as one of the 20th century’s more accomplished PMs, though she consistently faced low approval ratings in her public life. One would expect that of a politician who took free milk away from schoolchildren. Tut-tut.
Barry Topping (Paradise Killer) supplies the soundtrack, which will be dropping on Bandcamp next week. The cast of voice actors includes Laila Berzins, who was Persephone and Demeter in Hades (and is also The Baroness, the big bad of Lost In Random, which launched Friday). Rafael Batista de Lima illustrated the sprites, while Core Lo Art designed the key art, which shows Thatcher-as-Cyberdemon blasting away at Doomguy.]]></summary>

 Battlefield 2042 won’t make its intended release date. Developer DICE announced Wednesday that the game has been delayed until Nov. 19, nearly a month after its originally planned release date of Oct. 22.
In a statement released on Twitter, DICE general manager Oskar Gabrielson explained that the delay was largely due to the challenges of working from home during the pandemic.
“Building the next generation of Battlefield during a global pandemic has created unforeseen challenges for our development teams,” Gabrielson said in a statement also attributed to the Battlefield 2042 development team. “Given the scale and scope of the game, we had hoped our team would be back in our studios together as we m…]]></summary>

“We started working on an algorithm about three years ago,” explained Rivera, FIFA 22’s lead gameplay producer at EA Vancouver. “What that algorithm is doing is learning from all the data for that motion capture shoot — how the players approach the ball, how many steps do they do to get to the ball, is it three long steps and one short step; what is the proper angle, with the proper cadence, to properly hi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple CEO Tim Cook is one of the 100 Most Influential People of 2021 according to TIME's newly published rankings. TIME shares an annual list highlighting world leaders, celebrities, tech company executives, authors, musicians, athletes, and more, and this is not the first time Cook has been celebrated.





This year's list is broken up into categories that include Icons, Pioneers, Titans, Artists, Leaders, and Innovators. Cook is listed in the "Titans" category alongside Shonda Rhimes, Tom Brady, Timbaland and Swizz Beats, Simone Biles, and others.



Cook's profile was written by Nike co-founder Phil Knight, who reflected on his relationship with Cook and his talks with Cook as a Nike board member. According to Knight, Cook is a man of "wisdom" and "excellent judgment."
One of his most difficult challenges was the change of leadership at Apple after Steve Jobs passed away, the Steve Jobs who was beloved and recognized around the world as a genius.



This almost impossible transition was handled with amazing dignity and grace, and announced to the world in his own quiet way: "I am not the second Steve Jobs. I am the first Tim Cook."



And by the way, in the 10 years since... Apple stock has gone up 1,000%, making it the most valuable company in the world.
Other notable names who made this year's list include Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, Naomi Osaka, Billie Eilish, "Ted Lasso" star Jason Sudeikis, Joe Biden, and Elon Musk.



Earlier this year, Apple was listed as one of TIME's 100 Most Influential Companies of 2021 thanks to its record breaking holiday quarter and ever increasing product lineup.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple this week continued distributing new firmware for the AirTags that first rolled out in August. There have been several minor releases with different build numbers, and behind the scenes, those tweaks were to meter the number of people who were seeing the AirTag update at one time.





The last version, for example, with a build number of 1A291e changed nothing other than the rate limit on the percentage of ‌AirTags‌ users getting the update. That update set the limit to 25 percent, and another build released yesterday (1A291f) removes the deployment limit entirely, so all users should now be able to get the firmware update.



A portion of people will have already received the new firmware, but anyone who had not should see their ‌AirTags‌ updating over the next few days. There's still no word on what's included in the ‌AirTags‌ firmware, and no new features have been found so it likely focuses on bug fixes and other under-the-hood improvements.



It is not clear why Apple has metered the release of the ‌AirTags‌ firmware update, but it may have to do with the over-the-air distribution method.



Apple does not provide an option to force an AirTag update, as it's something that's done over-the-air through a connected iPhone. To make sure the update happens, you can put your AirTag in range of your ‌‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌‌, but you have to wait for the firmware to roll out to your device.



You can check your current AirTag firmware version using the Find My app, with instructions available in our how to.

Break the Loop
 Deathloop is a lot of things — shooter, looter, murder puzzle, time loop mystery, and more. Even after the tutorial level that cleverly introduces Blackreef’s weird rules, it still takes a while to wrap your mind around the time loop. And your success depends on understanding and manipulating those rules.
Polygon’s Deathloop walkthrough and guides are here to help you on every step of your journey to break the loop. We’ve got a beginner’s guide with 10 tips on getting started, along with lists and explainers for weapons, Slabs (Deathloop’s magic powers), and Trinkets.
Our walkthroughs will give you all the information you need to kill your assassination targets, the Visionaries, and claim their Slabs. These missions are called Visionary Leads. They’re in our preferred order in the table of contents up above, or you can use these links (which are also in our order): Ubiquity (Wenjie), Chaos Theory (Harriet) and the Nexus Slab, Space Invader (Charlie) and the Shift Slab, Afternoon Delight (Fia) and the Havoc Slab, What Wenjies Want (Wenjie again), Lost in Transmission (Egor) and the Aether Slab, The Ballad of Ramblin’ Frank (Frank), Devouring of the Lambs (Aleksis) and the Karnesis Slab, and Radio Silence (Julianna). We also have a spoiler-filled walkthrough for the game’s final Lead and ending.
We’ve also got guides to some of Deathloop’s harder to find treasures like how to find a Cat Fall Trinket or how to collect a purple-tier Pepper Mill early in the game.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Killian Bell, writing at Cult of Mac:
Apple Watch Series 7 is not the upgrade most of us expected to see
from Tuesday’s Apple event. The new model doesn’t sport the big
design refresh multiple sources said was coming. It doesn’t even
pack a new chip.
Is this the upgrade Apple wanted to deliver this year? Or is it
a last-minute substitution that Cupertino had to settle on
because the refresh it really wanted to deliver just wasn’t
ready to roll out?
Based on the evidence, we’re going to say it’s the latter.
The only way this could be funnier is if Bell included the theory that perhaps Apple changed the hardware at the last minute because the flat-edge designs leaked.
This is not how hardware works. These designs are set long in advance. In fact, from what I’ve heard, the flat-edge watch designs might be legitimate leaks, but they’re next year’s designs. That’s how far in advance Apple works on hardware — they were already in the advanced stages of designing the 2022 Apple Watches months ago. (Aesthetically, I am not sold on a flat-edge design for the watch. The round edges are iconic and organic.)
You can argue that Series 7 is a marginal upgrade over Series 6, but with an all-new screen (brighter and bigger), all-new crystal (more durable), and 33 percent faster charging, there are upgrades, and none of them could be slapped together.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple this week introduced a redesigned sixth-generation iPad mini that looks much closer to the current iPad Air, with slimmer bezels, a Touch ID power button, a USB-C port, compatibility with the second-generation Apple Pencil, and more.





The new iPad mini is equipped with the same A15 Bionic chip as iPhone 13 models, and while Apple doesn’t advertise the amount of RAM in the device, MacRumors can confirm that the new iPad mini has 4GB of RAM, an increase from 3GB of in the previous iPad mini. We can also confirm the ninth-generation iPad has the same 3GB of RAM as the eighth-generation model. These amounts were revealed in strings contained within the Xcode 13 beta.



For comparison, the iPad Pro is available with up to 16GB of RAM depending on storage capacity, while the latest iPad Air has 4GB of RAM.



The same type of Xcode strings accurately revealed the amount of RAM in iPhone 12 models last year and in several previous iPhone generations. Teardowns and regulatory filings should provide further confirmation in the coming days.



The new iPad mini and iPad models are available to order now on Apple's website and launch on Friday, September 24.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Citizen Lab:
In March 2021, we examined the phone of a Saudi activist who has
chosen to remain anonymous, and determined that they had been
hacked with NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware. During the course of the
analysis we obtained an iTunes backup of the device.
Recent re-analysis of the backup yielded several files with the
“.gif” extension in Library/SMS/Attachments that we determined
were sent to the phone immediately before it was hacked with NSO
Group’s Pegasus spyware.
Because the format of the files matched two types of crashes we
had observed on another phone when it was hacked with Pegasus, we
suspected that the “.gif” files might contain parts of what we are
calling the FORCEDENTRY exploit chain.
Citizen Lab forwarded the artifacts to Apple on Tuesday, September
7. On Monday, September 13, Apple confirmed that the files
included a zero-day exploit against iOS and MacOS. They designated
the FORCEDENTRY exploit CVE-2021-30860, and describe it as
“processing a maliciously crafted PDF may lead to arbitrary code
execution.”
The files with the “.gif” extension weren’t actually GIF files — they were carefully-crafted malformed PSD and PDF files that triggered image processing bugs. What makes attacks like this particularly dastardly is that the victim apparently doesn’t even see anything. It’s invisible.

This Thursday will be a big day for our community: we’re moving our comments to a brand new platform, developed especially for SB Nation. All of our hockey communities will be moving to the new platform, and I’m excited about the change.
Some of you may already be familiar with this new platform as it rolled out to our NFL communities last year and to many of our soccer sites over the summer. Over 30 new versions of the platform have been released since then, each bringing new features for SB Nation communities specifically, and changes to the user experience based on community member feedback.

How did Attard’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
Attard had little short of a stellar sophomore season with Western Michigan. He finished the season second in total points (behind forward Drew Worrad), and tied for second in goals scored (behind Ethen Frank and tied with Paul Washe, both forwards). It was a great campaign, for which he was named the NCHC’s best offensive defenseman at the close of the season.

These amounts are unchanged from the iPhone 12 lineup.





The same Xcode strings accurately revealed the amount of RAM in iPhone 12 models last year and in several previous iPhone generations.



iPhone 13 models feature a more power efficient A15 Bionic chip based on TSMC's advanced 5nm+ process, but Apple has not indicated how much faster the chip is compared to the A14 chip. The A15 chip also has a new 5-core GPU in iPhone 13 Pro models — up from 4 cores — that Apple says delivers the "fastest graphics performance in any smartphone." 



All four iPhone 13 models will be available to pre-order starting Friday, September 17 at 5 a.m. Pacific Time in the U.S. and over 30 other countries and regions. The devices are set to launch one week later on Friday, September 24.

The former second-round pick and Guelph Storm standout slips a touch in the rankings, but has big upside.
 No. 20: Isaac Ratcliffe
2020-21 League/Team(s): Lehigh Valley Phantoms, AHL
2020-21 Statistics: 2 G, 6 A, 8 P in 22 G
Age: 22
Acquired In: 2017 NHL Entry Draft, 35th overall
Ranking in Spring 2020 25 Under 25: 15
How did Ratcliffe ’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
The 6-foot-6 forward did see an uptick in terms of point production (from .28 PPG in 2019-20 to .36 in 2020-21), so it’s hard to really say his stock went down more as the Flyers added some high-end prospects since the last run of rankings. 
Ratcliffe always fit the bill of a project power forward…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While third-generation AirPods were not announced at the Apple Event this week, suppliers have already kicked off shipments of the long-awaited headphones, according to industry sources cited by Taiwanese website DigiTimes. 





In a paywalled preview of its report, DigiTimes said the shipments have been "slow," but production being underway is a good sign that the third-generation AirPods will likely be released before the end of the year. There will likely be another Mac-focused Apple Event this year, and the new AirPods could be unveiled then, or they could be announced with a press release through the Apple Newsroom at any point this fall.



The third-generation ‌AirPods‌ are expected to feature a design language similar to the ‌AirPods Pro‌, but without active noise cancellation. However, rumors have conflicted as to whether the new design will include silicone ear tips.



The second-generation AirPods were released in March 2019, priced at $159 with a wired charging case or $199 with a wireless charging case.

It took him a little while to get settled, but once he did, he was pretty solid for them. He wasn’t perfect, h…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the announcement of the iPhone 13, Apple Watch Series 7, and the new sixth-generation iPad mini, Apple gave YouTuber iJustine a chance to talk to Apple CEO Tim Cook about the new announcements, including some tidbits about Fitness+.







In the nearly 15 minutes' long interview, Cook describes the new camera features of the ‌iPhone 13‌, specifically Cinematic Mode, as a "mindblowing" addition to the iPhone that places it on par with professional high-end video equipment. The interview doesn't heavily touch on the new ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌, but Cook notes how the device has become an integral part of his workout routine thanks to its integration with Fitness+.



The ‌iPhone 13‌ and iPhone 13 Pro are incremental upgrades compared to the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro, featuring a smaller notch, improved performance thanks to the A15 Bionic, new camera features, and more. Catch up on everything Apple announced yesterday using our event recap.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday during Apple's virtual "California streaming" event, Apple debuted a refreshed ninth-generation entry-level iPad ($329) and a redesigned sixth-generation iPad mini ($499). Like the iPad Pro, both devices include a 12-megapixel Ultra Wide front camera enabling Center Stage, which makes the iPad Air ($579) the only tablet in Apple's lineup that lacks this feature.





Center Stage is a feature that automatically keeps users perfectly framed during video calls, and it does this by using the much larger field of view of the Ultra Wide front camera. 



As users move around, Center Stage automatically pans to keep them in the shot. When other people join in on the call, the camera detects them too, and smoothly zooms out to fit everyone into the view and make sure they are part of the conversation. 



Apple debuted the feature in April with the latest ‌iPad Pro‌. At the time, it was thought the machine learning capabilities of Apple's M1 chip were required to power the feature, but given that the new iPad and iPad mini use A13 and A15 Bionic chips, respectively, that's patently not the case.



The current ‌iPad Air‌, which debuted in September 2020, has an A14 Bionic processor, but only a f/2.0, 7-megapixel front-facing FaceTime HD Camera for selfies and video calls, making it incompatible with Center Stage. The ‌iPad Air‌ is in its mid-product cycle, however, so it's likely to get the 12-megapixel Ultra Wide front camera in a refresh, perhaps early next year.

*And these are the MOST exciting prospects to watch on each team as we head into camp. [The Athletic]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The new iPhone 13 Pro models support 4K ProRes video recording, but there's a catch if you want to capture video at the highest quality - you need an ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ or Pro Max with at least 256GB of storage space.





On Apple's tech specs page for the new devices and in the press release announcing the new ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ models, Apple says that if you have an ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ or ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ Max with the base 128GB of storage, you'll be limited to shooting 1080p ProRes video at 30 frames per second.



For recording ProRes video at 4K at 30 frames per second, higher 256, 512, or 1TB storage capacities are required.
iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max support ProRes video recording in the Camera app at 1080p 30 fps with the 128GB storage option and up to 4K 30 fps with 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB storage options.
Aimed at professionals, the ProRes codec offers higher color fidelity and less compression, and it is often used for commercials, feature films, and TV broadcasts. With ProRes support, ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ and Pro Max users can capture, edit, and share professional quality video right on their devices.



ProRes support will not be available when the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ models launch and will be coming in a future iOS 15 update.



Along with ProRes, the new ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ and Pro Max offer much improved Wide, Wide Angle, and Telephoto lenses with better low light performance, macro capabilities, Night Mode, Cinematic video recording for depth-of-field transitions, and Photographic Styles for enhancing images.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the announcement of the iPhone 13 mini, ‌iPhone 13‌, iPhone 13 Pro, and ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ Max, Apple is allowing customers to get ready for pre-orders, which are set to take place on Friday, September 17 at 5:00 a.m. Pacific Time.





Existing and new iPhone Upgrade Program members can use the Apple Store app on the iPhone or Apple's website to go through all of the pre-approval steps to get ready to purchase a new ‌iPhone‌, including checking upgrade eligibility, securing credit lines, and confirming other necessary information.



Those who are not members of the ‌iPhone‌ Upgrade Program can also select their preferred ‌iPhone‌, confirm their status with their carrier, add accessories, choose an AppleCare+ plan, and add a preferred payment method to prepare for the ‌iPhone‌ launch. Both payment in full and other payment options are supported.



With this setup process, all customers who go through the "Get Ready" steps will be able to pre-order their devices with the tap of a button on launch day.



Apple has always had the pre-approval process for ‌iPhone‌ Upgrade Program customers, but the new streamlined pre-order preparation for other customers appears to be a new addition.



The ‌iPhone 13‌ models are priced starting at $699, while the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ models are priced starting at $999. Pre-orders begin on Friday, September 17 at 5:00 a.m. Pacific Time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sascha Segan, writing for PCMag:
Well, that was bogus.
Both prominent analyst Ming-chi Kuo and extremely reliable Apple
reporter Mark Gurman got seemingly taken in this year by a rumor
that the new iPhone 13 line would talk to satellites,
something that completely didn’t happen during the company’s
iPhone 13 announcement on Tuesday.
In fact, the iPhone 13 doesn’t even feature 5G band n53, the
ground-based 5G band owned by satellite operator Globalstar, which
I had speculated was the grain of truth in the rumors. So I was
wrong, too. […]
We may never know what really caused those rumors to spark,
but I wonder darkly if it has to do with some sort of stock
pump-and-dump situation. Satellite provider Globalstar’s
stock jumped after Kuo’s report, and now it’s crashing
back to earth.
It’s possible that the iPhones 13 do contain a satellite-connectivity-compatible chip, but Apple made no mention of it as a feature. Gurman was circumspect about whether the feature would actually ship, but Kuo seemingly reported it as fact.

Ubisoft San Francisco has no word on a new launch window
 Rocksmith Plus won’t make the summer 2021 launch window developers originally hoped for, the studio announced on Tuesday. It’ll be using the extra time to work on several core features, using feedback from from a closed beta that took place in June and July.
Lead producer Arthur von Nagel didn’t characterize the news as a delay, however, saying Ubisoft San Francisco “didn’t set a hard date because we wanted the flexibility to react to feedback and to adjust release timelines to match.”
Von Nagel did not say when the game would now launch. The studio will be working on feedback in four areas — song library; audio inputs and note detection; progression and education; UI, search, and content discoverability.
With regard to the song library, “we’re committed to offering over 5,000 songs” at launch, Von Nagel wrote. The closed beta purposefully had a selection of about 500 songs. He went into greater detail about the other three development areas in a message to the community.
“We understand that this delay is disappointing,” Von Nagel wrote. “Every Rocksmith Plus player deserves to easily find the music you care about, to feel a sense of growth and mastery over your instrument, and to trust that the notes you play are heard fairly and accurately.”
Rocksmith Plus was announced in June during E3 2021. The guitar-teaching sim is scheduled to launch on Windows PC first, followed by launches on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. Following that, Rocksmith Plus will come to Android and iOS devices, too.
Rocksmith Plus will be a subscription-based service, with Ubisoft offering $14.99, $39.99, and $99.99 plans for monthly, three months, and annual subscriptions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today indicated that "back-glass only" damage on iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 models is now eligible for repair under AppleCare+ for a reduced fee of $29 in the United States, $39 in Canada, £25 in the UK, or the equivalent in other countries.





Prior to this change, cracked or damaged back glass on an iPhone 12 cost $99 to be repaired if the device was covered by an AppleCare+ plan.



In order to qualify for the $29 repair, the iPhone must be covered by AppleCare+ and have no additional damage beyond the damaged back glass that would prevent Apple from replacing the back glass, such as a bent or dented enclosure.



Back glass repairs at the reduced rate are not available on models older than the iPhone 12, according to Apple. More details are available on the iPhone Repair and Service website and in the newly updated AppleCare+ terms and conditions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to the technical specifications for the iPhone 13, ‌iPhone 13‌ mini, ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro, and ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro Max, all of the devices include dual eSIM support, which is a feature that's new to the iPhone lineup this year.





Dual eSIM support means that the ‌iPhone 13‌ models can use two eSIMs simultaneously rather than just one eSIM and one nano-SIM.



Prior ‌iPhone‌ models like the iPhone 12 had dual-SIM support, but only worked with an eSIM and a physical nano-SIM. The ‌iPhone 13‌ models still support eSIM and nano-SIM, but also support two eSIMs for adopting carrier plans without a physical SIM card.



Apple's ‌iPhone 13‌ models will not ship with a physical SIM card this year and carriers will instead use eSIM capabilities for activation. Because eSIM activation is being used for devices connected to a carrier when ordering, a WiFi connection will be needed for setup. From Apple:

Carrier-connected iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro models will arrive ready to activate with eSIM and can connect to your cellular voice and data service without a physical SIM card. You will need a Wi-Fi connection for setup.



To activate eSIM on an unconnected iPhone, please contact the carrier of your choice when you're ready.


Connecting with a carrier later can be done by inserting a physical SIM or contacting a carrier for eSIM activation.



The ‌iPhone 13‌ models will be available for pre-order on Friday, September 17, and will officially launch on Friday, September 24.

All of the ‌iPhone 13‌ models are heavier than their ‌iPhone 12‌ counterparts, likely due to the larger batteries that are inside and the thickness increase. Weight comparisons are below.



 	
‌iPhone 13‌ mini - 141 grams vs. 135 grams


 	
‌iPhone 13‌ - 174 grams vs. 164 grams


 	
‌iPhone 13‌ Pro - 204 grams vs. 189 grams


 	
‌iPhone 13‌ Pro Max - 240 grams vs. 228 grams




The ‌iPhone 13‌ models are a bit thicker than the iPhone 12 Pro models, which is in line with what we were expecting from rumors. All of the ‌iPhone 13‌ models are 7.65mm thick, up from 7.4mm for the ‌iPhone 12‌ lineup.



Height and width of the new models are the same compared to the ‌iPhone 12‌, but the change in thickness and the new design for the cameras for some models will mean the iPhone 12 cases likely won't fit ‌iPhone 13‌ models.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the launch of the iPhone 13 Pro and ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro Max earlier today, which features ProMotion displays with a variable 120Hz refresh rate, Samsung has come out in an apparent jab to Apple for being late to join the wider industry in adopting higher refresh displays.





In a tweet as the Apple event was underway earlier today, the official Samsung Mobile account tweeted "We’ve been refreshing at 120Hz for a while now..." While Apple has been widely rumored to adopt ProMotion in its iPhone over the past few years, Samsung has only just recently adopted a 120Hz refresh rate. 




We’ve been refreshing at 120Hz for a while now...
— Samsung Mobile US (@SamsungMobileUS) September 14, 2021
 


The first flagship Samsung smartphone to adopt a 120Hz refresh rate was the Galaxy S20, released in March of 2020, meaning Samsung may be slightly exaggerating the timeline in its tweet.



The ‌‌iPhone 13‌‌ Pro and ‌‌iPhone 13‌‌ Pro Max, alongside the ‌‌iPhone 13‌‌ and ‌‌iPhone 13‌‌ mini, feature smaller notches, faster performance, and improved cameras. Catch up on all the announcements from Apple's event today right here on our website.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple's new iPhone 13 models that were released today feature an updated TrueDepth camera and a new design for the notch, which has been slimmed down.





Apple said on stage that the notch is now 20 percent less wide than the notch used in prior models, but comparisons between the iPhone 12 and ‌iPhone 13‌ confirm that the new notch design is just a tad bit taller.



In the overlay above, you can see the size difference in action. The notch is indeed a good bit smaller, and the tiny increase in height is barely noticeable.



The new notch design is in line with rumors that we heard during the beta testing period, which pointed to a design that was more compact and just a tiny bit taller.



Next year, Apple may do away with the notch entirely. Rumors suggest that at least some models will have no notch with a design that instead incorporates a hole-punch cutout for the front-facing camera, with Apple to adopt under-display Face ID.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today began selling certified refurbished models of the Apple TV 4K and Apple TV HD with the redesigned Siri Remote for the first time in the United States, Canada, and many European countries, with prices discounted by around 15% as usual.





In the United States, for example, a refurbished Apple TV 4K with 32GB of storage and the redesigned Siri Remote is priced at $149, compared to $179 brand new. Or, customers can bump up to a refurbished 64GB Apple TV 4K for $169, compared to $199 brand new. Apple is also offering refurbished Apple TV HD models with the redesigned Siri Remote.



Apple says all of its refurbished products are thoroughly cleaned, inspected, and guaranteed to be fully functional, and in many cases, Apple's refurbished products are virtually indistinguishable from brand new products.



The new Apple TV 4K with the redesigned Siri Remote debuted in April, with other key features including Wi-Fi 6 and HDMI 2.1.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For her project Topography of Tears, Rose-Lynn Fisher used a scanning electron microscope to photograph the crystalized patterns of dried human tears. Part of why the images all look different is because tears are made up of varying chemicals depending on why they’re made.
Scientifically, tears are divided into three different types, based on their origin. Both tears of grief and joy are psychic tears, triggered by extreme emotions, whether positive or negative. Basal tears are released continuously in tiny quantities (on average, 0.75 to 1.1 grams over a 24-hour period) to keep the cornea lubricated. Reflex tears are secreted in response to an irritant, like dust, onion vapors or tear gas.
All tears contain a variety of biological substances (including oils, antibodies and enzymes) suspended in salt water, but as Fisher saw, tears from each of the different categories include distinct molecules as well. Emotional tears, for instance, have been found to contain protein-based hormones including the neurotransmitter leucine enkephalin, a natural painkiller that is released when the body is under stress.


This project is also available in book form. (via austin kleon)

Macdonald’s cancer diagnosis was kept secret from the public, but
he battled it for nine years.
Terrible news. Fuck cancer, man.
It’s hard to pick one favorite Macdonald bit, but his portrayal of Turd Ferguson on Celebrity Jeopardy makes me laugh every damn time I watch it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coinciding with the new Apple Watch Series 7 debut, Apple has unveiled some new watch faces that will be exclusive to the new model.





Amongst the new faces are Modular Max, World Time, Contour Face, and Nike Bounce, the latter of which is exclusive to the Series 7 Nike edition.





The Modular Max displays the digital time alongside a single complication, and includes longer complications that display across the screen below, which can show information like the day of the week, outside temperature, heart rate, activity, or quick access to an app.





The Continuum watch face shows the flow of time around the edges and the current hour, while the World Time lets users see all 24 time zones simultaneously, thanks to an external dial that shows the time zones and an inner dial that shows the time in each location.





The new Nike Bounce watch face dynamically animates with a tap of the screen, a scroll of the Digital Crown, or a move of the wrist. Apple says it pairs well with the refreshed Nike Sport Loop, which features the Nike Swoosh and logo text incorporated into the weave of the band. Meanwhile, the Hermes version has numbers that change hour by hour.





‌Apple says that the price of the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌‌ starts at $399 and the new model will be available later this fall. For more on the Series 7 model, check out Apple's original announcement.

The upcoming Apple Watch Series 7 will feature a flat-edged
design, similar to the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro, and the
addition of a new green case color option, according to Apple
leaker Jon Prosser.
Bonus points to Prosser for commissioning 3D renders of a fictional design.
Mark Gurman, two weeks ago:
While last year’s upgrade centered on the blood-oxygen sensor,
this year’s is all about a new design with a flatter display and
edges, a faster processor and slightly larger screens.
Today: A big nope on those flat edges. No always-on display mode for any of the new iPhones, either.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At today's "California Streaming" event, Apple announced a new USB-C Apple Watch charging puck designed specifically with the Series 7 models in mind.





Priced at $29, the Apple Watch Magnetic Fast Charger to USB-C cable can charge an Apple Watch Series 7 33 percent faster than the standard Apple Watch charging puck, reaching an 80 percent charge in 45 minutes.
We wanted to make charging your Apple Watch utterly effortless. And now, it charges up to 33% faster when paired with Apple Watch Series 7, so you can reach 80% charge in about 45 minutes. Simply hold the connector near the back of the watch, where magnets cause it to snap into place automatically. It's a completely sealed system free of exposed contacts. And it's very forgiving, requiring no precise alignment.
To enable the faster charging speeds, the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ has an updated charging architecture inside. The fast charging technology is limited to the Series 7 for this reason.





The new Apple Watch charging puck can be purchased from Apple's website starting today, but the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ models won't be launching until later this fall. When available, the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ will likely ship with the new fast charging cable as it has the same price point as the standard cable.

The new ‌MagSafe‌ Wallet can now give the location where it was last separated from your iPhone in the ‌Find My‌ app:



Designed with both style and function in mind, the new iPhone Leather Wallet with MagSafe is the perfect way to keep your ID and credit cards close at hand. It now supports Find My, so you can be notified of your wallet's last known location if it gets separated from your phone.




Other than new color options, the ‌MagSafe‌ Wallet continues to be made from tanned European leather with the same shielded design that can contain up to three cards. 



The new ‌MagSafe‌ Wallet is compatible with the iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max, as well as the iPhone 13 mini, ‌iPhone 13‌, ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro, and ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro Max.

The new ‌MagSafe‌ Wallet is available now for $59 in Golden Brown, Dark Cherry, Sequoia Green, Midnight, and Wisteria.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At today's "California Streaming" event, Apple introduced refreshed versions of the iPad mini and the low-cost iPad, which was something of a surprise as we were expecting new tablet announcements later in the year. Both the iPad mini 6 and the ‌iPad‌ 9 are available for pre-order starting today, with orders up and live following the conclusion of the event.





The ‌iPad‌ 9, which replaces the eighth-generation version, continues to be priced at $329. It features an A13 chip, up to 256GB of storage, and a new 12-megapixel Ultra Wide front-facing camera that supports Center Stage for video calls. 



Compared to prior versions, it includes sRGB support and a True Tone display, with no improvements to the rear camera. It continues to feature thick bezels and a Touch ID Home button. 



The ‌iPad mini 6‌, priced starting at $499, features a much more significant redesign. The new ‌iPad mini‌ is basically a smaller version of the iPad Air with an 8.3-inch all-display design, slim bezels, and a ‌Touch ID‌ power button. 



It too features a 12-megapixel Ultra Wide front-facing camera with Center Stage, and it can be purchased with up to 256GB of storage. It's equipped with Apple's latest and fastest A15 chip, which is also the chip used in the new iPhone 13 models. 



The ‌iPad mini‌ comes in unique new colors that include pink, purple, space gray, and starlight, while the ‌iPad‌ 9 is available in space gray and silver. 



Both the ‌iPad mini 6‌ and the ‌iPad‌ 9 models will be delivered to customers starting on September 24, which is also the launch date for the new iPhone models.

The new ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌, which comes in larger 41mm and 45mm sizes, features larger displays compared to the Series 6 thanks to smaller bezels. 



Alongside a full keyboard, Apple says it has redesigned the buttons and menus across watchOS to make it easier to tap on the larger displays. Due to reported production issues, the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ will be available later this fall, with no specific date currently given.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As of September 2021, there are over 2.6 million RSS-based podcasts and more than 113 million episodes on the internet.
Basically, there’s a podcast for that. You can learn any topic by listening to podcasts. And it seems that every domain expert has already done some podcast interviews.
Podcasts have become my primary informal learning resource. And I built a podcast search engine (listennotes.com) to help myself listen to ~5,000 podcast episodes in the past 4 years! In this blog post, I’ll share with you my quirky way of podcast discovery and consumption :)

It’s strange and wondrous, and above all, it treats me with respect
 Of the many fantasies humanity has entertained, conquering time has been paramount, whether through time machines, freezing, or reversing. If time is the great consumer, then those that control time control the universe. It is no wonder, then, that the villains of Deathloop have decided to seize time for themselves. 
Arkane Lyon’s latest sandbox adventure deploys a time mechanic like no other game. The studio has created the equivalent of a finely tuned watch. And it’s truly one of the most incredible video game experiences of my life.

The Xbox App can stream from the cloud or your home console
 The Xbox App for Windows 10 PCs will now let players stream console games on their computer, thanks to an update that went live on Tuesday.
The game streaming that the update enables will let Xbox Game Pass subscribers play games that their PCs otherwise might not have the specs to handle. According to Microsoft, playing games directly from an Xbox console with Remote Play will provide the smoothest experience, while using the cloud will be slightly more taxing, but won’t require a download. 
Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers are currently able to stream games in browsers from their phones, tablets, and PCs, but the new option will allow streaming directly into the Windows 10 Xbox App. One thing that isn’t available yet is streaming games directly to Xbox Series X consoles, but Microsoft says that feature’s on the way later this year. 


The cloud option is limited to titles on Xbox Game Pass. Other games that players own may be streamed using Remote Play, because the game is running on the console. 
To stream games to the Xbox App from the cloud, players just need a compatible controller and an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription. Otherwise the Remote Play option is available through the Xbox App on Windows 10 PCs.]]></summary>

Deshommes, who grew up in Haiti, came to New York on a student visa in 1985. He was seventeen years old, and when his visa expired he became undocumented. He lived with an older brother and took classes day and night and through the summer in order to finish high school in two years. “I became a man the moment I set foot on U.S. soil, full of responsibility,” he told me. He started playing the violin a few years later, with teachers at the Harlem School of the Arts. He was soon practicing several hours a day and working long shifts at Pizza Hut. He felt that he was too old to train as a professional, but his practice had become central to his life: “Music was the escape, music was the goal. Music was what made me achieve great things,” he said. “The violin gives me a discipline where I feel I can conquer anything.”

The Germ(?) returns.
 No. 24: German Rubtsov
2020-21 League/Team(s): HK Sochi (KHL)
2020-21 Statistics: 3 G, 8 A, 11 P in 46 GP
Age: 23
Acquired In: 2016 (drafted)
Ranking in Spring 2020 25 Under 25: 12th  
How did Rubtsov’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
The short answer here is that last season was a little underwhelming, to say the least. Rubtsov spent the whole of last season on loan to Sochi of the KHL, and he just never really seemed to get his offensive game rolling. There were some flashes where it looked like things were coming together for him, but we didn’t see it on a consistent basis. 
Now, all of that said, there were some things working against Rubtsov last s…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Image: CD Projekt Red
    

  
Moist, even
 There have been a lot of questions about Cyberpunk 2077 since it launched in December, but none more strange that the one asked by the Polygon video team: Is Cyberpunk 2077 wet enough? We can now safely say that no, in fact, the game clearly launched without the requisite amount of moisture. The latest patch, numbered 1.31, should fix that.
As far as Cyberpunk patches go, this is a pretty small one. There were a few quest bugs that got squashed, but nothing game-breaking it sounds like. The PlayStation got a little “GPU optimization,” so we’ll have to see how that shakes out performance wise. But this update didn’t even come with a mock newscast to herald its arrival. From the description, it sounds like you might not even notice it. “Please note that the issues listed below did not affect all players” CD Projekt said in its preamble. 
But then there’s this note:
Fixed an issue where roads after rain did not look wet, which was the result of ongoing work on the Wet Surfaces System. In 1.31 wet surfaces should look more detailed than they did even before the issue occurred.



As Polygon’s official wet correspondent pointed out in February, Night City should be damp,  its surfaces sodden, and even its smoothest features covered in rivulets of water because that’s how it was described by Mike Pondsmith and the team at R. Talsorian Games when the original tabletop game launched in the 1980s.
“It always rains,” reads the official worldbook. “Every day should be grim, gloomy and overcast. The stars never come out. The sun never shines. There are no singing birds, laughing children. The last bird died in 2008 and the kids are grown in vats. The ozone layer is decayed, the greenhouse effect took over, the sky is full of hydrocarbons and the ocean full of sludge. Nice place.”
So, if anything, CD Projekt’s vision of the gritty urban metropolis is too gritty, and not nearly grimy enough. Today’s patch should fix that. You can find the full patch notes on the official website.]]></summary>

Apple legal battle, Epic was last week ordered by the court to pay 30 percent of the revenue that it collected from the Fortnite app using its illicit direct payment option.





Back at the start of the dispute between Epic and Apple, Epic added a direct purchase option to the Fortnite app, skirting Apple's in-app purchase rules. This violation of Apple's App Store guidelines led Apple to pull Fortnite from the App Store, and directly after that, Epic filed its pre-planned lawsuit.

With new Mac and iPad models also rumored to be on the horizon, Apple reportedly plans to hold at least one additional event before the end of the year, and the company's annual Back to School promotion could provide a clue as to when the next event might take place.





Specifically, on September 15 of last year, Apple extended its Back to School promotion to run through Monday, October 12 in the U.S. At the time, the extension seemed insignificant, but Apple later announced that it would be holding an event on Tuesday, October 13, which happened to be just one day after the promotion ended.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[T-Mobile today announced that its T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile smartphones will soon be available in more than 2,300 Walmart locations across the United States, significantly expanding T-Mobile's footprint.





T-Mobile devices will be listed on Walmart.com, though customers will need to visit a Walmart store to make a purchase. The rollout follows the availability of T-Mobile devices in Best Buy retail stores and the Best Buy website earlier this year.



Prior to becoming available in Walmart and Best Buy, T-Mobile iPhones were only available from Apple or direct from T-Mobile's website and stores, which prevented customers from taking advantage of deals offered by brick and mortar retailers.
"In many parts of the country, limited competition when it comes to wireless service leaves some people with few options for plans or access to the benefits of 5G," said Jon Freier, Executive Vice President, T-Mobile Consumer Group. "5G for All means T-Mobile is bringing real choice and competition in wireless to many Americans. And even though online shopping continues to grow, we know that retail stores remain one of the primary places where wireless customers pick up devices and service. We're working to expand our retail footprint across the country to meet more people in more places every day."
Metro by T-Mobile smartphone displays will be available in Walmart retail locations on Monday, October 18. Standard T-Mobile smartphones and plans will be available in Walmart stores starting on Monday, November 1.

Respawn pumps the brakes on plans to wipe out keyboard-and-mouse tactic
 Apex Legends developers are putting brakes on their plans to eliminate “tap-strafing,” a movement meta-tactic skilled players use to be even more mobile. The studio on Monday said it had “discovered some unexpected side effects” and is “delaying our planned change to a later patch.”
“After further testing, we’ve concluded we need to take more time to get this right to make sure related movement mechanics aren’t caught in the crossfire,” Respawn Entertainment wrote on Twitter.
On Aug. 31, Respawn said tap-strafing’s days were numbered. The move is a hard turn, executed in midair, which is commonly used by keyboard-and-mouse players on Apex Legends’ PC version. The i…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The AI-powered fitness gym "Tempo" today announced integration with the Apple Watch, allowing Tempo customers to sync their workouts and fitness and health data directly to their Apple Watch.





Amongst its demographic of users, Tempo says that more than 70% are iPhone users, with a smaller 35% owning an Apple Watch. Tempo had been teasing Apple Watch integration for some time, and with it finally arriving, Tempo customers now have access to a host of settings, features, and data right on their wrist. During workouts, for example, customers can pause and resume sessions without needing to touch the Tempo display, minimizing distractions and wasted time. 



More importantly, Apple Watch integration means that Tempo customers will no longer need to rely on third-party or external health monitoring equipment during their workouts. Using the built-in sensors on the Apple Watch, Tempo customers can now access their heart rate, calorie burn, and additional data synced with their Tempo workouts.



For those unfamiliar with Tempo, the company calls itself "the only home gym with interactive coaching" that uses 3D sensors with advanced AI technology to help customers perfect their form and workouts during training. Tempo offers not only real-time feedback but also coaching and "premium" dumbells worth upwards of $1,000.

But it does make for good meme fodder
 Streamers broadcasting Life is Strange: True Colors to their audiences are feeling awkward about the lack of music in the game’s streamer mode. The tool itself is designed to mute any copyrighted music that might set off DMCA takedown notices on streaming platforms like Twitch or YouTube — and it does exactly that. Some streamers were surprised to find out, however, that there’s no music to replace what’s been muted.
That makes some seems a bit awkward. Like, for instance, when True Colors star Alex Chen is singing a Radiohead song. As Alex strums away on her guitar in an emotional scene the day she’s reunited with her brother, there’s simply no sound. Alex may think she’s a creep (heh) but we can’t hear it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple today released iOS 14.8, marking the eighth major update to the iOS operating system that came out in September 2020. iOS 14.8 comes two months after the release of iOS 14.7, an update that introduced MagSafe Battery Pack support.





The iOS 14.8 update can be downloaded for free and the software is available on all eligible devices over-the-air in the Settings app. To access the new software, go to Settings > General > Software Update. Apple has also released a new version if iPadOS 14. 



According to Apple's release notes, iOS 14.8 is a security-focused update that is recommended for all users. Apple's security support document outlines two major fixes that have been implemented for issues that Apple says may have been actively exploited. 



There is a CoreGraphics bug that could allow a maliciously crafted PDF to lead to arbitrary code execution, as well as a WebKit vulnerability that could allow maliciously crafted web content to execute code.



iOS 14.8 could one of the final updates to the iOS 14 operating system as we're expecting the iOS 15 update to be released in just a couple of weeks, but Apple has said that it plans to allow people to keep using iOS 14 if they don't want to upgrade to ‌iOS 15‌. For that reason, ‌iOS 14‌ may continue to get small security updates over time, but new features will likely be limited to ‌iOS 15‌.



Update 10:16 a.m.: Apple has also released watchOS 7.6.2 with similar security fixes for Apple Watch Series 3 and later.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Wire creator David Simon wrote about his friend and colleague Michael K. Williams, who died suddenly last week at the age of 54. The Question Michael K. Williams Asked Me Before Every Season of ‘The Wire’:
And from that moment forward, his questions about our drama and its purposes were those of someone sharing the whole of the journey. It became something of a ritual with us: To begin every season that followed, Michael K. Williams would walk into the writers’ office and sit on the couch.
“So,” he would ask, “what are we going to say this year?”
He gave us an astounding gift — an act of faith from a magnificent actor who could have played his hand very differently. Television usually chases its audience — if they love them some Omar, you feed them more Omar. If they can’t stop looking at Stringer, you write more Stringer. Never mind story and theme.
Instead, Mike bent his beautiful mind to a task that even the best writers and show runners often avoid. He thought about the whole story, the whole of the work.
Perhaps more than any in that talented cast, I came to trust Mike to speak publicly to our drama and its purposes, to take personal pride in all that we were trying, however improbably, to build. He became increasingly political as the show aged, and in interviews took to addressing societal and political issues, his arguments ranging well beyond Omar’s arc.
“I started to realize that, oh, this is not about me,” Williams once told an interviewer, looking back. “It had everything to do with … just great tapestry, this great narrative of social issues … things that are wrong in our country.”

 Flyers fans, our long national nightmare is over:

Also Danny Trejo and his obligatory machete
 Far Cry 6’s post-launch content plans involve two crossover missions that jibe with the game’s setting and story, but the third — yet probably the most popular — collab sticks out like a gratuitous product placement: Players will venture into The Upside Down of Stranger Things, to save the little wiener dog you’ve seen in the preview trailers.
At least it’s free. Advertorials should be, after all. Players will also get the obligatory Danny Trejo cameo (con el machete, of course), and a Rambo mission series whose premise sounds like it kinda works? Rambo himself doesn’t drop into the game — it’s a Yaran superfan who, despite the near total cutoff of the island (vis-a-vis Cuba), has followed the 1980s action series and become obsessed with the character.


The three crossovers, coming post launch, led off a roadmap video Ubisoft posted on Friday. Players will also get, free from day one, weekly cooperative multiplayer operations — they’re “insurgencies” and “special ops.”
Of course, this is a Ubisoft joint, so there’s a season pass with premium post-launch stuff, too. As mentioned before, you’ll be going inside the minds of Pagan Min, Vaas, and Joseph Seed to learn more about how those three got so messed up. Expect a lot of surrealism, and a lot of dying, but also a lot of loot?
Far Cry 6 launches Oct. 7 for Amazon Luna, Google Stadia, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. The game was originally due in February, but was delayed as Ubisoft adjusted its COVID-19 development plans. Far Cry 6 stars Giancarlo Esposito as top bad guy Anton Castillo, and the player is Dani Rojas (not the Ted Lasso character, btw), who becomes a guerrilla army of one against the dictator.]]></summary>

Apple typically drives a fleet of vehicles around the world to collect Maps data, including street-level imagery for its Look Around feature, but it conducts pedestrian surveys "in areas where vehicles simply can't go." Apple promises that the pedestrian surveys offer the "same privacy protections as the Apple Maps vehicles."



A list of locations maintained on Apple's website reveals that the company began the pedestrian surveys in Toronto, Montréal, and Vancouver on September 11. Apple will also be surveying the Region of Durham immediately east of Toronto.



Apple says it is committed to protecting the public's privacy while conducting these surveys. In line with Google's Street View, Apple censors faces and license plates in imagery made available through its Look Around feature. If you have comments or questions about this process, your privacy rights, or would like to request that a face, license plate, or your own house be censored, Apple says to email mapsimagecollection@apple.com.



Introduced in iOS 13, Look Around provides 3D street-level imagery that can be zoomed and panned. The feature is already available in Canada, but Apple periodically revisits some locations "in an effort to maintain a high-quality, up-to-date map." Look Around is also available in parts of the United States, UK, Ireland, and Japan.

While Apple is planning to hold an event this week, it won't include everything Apple's expected to announce before the year ends. 





On Tuesday, September 14, Apple will be holding its "California streaming" event, which is expected to include the release of the brand new iPhone 13, Apple Watch Series 7, and possibly the third-generation AirPods. 



Given we're expecting several new products before the end of the year, it's important to note that this single event, out of what is likely to be at least two events of this fall, will not include the launch of everything we're expecting. Here's a quick run…]]></summary>

Arkane Studios once again pays homage to its lineage
 Deathloop mines a vast array of aesthetic sources, from the medieval architecture of Germany’s Northeim district, to Robin Hardy’s The Wicker Man, to the vibrant fashion of Pierre Cardin. As with all of developer Arkane’s games, it combines divergent inspirations to create a singular universe of its own. And as with all of Arkane’s releases, Deathloop wouldn’t exist were it not for a defunct, and criminally overlooked, game studio from the ’90s. And an Easter egg in its opening moments pays homage to that lineage.

Eight birds, one stone.
 Deathloop prides itself on intelligence, in both senses of the word. That is, “the ability to apply knowledge to manipulate one’s environment” and “information concerning an enemy or possible enemy or an area.” There is also a third layer: Intelligence in Deathloop is both diegetic and non-diegetic, as the game’s plot relies on the skills, plotting, and planning of the player character Colt, as well as the skills, plotting, and planning of the player themselves. Watching a character “be” clever is fun, but there is nothing quite like putting the final puzzle piece in yourself and watching the trap you set perform like a finely tuned watch.

The new battle pass also has a cartoon fish and a couple of new Anthropomorphic animals
 The dust has settled from Fortnite’s latest in-game event, and Chapter 2 season 8 has begun, which means there’s a new battle pass full of cosmetics to unlock. 
This time around, the highlight skin is Carnage, the notorious Spider-Man foe, and the villain of the upcoming movie Venom: Let There Be Carnage. Along with his new outfit, Carnage also gets several other cosmetics like a glider, and a trail. Perhaps his coolest feature is the Carnage harvesting tool, which just grows out of his arm thanks to his symbiote powers.

The pass also includes several other skins including Torin, the monster hunter, and J.B. Chimpanski, who is organizing the war effort against this season’s Cube threat. There’s also Fabio Sparklemane, a rainbow-themed anthropomorphic horse, and Charlotte, who gets her own katana harvesting tool. The pass also include a skin called Toona Fish that starts out black and white, but will let you add your own splashes of color later on. 
Fortnite’s latest battle pass is available now and can be purchased for 950 V-Bucks ($9.50). There’s also a free version of the battle pass which allows players to unlock certain rewards and continue to gain experience. The free version of the pass can be upgraded at anytime to the full version without losing any progress. The paid version of the pass also gives players access to all of the challenges, while the free version only offers a limited number.]]></summary>

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *Just as it was starting to feel like hockey season was in the cool, crisp air... the infamous Second Summer has returned. Alas; we’ve got a few weeks before Fall and a few weeks before the real hockey begins, so enjoy the heat while we have it. Also, enjoy this lovely look at what got Homer into the USA Hockey Hall of Fame last week. [Flyers]
*We’re continuing to work through our player reviews for last season heading into this season, and since we are toward the end we’re getting to the good bits, like Ivan Provorov. [BSH]
*Yeah, the really good bits like uh... Nicolas Aube-Kubel. The real meaty stuff, like 4th liners. [BSH]
*We’re all excited for the Flyers season to get started, but none of us is as excited as Derick Brassard. [NBC Sports Philly]
*This is not at all about the Flyers, but it’s an interesting think piece on what it means to manage expectations heading into the hockey season. [Hockey Wilderness]
*And finally, goalie masks are super cool, and the people that make them are even cooler. Taking a peek behind the curtain? The coolest. [The Athletic]]]></summary>

The return of Kevin and the Cubes
 Fortnite is heading into a new season and the Cubes have taken over the island. After the massive season 7-ending Operation: Sky Fire event, where Dr. Slone betrayed the island’s defenders, the Cubes are spreading across the island. But no one knows why. 
The arrival of this new threat on the island provides most of the mechanical changes for Fortnite Chapter 2 season 8. The new season includes changes to points of interest, new realities to explore, and augmented weapons.
One of the big new additions for season 8 is The Sideways, a new dimension that features lower gravity and various obstacles that make building a little harder. This should encourage players who are inside to always stay on the move. The Sideways also has a fe…]]></summary>

The ruling, announced on Friday, sided with Apple on nine out of the ten counts that ‌Epic Games‌ had presented against the company. Epic, from the start, had alleged that Apple is anti-competitive and that it should open up its devices to third-party app stores, third-party in-app payment methods, and more. The judge said that while the trial showed that Apple "is engaging in anticompetitive conduct under California’s competition laws," ‌Epic Games‌ failed to prove the company is an illegal monopolist or that it violates anti-trust laws.

Responding to a query about new Macs, Gurman tweeted that "there will be two events," and said he expected the latter to feature both new Mac models and new iPads. In his latest "Power On" newsletter, Gurman said the second event will happen in the next "several weeks."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You’ll read nothing better — or more prescient — about 9/11 than Hunter S. Thompson’s column for ESPN, written 24 hours after the attack:
The towers are gone now, reduced to bloody rubble, along with all
hopes for Peace in Our Time, in the United States or any other
country. Make no mistake about it: We are At War now — with
somebody — and we will stay At War with that mysterious Enemy for
the rest of our lives.
It will be a Religious War, a sort of Christian Jihad, fueled by
religious hatred and led by merciless fanatics on both sides. It
will be guerrilla warfare on a global scale, with no front lines
and no identifiable enemy. Osama bin Laden may be a primitive
“figurehead” — or even dead, for all we know — but whoever put
those All-American jet planes loaded with All-American fuel into
the Twin Towers and the Pentagon did it with chilling precision
and accuracy. The second one was a dead-on bullseye. Straight into
the middle of the skyscraper.
Nothing — even George Bush’s $350 billion “Star Wars” missile
defense system — could have prevented Tuesday’s attack, and it
cost next to nothing to pull off. Fewer than 20 unarmed Suicide
soldiers from some apparently primitive country somewhere on the
other side of the world took out the World Trade Center and half
the Pentagon with three quick and costless strikes on one day. The
efficiency of it was terrifying.
We are going to punish somebody for this attack, but just who or
what will be blown to smithereens for it is hard to say. Maybe
Afghanistan, maybe Pakistan or Iraq, or possibly all three at
once. Who knows? Not even the Generals in what remains of the
Pentagon or the New York papers calling for WAR seem to know who
did it or where to look for them.
The good Dr. Thompson’s voice is sorely missed today.

Kuo envisions two possible scenarios for how Apple treats the ‌AirPods‌ lineup following the launch of the new model. In the first scenario, Kuo says Apple may price the third-generation ‌AirPods‌ higher than the current second-generation ‌AirPods‌, keeping the existing model in the line. 



Secondly, Apple may reduce the price of the existing ‌AirPods‌ and replace their spot in the lineup with the third-generation ‌AirPods‌ at the current $199 price point. Either way, Kuo says Apple will keep …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apoorva Mandavilli, reporting for The New York Times back on August 18:
Together, the new studies indicate overall that vaccines have an
effectiveness of roughly 55 percent against all infections, 80
percent against symptomatic infection, and 90 percent or higher
against hospitalization, noted Ellie Murray, an epidemiologist at
Boston University.
“Those numbers are actually very good,” Dr. Murray said. “The only
group that these data would suggest boosters for, to me, is the
immunocompromised.” […]
Dr. Murray said a booster shot would undoubtedly boost immunity in
an individual, but the added benefit may be minimal — and
obtained just as easily by wearing a mask, or avoiding indoor
dining and crowded bars.
This is like saying we don’t need air bags in addition to seat belts, because the eq…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Beth Mole, reporting for Ars Technica:
COVID-19 vaccines are largely holding up against the
hyper-transmissible delta coronavirus variant, particularly when
it comes to preventing severe disease and death, according to
three studies published Friday by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention. […]
In terms of infections, fully vaccinated people were about 11
times less likely to get an infection in the pre-delta period,
compared with the unvaccinated (with a 95 percent confidence
interval of 7.8 to 15.8). That ratio dropped to 4.6 less likely in
the post-delta period (with a 95 percent confidence interval of
2.5 to 8.5).
For hospitalizations prior to delta, fully vaccinated people were
13 times less likely to wind up in the hospital than the
unvaccinated (confidence interval of 11.3 to 15.6). After delta,
that ratio dropped slightly to 10 times less likely (confidence
interval of 8.1 to 13.3). The fully vaccinated were 16.6 times
less likely to die of COVID-19 prior to delta (confidence interval
of 13.5 to 20.4) and 11.3 times less likely to die after delta
(confidence interval of 9.1 to 13.9).
Donald McNeil — the award-winning science reporter formerly of The New York Times — writing a month ago:
Confusion about mask rules is now so great that enforcement
anywhere but on airplanes will be impossible. Requiring weekly
tests as a substitute for vaccination is doomed to fail because
the Delta variant can turn someone from healthy to superspreader
in less than four days.
The key to saving lives is vaccine. The key to reopening offices
and factories is vaccine. The key to reopening schools is vaccine.
The key to keeping bars and restaurants open in cold weather is
vaccine. The key to travel and shopping is vaccine. Vaccine in
everybody.

We're continuing to see a flurry of rumors about not only the iPhone 13 and Apple Watch Series 7 that we're expecting to see at the event, but also the iPhone 14 that's a whole year away.





The other major piece of news this week was that a decision was finally handed down in the blockbuster Epic Games v. Apple trial. It was a mixed verdict with Apple winning on nine of the ten counts but the sole Epic victory meaning that U.S. developers would be able to link to alternative payment systems in their apps. But stay tuned, because this dispute isn't over yet.

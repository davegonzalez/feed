                    <span>Wes Anderson’s tenth film, The French Dispatch, is about a fictional magazine published by a group of Americans in France. The movie’s magazine is based on the New Yorker and in advance of its release, Anderson has published an anthology of articles from the actual New Yorker (and other magazines) that inspired the characters in the film. It’s called An Editor’s Burial.
A glimpse of post-war France through the eyes and words of 14 (mostly) expatriate journalists including Mavis Gallant, James Baldwin, A.J. Liebling, S.N. Behrman, Luc Sante, Joseph Mitchell, and Lillian Ross; plus, portraits of their editors William Shawn and New Yorker founder Harold Ross. Together: they invented modern magazine journalism.

                    <span>Oh, I really like this new NYC subway mosaic installed in the corridor between Times Square and Bryant Park designed by Nick Cave.1 It’s based on Cave’s Soundsuits project, full-body suits that “camouflage the shape of the wearer, enveloping and creating a second skin that hides gender, race, and class, thus compelling the audience to watch without judgment”. From a NY Times piece on the mosaic:
The Soundsuits have always been an amalgam of cultural references, Cave explained: the concepts of shamans and masquerade, obscuring the race, gender and class of the wearer and forging a new identity. They contain ties to Africa, the Caribbean and Haiti.
“It’s very important that you can make references, you can connect to something,” Cave said. “In one of the mosaics in the corridor, there’s a sneaker. So that brings it to this urban, right-now time.”
From beneath a pink-and-black cloak of raffia, carefully crafted out of glass shards, pokes a contemporary sneaker in shades of salmon, white and maroon. Cave likes the play that’s happening here: The form is sometimes figurative, sometimes abstract. “Sometimes it’s identifiable and sometimes it’s not,” he said. “But that’s the beauty of it all.”

No, not that Nick Cave.↩

                    <span>A new unique #AppleEvent &quot;hashflag&quot; has surfaced on Twitter for next week&#x27;s &quot;California Streaming&quot; all-digital Apple event to increase visibility and maximize hype on the social media network.





The custom Twitter hashtag includes a multi-colored Apple logo, and it&#x27;s live as of 1:00 p.m. Pacific Time. 



Apple has used the little icons next to hashtags on Twitter for all its previous events since late last year. The company&#x27;s first use of a hashflag was for its September 2020 event, when it announced the iPad Air and Apple Watch.



Twitter allows brands to add the custom emojis next to hashtags as a marketing strategy. According to Agency Creative, each one can cost upwards of one million dollars, and they are commonly used for large events like the Super Bowl or holidays.



Apple&#x27;s event is set to take place on Tuesday, September 14, where it is expected to announce the new iPhone 13 lineup alongside the Apple Watch Series 7.

                    <span>Doug Field, Apple&#x27;s Vice President of Special Projects, is leaving Apple and abandoning his work on the Apple Car in favor of a position at Ford, Ford announced today.





Field has jumped from company to company in recent years, and since 2018, he has been leading ‌Apple Car‌ development alongside Bob Mansfield and John Giannandrea, who took over leadership for the project in late 2020. Prior to joining Apple in 2018, Field worked at Tesla and oversaw the production of the Model 3.



Before working at Tesla, Field was Apple&#x27;s Vice President of Mac Hardware Engineering, so this is the second time he has departed the Cupertino company. In total, he spent eight and a half years at Apple.

                    <span>One of the splashier car introductions for this year is the relaunch of the iconic Jeep Wagoneer brand as an all-new full-size SUV to compete against the likes of the Cadillac Escalade and Lincoln Navigator. The new 2022 Jeep Wagoneer is also available as a Grand Wagoneer, but rather than being a larger version of an already large SUV, the &quot;Grand&quot; designation is used to represent higher trim lines and some minor changes to styling.





Jeep invited me up to New York City recently to take a look at the Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer, which have gone all-in on technology with up to nine LCD screens scattered throughout the vehicle and new Fire TV integration that takes rear entertainment to the next level. And of course, there&#x27;s wireless CarPlay through the beefed-up Uconnect 5 infotainm…</span>

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/07/apple-releases-revised-airtags-firmware-2/">

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Apple today released a second revised version of the AirTags firmware that was first provided to ‌AirTags‌ owners in late August. The new internal build number is 1A291e, up from 1A291c from the prior revision.





There&#x27;s no word on what&#x27;s included in the new firmware and no new features were found following the first release, so it likely focuses on bug fixes and other under-the-hood improvements.



Apple does not provide an option to force an AirTag update, as it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s done over-the-air through a connected iPhone. To make sure the update happens, you can put your AirTag in range of your ‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌, but you have to wait for the firmware to roll out to your device.



For AirTag firmware releases, Apple appears to have a system that limits the number of people who see the update with each deployment to meter the rollout of the software. Today&#x27;s firmware update jumps to a 25 percent rollout level, up from 10 percent with the prior version of the firmware. 



You can check your current AirTag firmware version using the Find My app, with instructions available in our how to.

                    <span>Hulu today informed customers that it is planning to raise the price of its ad-supported and ad-free on-demand plans by $1, an increase that will impact both new and existing subscribers.





The ad-supported plan, which costs $5.99, is going up to $6.99 per month, while the ad-free plan will be priced at $12.99, up from $11.99. The pricing changes are set to go into effect on October 8.



Pricing on the Disney Bundle that includes access to Hulu ad-supported content, Disney+, and ESPN+ is not changing, and it will continue to be available for $13.99. The Disney Bundle with ad-free Hulu is still $19.99.



Now that there&#x27;s a $1 price difference between the ad-free Hulu subscription and the lower tier Disney Bundle, customers may be more willing to choose the Disney bundle to get access to all three Disney streaming services. As Variety points out, the bundle now provides a 36 percent discount compared to separate subscriptions.



The Hulu + Live TV plans are also not changing in price at this time and continue to start at $64.99 per month.



Hulu has never before raised the price of its ad-supported tier, and in 2019, dropped the cost from $7.99 per month to $5.99 per month. Hulu is still competitively priced with Netflix, which is priced starting at $8.99 for a basic plan and goes all the way up to $17.99 per month for the premium tier.

                    <span>Apple today seeded the ninth beta of the upcoming tvOS 15 update to developers for testing purposes, with the new beta coming one week released the eighth beta.





Developers can download the new tvOS 15 beta by downloading a profile onto the ‌Apple TV‌ using Xcode.



Apple shared little about tvOS 15 when it was unveiled, but there are some new features that are coming to the operating system. SharePlay, a FaceTime feature that lets multiple users watch TV shows or movies together, will integrate with tvOS, and there&#x27;s a new &quot;For All of You&quot; recommendation engine that suggests shows everyone might enjoy.



A Shared With You section also displays movies and shows that were shared with you through the Messages app so you remember to check them out. When paired with AirPods Pro or AirPods Max, the ‌Apple TV‌ supports Spatial audio for a theater-like surround sound experience, and there&#x27;s a new feature for automatically connecting your AirPods through Smart ‌AirPods‌ routing.



Hey Siri commands can be used to launch Apple TV+ shows, and two HomePod mini speakers can be paired with the ‌Apple TV‌ 4K for stereo sound. If you have HomeKit cameras, you can also now view multiple cameras at the same time on the ‌Apple TV‌.

                    <span>Apple this morning announced a digital-only event that will be held on Tuesday, September 14, and if you view the event webpage on an iPhone, you can tap on the logo to open up Apple&#x27;s Safari AR viewer and you&#x27;ll see the three-dimensional logo move in real-time in the real world.





Just open up the event site on an ‌iPhone‌ or iPad and tap right on the logo to open up the AR version. The graphic Apple is using for the event reflects the shining outline of the Apple logo seen in the event invite, and you can use AR to tunnel through it, where a starry night lake scene and the event date are revealed.



Apple often creates graphical experiences for its events, with AR being at the center of recent efforts. In the past, it also had an October iPad event where it created dozens of different Apple logos, and people often analyze event art designs to decipher possible signs of what to expect when it comes to product announcements.

                    <span>Apple today announced that it will be holding a special event on Tuesday, September 14 at 10:00 a.m. The event will take place at the Steve Jobs Theater on the Apple Park campus in Cupertino, California.





As with WWDC and last year&#x27;s fall events, this new event will be held digitally with no members of the media invited to attend in person. Apple will likely provide pre-taped segments for each new product that&#x27;s announced.



Last year&#x27;s September event focused on the Apple Watch after the iPhone was delayed until October, but this year, things are back to normal. We&#x27;re expecting Apple to announce new iPhone 13 models, the Apple Watch Series 7, and possibly the AirPods 3.

                    <span>Only six percent of iPhone users in the United States who have Apple Pay set up actually use the feature, according to a detailed study by PYMNTS.





Seven years after ‌Apple Pay‌ launched in September 2014, 93.9 percent of consumers with ‌Apple Pay‌ activated on their ‌iPhone‌ do not use it to pay for in-store purchases, meaning that only 6.1 percent do.



In 2015, the year following ‌Apple Pay‌&#x27;s launch, PYMNTS found that ‌Apple Pay‌ usage was just 5.1 percent among those that had the feature activated. This means that ‌Apple Pay‌ usage has only increased by one percentage point in six years.

                    <span>The UK mobile carrier Sky is today teasing the launch of &quot;the next generation,&quot; in what may be a hint at the seemingly impending launch of the iPhone 13 lineup.





The company&#x27;s webpage says that &quot;the next generation is about to land&quot; in an &quot;upcoming big announcement,&quot; and encourages customers to sign up before Tuesday, September 14, to get access to an exclusive Sky Mobile offer.



The promotion has attracted interest since all indications are pointing to Apple planning to hold a digital event on September 14 to announce the ‌iPhone 13‌, Apple Watch Series 7, and third-generation AirPods, which is the same day that the early-bird Sky Mobile offer ends. There is no other sign from Sky that the offer relates to the ‌iPhone 13‌.




We think it&#x27;s time to treat yourself to something new 👀
Sky Mobile customers: if there&#x27;s one good choice you make today, let it be registering your interest to to get all the info on the upcoming announcement, trust us 🎁

Some carriers have been known to provide discounted offers to customers who sign up to a contract for a next-generation iPhone model before it is officially announced, and this marketing appears to be in line with those similar promotions in the past. It is also possible that the announcement relates to something else entirely, but the September 14 date is sufficient proof for some observers that it relates to the ‌iPhone 13‌ lineup.



If the ‌iPhone 13‌ is set to be unveiled next week on September 14 as rumors suggest, invites would likely be sent out later today.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>WhatsApp is working on giving users the option to adjust the visibility of their &quot;Last Seen&quot; status on a contact-by-contact basis, according to a new report from forthcoming-feature specialist WABetaInfo.





As regular WhatsApp users will know, the &quot;Last Seen&quot; status of a contact sits atop the conversation thread, informing you when that contact last opened and was active on the app.



Currently, you can disable your &quot;Last Seen&quot; status so that other contacts can&#x27;t see when you were last online, but the setting&#x27;s options are limited to &quot;Everyone,&quot; &quot;My Contacts,&quot; and &quot;Nobody,&quot; and there&#x27;s no way to make exceptions for individual contacts.



However, that looks set to change, based on options unearthed by WABetaInfo in a beta version of WhatsApp. In the Privacy settings, the messaging platform is adding the option &quot;My Contacts Except...&quot; which will let you select specific contacts so that they don&#x27;t see when the last time was that you were active on the messaging network. 





Although it&#x27;s worth noting that if you disable your last seen status for specific contacts, you won&#x27;t be able to see theirs either.



The new &quot;My Contacts Except...&quot; option is also evident in the privacy settings for a user&#x27;s profile picture and &quot;About&quot; information, indicating WhatsApp&#x27;s intention to bring more granular settings to the app&#x27;s privacy options as a whole.



As usual, it&#x27;s unclear when the new options will go live, but given they were discovered on iOS, expect them to appear on iPhone first, with the Android version to follow.

                    <span>Sofia Coppola&#x27;s Apple TV+ comedy &quot;On the Rocks&quot; will be released on Blu-Ray and DVD next month, the first ‌Apple TV+‌ movie to be made available on physical media.





First revealed by Sigmund Judge, &quot;On the Rocks&quot; can be pre-ordered now on Amazon for $17.99. According to the Blu-Ray version information, the physical disc is being distributed by Lionsgate and will ship from October 26, 2021, meaning its exclusivity will no longer be through ‌‌Apple TV+‌‌ on Apple&#x27;s devices and supported TVs and streaming boxes.



&quot;On the Rocks&quot; stars Rashida Jones, Bill Murray, and Marlon Wayans, and tells the story of Laura, a young mother in New York faced with sudden doubts about her marriage.



Laura teams up with her impulsive father Felix, who insists they investigate the situation, leading to an adventure across the city and a generational clash about how people see relationships differently from their parents.



Coppola and Murray last collaborated on 2003&#x27;s &quot;Lost in Translation,&quot; which won Coppola an Academy Award for original screenplay and earned Murray an Oscar nomination for Best Actor.



The only other ‌Apple TV+‌ original available for customers to purchase on Blu-ray and DVD is the drama series &quot;Defending Jacob,&quot; which made the jump to physical media in July, courtesy of Paramount.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/07/anker-nano-pro-20w-adapter/">

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Last October, Anker debuted its 20-watt Anker Nano power adapter, a high-speed charger only slightly larger than Apple&#x27;s standard 5-watt adapter. Ahead of the iPhone 13 launch, Anker today is introducing a refresh for its Anker Nano, which arrives under the name of Anker Nano Pro and comes in four color options: black, white, blue, and purple.





The Anker Nano Pro has a single USB-C port and essentially the same baseline specs as the Anker Nano, but some of the internals have been tweaked to optimize performance and Anker&#x27;s ActiveShield safety system features advanced temperature monitoring and power output control to help protect your device while it&#x27;s fast charging.





The color options for the Anker Nano Pro are part of what Anker says is a &quot;new direction&quot; for the company that will see it expanding beyond the basic black and white options it&#x27;s used on most of its products over the years. Other recent colorful product additions for Anker include the lavender grey and mint green versions of the original Anker Nano, several color options for its PowerLine cables, and even the MagSafe-compatible PowerCore Magnetic 5K.



For those looking for a bit more versatility in Anker&#x27;s lineup of diminutive power adapters, the company is also working on a Nano Pro Dual that will feature 40 watts of charging power and two ports. More information and a launch date for that model will be coming at a later date.



The single-port Anker Nano Pro is available now from Amazon and is priced at $19.99.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/07/magsafe-charger-filing-new-iphones/">

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Apple has referenced four unreleased iPhones in an updated FCC filing for its MagSafe charger, while at the same time referencing the currently released iPhone 12 lineup as &quot;legacy&quot; iPhones. 





The new filing doesn&#x27;t reveal any details about a possible update to the ‌MagSafe‌ charger; instead, the filing only includes updated testing based on new equipment. In the equipment section of the filing, Apple lists four &quot;New Phone&quot; items while also listing A2176, A2172, A2341, and A2342, which correspond to the iPhone 12 mini, ‌iPhone 12‌, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max, respectively, as &quot;legacy&quot; devices.



Earlier in the summer, Apple registered four new iPhone models in the EEC database, providing us with model IDs for the upcoming iPhones. However, today&#x27;s new filing doesn&#x27;t include any model numbers for the &quot;New Phone&quot; items, making it difficult to tie a connection between the filing and the EEC entry.



Amongst the features expected for the iPhone 13, Apple is expected to be improving the strength of the MagSafe magnets on the back of the new iPhones. While the filing doesn&#x27;t confirm that, Apple may have needed to retest the charger as per FCC regulation on the new iPhones, given their stronger ‌MagSafe‌ system than the 2020 lineup. 



Apple is widely expected to be holding an all-digital event next week on Tuesday, September 14, where it will announce the ‌iPhone 13‌ as well as the Apple Watch Series 7. Apple may confirm the event as early as Tuesday.

                    <span>Michael Wayland, reporting for CNBC:
Ford Motor said Tuesday it hired former Tesla and Apple executive
Doug Field to lead its emerging technology efforts, a key focus
for the automaker under its new Ford+ turnaround plan.
Field — who led development of Tesla’s Model 3 — most recently
served as vice president of special projects at Apple, which
reportedly included the tech giant’s Titan car project.
The hire is a major addition for Ford and a big hit to Apple
and its secret car project, which the company has yet to
confirm exists.
Maybe it’s as simple as Field wanting to work on something that’s actually going to ship?

                    <span>David Leonhardt, writing for The New York Times:
The estimates here are based on statistics from three places that
have reported detailed data on Covid infections by vaccination
status: Utah; Virginia; and King County, which includes Seattle,
in Washington state. All three are consistent with the idea that
about one in 5,000 vaccinated Americans have tested positive for
Covid each day in recent weeks.
The chances are surely higher in the places with the worst Covid
outbreaks, like the Southeast. And in places with many fewer
cases — like the Northeast, as well as the Chicago, Los Angeles
and San Francisco areas — the chances are lower, probably less
than 1 in 10,000. That’s what the Seattle data shows, for
example. (These numbers don’t include undiagnosed cases, which
are often so mild that people do not notice them and do not pass
the virus to anyone else.)
Here’s one way to think about a one-in-10,000 daily chance: It
would take more than three months for the combined risk to reach
just 1 percent.
Breakthrough cases for the vaccinated are far more rare than many people have been led to believe through clickbait headlines.

                    <span>Karen Webster, writing for the oddly-named Pymnts:
Seven years post-launch, new PYMNTS data shows that 93.9% of
consumers with Apple Pay activated on their iPhones do not use it
in-store to pay for purchases.
That means only 6.1% do.
That finding is based on PYMNTS’ national study of 3,671 U.S.
consumers conducted between Aug. 3-10, 2021. After seven years,
Apple Pay’s adoption and usage isn’t much larger than it was 2015
(5.1%), a year after its launch, and is the same as it was in
2019, the last full year before the pandemic.
It doesn’t really make sense to me that adoption isn’t much higher than it was in 2015, and if these survey results are accurate, I find them surprisingly low. I’d have guessed somewhere in the 15–20 percent range. If it’s true adoption is this low, I think one factor could be first impressions — my wife got turned off by Apple Pay in the earlier years because so many retail terminals that supposedly accepted it were so finicky. Using an old-fashioned credit card was more reliable. Also, habits. But I use Apple Pay today whenever I can, and I find it more reliable than tap-and-pay with a physical card.
Nick Heer, writing at Pixel Envy:
This survey shows an approximately flat use rate from 2019 through
2021, down slightly from 2018. Webster writes that the pandemic
ought to have “changed the trajectory of Apple Pay” as
“contactless and touchless have become the consumer’s checkout
mantra”. But anyone with a Face ID-equipped iPhone can tell you
that wearing a mask requires you to authenticate by using your
passcode, so it has been far easier for the past eighteen months
to simply tap a card. That is probably true generally, as well;
Apple Pay may have better privacy and security, but it is no
easier to use than a card that supports tap to pay, even without
the added complication of pandemic precautions.
Apple Pay with Apple Watch works well while wearing a face mask, but using your iPhone sucks.

A surprise retirement forced Braun to return and be the old guy on the blue line.
 The moment Matt Niskanen retired, the stop-gap solution was quickly taken, gobbled up like a last piece of ham and stuffed down your hole, and that ham was Justin Braun. The elder veteran of the blue line that was acquired for a couple draft picks from the San Jose Sharks the summer prior, was on an expiring deal and while it might have made sense just to let him walk, with another established right-handed shot parting ways with the NHL, then it kind of fit that they just brought back this dude that they’re already familiar with.
Signing a two-year deal, Braun was given a little bit of a longer commitment than normal for a 34-year-old blueliner, but they must have just…</span>

Let’s talk prospects!
 At long last! The Flyers’ Development Camp made its triumphant return last week, and though not everyone was able to make it, it was still a great chance to check in with a number of prospects for the first time in a little while, and for some, the first time ever. We’ve got lots of notes to get to, so let’s get right into it. 
Five stars
Tyson Foerster
If we’re looking for someone who, while not having come into camp with the most buzz, very quickly asserted himself as one of the biggest standouts, Foerster would be your guy. 
One of the first bits to note is that his skating already looks a bit better. This was something that was talked a lot about after he was drafted as being an issue, and while, after watching him with the Phantoms la…</span>

NHL players are officially returning to the Winter Olympics, and several Flyers players could end up representing their countries in Beijing.
 It’s official. The NHL and NHLPA announced Friday that they have reached an agreement with the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) allowing NHL players to participate in the upcoming Winter Olympics in Beijing after they were unable to compete in Pyeongchang.
This news hardly comes as a surprise as the NHL went so far as to include a two-week Olympic break during its regular-season schedule in order to accommodate their inevitable agreement with the IIHF.
With NHL players returning to the Olympics, this could mean that multiple Flyers players will be headed overseas to represent their countr…</span>

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *Did everyone have a nice day off yesterday? Did you reflect on the importance of organized labor and maintaining a healthy work-life balance? Hopefully. Well with the unofficial end of Summer behind us, we’ve got nothing to do but look forward to the rapidly approaching season. First up will be training camp, and a few young players are going to have to earn a spot if they want one, because right now they’re all filled up. [NBC Sports Philly]
*Speaking of young players, the Flyers took a big bet on Joel Farabee and while we’ll have to wait to see how it pans out, Charlie breaks down all the reasons why it was a good bet to make regardless. [The Athletic]
*We learned the the NHL will definitely officially be sending players to the Olympics this year, and we may see a couple of Flyers, which is fun. [Inquirer]
*Despite the agreement between the IIHF and the league coming to fruition, there’s still work to be done there. [ProHockeyTalk]
*Anyhoo, back to the Flyers. Predictions are starting to happen and some folks seem to think that the Metro might end up being a super tight race for the playoffs. Again. [Pensburgh]
*Despite this big impressive offseason, Chuck Fletcher is still considered a middle-of-the-pack general manager. He may just prove that wrong though! [ProHockeyTalk]
*The Habs didn’t match the Kotkaniemi offer sheet — shocking! — so he’s a Canes now. [Canes Country]
*And finally, a brand spanking new Flyperbole!! Perfect for a fake Monday. [BSH]</span>

Sledgehammer calls Vanguard ‘the most tactical experience you’ve ever had in Call of Duty’
 This year’s Call of Duty will introduce new environmental destruction features in multiplayer, developer Sledgehammer Games said during a reveal stream on Tuesday, which will change the layout and flow of Call of Duty: Vanguard’s maps. Players also have another reason to be wary even while they’re behind cover: One of the game’s multiplayer weapon perks will let players see their opponents through walls in certain situations.
In the video reveal for Call of Duty: Vanguard’s multiplayer, Sledgehammer developers discussed the breadth of competitive modes coming in this year’s game. During one section featuring multiplayer creative director Greg Reisdorf, l…</span>

The new map will run on the same engine as Vanguard
 Raven Software has released the first new details on Call of Duty: Warzone’s upcoming map, which will be set in the Pacific.  The developer revealed the new information, along with a few screenshots, on Tuesday, during Call of Duty: Vanguard’s multiplayer reveal stream.
Like everything related to Vanguard, Warzone’s new map will be World War II-themed. The map is set in the Pacific, on an island with dense foliage and a few small towns and cities for players to fight in. Based on the early footage, it seems like the map will be a lot more tropical than Verdansk, and should feature more fighting in the jungles than the more urban settings of previous maps. 
The new Warzone map will also run on the same engine as Call of Duty: Vanguard — which is essentially the same engine as Modern Warfare and the original version of Warzone’s Verdansk. According to Raven Software, this means that the game will easily integrate with Vanguard, including its weapons and gameplay style, which should be present on the new Pacific theater map when it’s released sometime later this fall. 
The other major Warzone update that Raven Software offered on Tuesday was an update about the game’s new anti-cheat system. Unfortunately, that update didn’t really contain any new or meaningful details. But with Warzone cheating as bad as it’s been recently, it’s nice to hear that Raven is still hard at work on the new system. In a Call of Duty blog post on Tuesday, Raven called the system a “multifaceted new anti-cheat system for PC,” and explained that it’s still testing the system at the moment, but that it should be ready for Warzone’s Pacific map launch.

The skins change as you move and include plenty of music
 Riot has announced the latest line of weapon skins for Valorant, but the developer had some help this time around. For this batch, Riot collaborated with EDM artist Zedd to make a line up of musically infused weapon varieties. 
The skin line will be called Spectrum, and Riot debuted the first look at each of the guns on Tuesday. The bundle includes skins for the Phantom, Guardian, Bulldog and Classic weapons, as well as for the knife melee weapon. Each skin has three variant colors (purple, red, and black) and a few upgrades, which players can unlock with Radianite Points. 
The skins’ base variety is a sleek white with bright LEDs on the side, which change colors as you move, like the lights in a club. Spectrum skins also have unique animations for kills, a variety of unique firing sounds, and their round-finisher upgrade turns the map into a giant dance party. 
This latest skin line isn’t the first time that Riot has collaborated with Zedd either. Back in 2016, the artist did the theme song for that year’s League of Legends World Championship — a track that remains a favorite of League fans today. While Riot has made plenty of exciting skins in the past, Spectrum seems to have some of the most complicated cosmetics the developer has ever made for Valorant. They’re definitely the most in-depth since last year’s Elderflame skins.
The Spectrum skin line is set to arrive in the Valorant in-game store on Wednesday, a day before the game’s new map, Fracture, will be released. The bundle, which includes all the skins, two gun buddies, a player card, and a spray, will cost a whopping 10,700 Valorant Points. For some perspective there, 11,000 Valorant Points costs $99.99.</span>

                    <span>In a video broadcasted to staffers days before Labor Day, Apple&#x27;s retail and people chief Deirdre O&#x27;Brien addressed the growing number of Apple employees voicing their opinions about workplace issues like pay inequality.





For those unaware, over the last few weeks, some Apple employees have taken to Twitter to share their workplace frustrations, sparking the &quot;AppleToo&quot; movement. Created by a group of employees, the &quot;Apple Too&quot; initiative is pushing for Apple to &quot;fulfill its promise of inclusion, diversity, and equity,&quot; as the website states.



In the video, which was seen by MacRumors, Deirdre O&#x27;Brien tells staff who are experiencing workplace issues to talk to their managers and &quot;business relations partner.&quot; She says that Apple has a &quot;confidential process to thoroughly inve…</span>

                    <span>Apple will need to pay more for the chips in its devices and may pass rising costs on to its customers, according to sources speaking to Nikkei Asia.





TSMC, Apple&#x27;s main chip supplier, is in the process of increasing its prices following wider inflation in the industry caused by the global chip supply shortage. The company&#x27;s planned price rises are said to be the most substantial chip price hikes in a decade.



TSMC&#x27;s chips were already around 20 percent more expensive than those from its direct rivals, but smaller foundries have ramped up their own prices due to higher material and logistics costs, and TSMC has committed to $100 billion in new investment over the next three years, motivating the company to increase its prices to maintain its premium and pass these added cos…</span>

                    <span>Smartphone makers like Apple and Google should be required to provide security updates and spare parts for their mobile devices for at least seven years, according to new environmental responsibility proposals from the German government to the European Union (via Heise Online).





The European Commission recently proposed that mobile device manufacturers should provide software updates and spare parts for five years, with tablet spare parts available for six years. It also wants to force manufacturers to publish the prices of the spare parts and ensure they don&#x27;t increase, and deliver said parts in no more than five working days.



However, Germany wants the EU to go further by demanding seven years of updates and spare parts availability. In addition, it wants manufacturers t…</span>

Apple on Friday said it was delaying the planned features to &quot;take additional time over the coming months to collect input and making improvements,&quot; following negative feedback from a wide range of individuals and organizations, including security researches, politicians, policy groups, and even some Apple employees.

                    <span>Drake&#x27;s latest album &quot;Certified Lover Boy&quot; is Apple Music&#x27;s most-streamed album in 24 hours in the services&#x27; history, Apple revealed to Billboard over the weekend.



 

The album was released at midnight EST on Friday, September 3, and is the sixth studio album from the artist. It features a number of prominent rappers, including Jay-Z, Lil Wayne, Future, Rick Ross, and Lil Baby.



&quot;Certified Lover Boy&quot; is a 21-track album and features Apple&#x27;s pregnant woman emojis on its album cover. The cover notes describe the album as &quot;a combination of toxic masculinity and acceptance of truth which is inevitably heartbreaking,&quot; and is executive produced by Drake, Noah “40” Shebib, Oliver El-Khatib and Noel Cadastre. 



The album had already reportedly broke the record for the most-streamed album in 2021 in under 12 hours on the service.



The new record comes just three days after Kanye West&#x27;s &quot;Donda&quot; broke Apple Music&#x27;s day-one streams record for 2021 with 60 million plays in the United States.

                    <span>Taiwan&#x27;s Railways Administration (TRA) has officially announced support for using Apple Pay when purchasing train tickets with the service&#x27;s e-booking mobile app.





In a press release on its website, the country&#x27;s railway operator said it was making the new &quot;‌Apple Pay‌ ticketing service&quot; available from September 7 in order to improve convenience for passengers when booking tickets via the official mobile app.



After passing the initial verification, the payment procedure will be completed via ‌Apple Pay‌, saving users the time it takes to enter their credit card number, said the operator.



Alongside ‌Apple Pay‌ support, the TRA&#x27;s new membership system is launching a reward scheme where passengers can accumulate redeemable points for using the mobile ticket purchasing mechanism. 



Every 50 NT dollar spent is converted into 1 point, and every 2 points points can be redeemed to earn up to a 30% discount on the price of a ticket. Originally, the scheme was only open at the physical ticket windows where points could be used to buy train tickets, but the mobile app now supports the feature, too.

Originally shared online last week by Twitter account @PinkDon1, the video shows a batch of silicone cases in white boxes, held together by elastic bands, with the labels reading &quot;‌iPhone 13‌ Pro Max Silicone Case&quot; along with the MagSafe branding below it. The video then shows a stack of the boxes in clear packaging, suggesting the location is a manufacturing facility or distribution warehouse.

                    <span>Apple is expected to introduce the Apple Watch Series 7 at an event in September, and the Series 7 is an exciting update because it features the first significant redesign to the Apple Watch that we&#x27;ve seen in years.





This guide covers everything we know about the Apple Watch Series 7, ranging from design changes to launch date to production issues.



Design and Display


The Apple Watch has looked largely the same since it was released in 2015, though it did get a display overhaul with the launch of the Apple Watch Series 4. The Apple Watch Series 7 will feature a much more dramatic design change that will make it clearly distinguishable from prior Apple Watch models.





First of all, it will come in new 41mm and 45mm size options, up from 40 and 44mm. The larger …</span>

Apple&#x27;s annual iPhone event is likely just a week or so away and all eyes will be on the company as it unveils the next version of its most popular product line.

                    <span>Apple&#x27;s Safari app has undergone a number of changes during the iOS 15 beta testing process. Apple started out with a radical new design that moved the address bar from the top of the app&#x27;s interface and introduced a floating tab bar, but after a multitude of complaints, there were several redesigns that culminated in an option to undo the ‌iOS 15‌ design entirely.





This guide walks through all of the features added in the ‌iOS 15‌ Safari app, including those new design options.



Design Changes


Safari started out with a new floating tab design that moved the address bar and tabs to the bottom of the iPhone interface, but now the design change is optional.





In the Safari section of the Settings app, you can choose your tab view. The &quot;Tab Bar&quot; option moves the a…</span>

                    <span>A former Chrysler proving grounds for automotive testing outside of Phoenix, Arizona, that has been rumored to be used by Apple was recently purchased for $125 million by the firm that has been leasing it for the past five years, according to AZ Big Media.





Back in 2017, it was reported that a company by the name of Route 14 Investment Partners LLC had signed a lease to use the facility, with rumors suggesting Apple was behind the deal, although there was no definitive proof of the link. Route 14 is represented by the Phoenix office of law firm Greenberg Traurig, hiding the true ownership of the company.



Route 14 has now exercised an option to purchase the property, which consists of 34 separate parcels, for $125 million in cash. The purchase agreement is dated June 25, 2021, with a deed and assumption of an existing development agreement with the City of Surprise both dated July 30 and seen by MacRumors.





We have still not been able to concretely tie Apple to Route 14, but it&#x27;s clear that whoever is behind the firm has deep pockets and a long-term interest in the testing facility.



Rumors about Apple&#x27;s work on both autonomous driving systems and actual electric vehicles have ebbed and flowed over the last several years. The most recent report just this week claimed that Apple has been visiting with Toyota as it seeks to develop a supplier network with an eye toward producing an Apple-branded car starting in 2024.

                    <span>Apple has hired two former Mercedes engineers to join the company, likely as part of its effort to continue to build out its internal workforce as the development of an &quot;Apple Car&quot; continues.





The leading new hire previously worked at Mercedes, focusing on mass production of vehicles, vehicle steering, dynamics, and software and project management. The hire, now working as a product design engineer at Apple at its &quot;Special Projects Group,&quot; also previously worked at Porsche, undertaking similar responsibilities. A second engineer who previously worked at Mercedes has also recently been tapped by Apple to join the company, MacRumors has learned.

                    <span>Apple has delayed the rollout of the Child Safety Features that it announced last month following negative feedback, the company has today announced.





The planned features include scanning users&#x27; iCloud Photos libraries for Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM), Communication Safety to warn children and their parents when receiving or sending sexually explicit photos, and expanded CSAM guidance in Siri and Search.



Apple confirmed that feedback from customers, non-profit and advocacy groups, researchers, and others about the plans has prompted the delay to give the company time to make improvements. Apple issued the following statement about its decision:

                    <span>YouTube says it has passed 50 million subscribers for its Premium and Music subscriptions, making it the &quot;fastest growing music subscription&quot; service in the world, according to YouTube&#x27;s global head of music, Lyor Cohen. 





YouTube says that it has more than 50 million paying subscribers collectively across YouTube Premium and YouTube Music. The Google-owned service says it attributes this milestone to several factors, but mainly due to how subscribers can get &quot;uninterrupted access to the largest and most diverse catalogue of music, artists and culture&quot; through its subscriptions.

We&#x27;ve got killer products in YouTube Music and YouTube Premium that deliver truly unique value to artists and creators and the best experience for music fans and video lovers. We&#x27;re in our own lane -- there&#x27;s no other place where fans can get uninterrupted access to the largest and most diverse catalogue of music, artists and culture. We&#x27;re making it easy for music fans to go deep and find their thing -- whether that&#x27;s on YouTube or the YouTube Music app. 
YouTube Music comes as part of a YouTube Premium subscription but can also be purchased standalone. With YouTube Premium, customers can download videos for offline viewing, play videos in the background playback, no ads, and more. 



YouTube Music is one of many competitors to Apple Music, and it&#x27;s hard to name a winner purely based on subscriber count. Apple doesn&#x27;t provide specific subscriber figures, but the latest estimate was 60 million subscribers in 2019. Three years on, the number is likely higher. Additionally, Apple One, which bundles ‌Apple Music‌ with other Apple&#x27;s services, makes it harder to determine how many ‌Apple Music‌ subscribers are out there.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/03/apple-alternative-arm-architecture/">

                    <span>Apple may be exploring the possibility of using an open-source alternative to the Arm architecture, which it&#x27;s been using in its products for decades.





According to a newly posted job alert, spotted by Tom&#x27;s Hardware, Apple is looking for an engineer that specializes in RISC-V, an open-source architecture instruction set that allows device makers to build their own chips without having to pay a license or royalty. Apple currently uses the Arm architecture in its products, and it pays the company a royalty fee to use its instruction set. 



Apple&#x27;s job posting description states that the engineer will implement &quot;innovative RISC-V solutions and state of the art routines&quot; to Apple&#x27;s products. Specifically, Apple hopes prospective engineers will be able to work with the RISC-V instruction set, as well as have an understanding of Arm. 



Tom&#x27;s Hardware theorizes that if Apple were to adopt the open-source instruction set of RISC-V, it may save the company money because it wouldn&#x27;t need to pay Arm a license fee for its instruction set.

Every Arm core requires Apple to pay a licensing fee to Arm, and since the number of cores for things like SSD controllers and smartwatches will only increase, so will Apple&#x27;s payments to Arm. As such, replacing at least some Arm cores with RISC-V cores could save Apple millions of dollars in royalty payments every year...
The job listing is a confirmation that Apple is exploring the use of RISC-V, but whether the company decides to implement the open-source technology remains to be seen. Apple&#x27;s reliance on Arm has increased in the past year as Apple is in the process of switching its Mac lineup to Arm-based processors rather than Intel.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/03/twitter-plans-new-privacy-features-hide-tweets/">

                    <span>Twitter is planning new privacy-related features that provide users with greater control over follower lists and who can see their posts and likes, reports Bloomberg.





The plans are said to include an option to archive old tweets so that other users can&#x27;t see them after a set period of time designated by the account holder (such as 30, 60, or 90 days, or a whole year), as well as the ability to edit follower lists.



According to Bloomberg, the plans are an effort to make people more comfortable interacting and sharing on Twitter, and are related to what Twitter executives call &quot;social privacy,&quot; or how users manage their identities and reputations on the social network. 



Internal research at the company reportedly found that many Twitter users don&#x27;t understand the privacy basics, like whether their account is private or public, which causes them to engage less on the social network because they don&#x27;t know what other people will be able to see about them.



To counter this, Twitter will start prompting users to review whether their accounts are public or private beginning in September. Its privacy team are also working on other potential changes including the ability to remove followers (as opposed to blocking them), hide liked tweets, and remove oneself from a public conversation. 



Twitter has no timeline for some of the changes, while some features, like the archive option, are still in the &quot;concept phase,&quot; but Twitter plans to let people remove followers starting this month, and to let users remove themselves from conversations by the end of the year.

                    <span>Here’s a perfect example of what I was talking about in the previous item, about The Wirecutter institutionally fetishizing price over quality. And within “quality” I include design aesthetics, which, let’s face it, almost always goes hand-in-hand with price.
From their current list of “best” drip coffee makers, which is topped by OXO’s $200 Brew 9-Cup:
You can find a number of expensive, stylish coffee makers made in
small quantities for enthusiast audiences. Clive Coffee’s Ratio
Eight and the Chemex Ottomatic are two prominent
examples. They’re all made for connoisseurs who are willing to
spend a lot on a high-end machine. The main draw of these coffee
makers is that they brew similarly to manually making a batch of
pour-over — pre-infusing the grounds and evenly pouring the hot
water. F…</span>

                    <span>The New York Times:
The New York Times Company announced today that Wirecutter, its
product recommendation service, will institute a metered paywall,
asking its frequent users to subscribe for unlimited access to its
research and recommendations. New York Times All Access digital
and home delivery subscribers will continue to receive unlimited
access to Wirecutter’s 1,200+ product reviews, deals coverage and
other guides to help them shop confidently online with their
existing subscription. A standalone subscription to Wirecutter is
available for $5 every four weeks or $40 annually.
This makes sense, and in my opinion, the Times’s paywall rules are among the best in the industry, in terms of offering a generous number of free reads to non-subscribers. But it’s one less “free for everyone to read” high-quality site.
(I have always enjoyed Wirecutter, going back to when they debuted (and had a leading The), but I wish they had a rival that focused less on price. Wirecutter recommendations are very often skewed to the best low-priced product, not the best product in a category, period. I want domain experts to tell me the best products — I can make up my own mind on how much I want to spend.)

                    <span>Jane Manchun Wong:
Each Super Follow is an In-App Purchase on the App Store, but
because there are too many IAPs for the Twitter app, the App Store
only shows 10 instead of the full list.
Her tweet includes this screenshot. The gist is, each Twitter user offering Super Follows gets its own distinct IAP. If there are 1,000 users offering Super Follows, there are 1,000 discrete IAPs in the App Store. If there are 10,000 users offering them, 10,000 IAPs. If there are 100,000, our heads explode.
This is incredible. Ostensibly, Twitter is doing what Apple wants them to do. Right now Super Follows payments are even exclusive to iOS. (Once you pay on iOS, you can see Super Follow content on Twitter’s Android and web clients, too, but the only way to pay is on iOS through IAP.) But Apple’s IAP system is so brittle that Twitter has to make a discrete SKU for each and every Super Follow user, and pay Apple 30 percent of the price for the privilege. (Twitter, per its published terms, takes just 3 percent of the first $50,000 in lifetime earnings, then 20 percent after that.) Also, because Apple’s IAP listings in the App Store rank IAP offerings by popularity, Twitter is being forced to reveal data that they quite likely would prefer to keep to themselves.

                    <span>Reed Albergotti, reporting for The Washington Post on Apple’s postponement of the new child safety features for iMessage and iCloud Photos:
Apple spokesman Fred Sainz said he would not provide a statement
on Friday’s announcement because The Washington Post would not
agree to use it without naming the spokesperson.
Fair enough, I suppose, but Albergotti’s blinders have become rather obvious.

                    <span>Apple, in a statement to the media this morning:
Last month we announced plans for features intended to help
protect children from predators who use communication tools to
recruit and exploit them, and limit the spread of Child Sexual
Abuse Material. Based on feedback from customers, advocacy groups,
researchers and others, we have decided to take additional time
over the coming months to collect input and make improvements
before releasing these critically important child safety features.
Accepting feedback and considering that feedback is exactly why they announced these two initiatives in advance, with details, rather than just launching them. Neither of these initiatives should be rushed.

The call was for a vehicle in floodwaters on Route 518 in Hopewell
Township — one of many rescue calls in New Jersey Wednesday
evening as storms from Hurricane Ida flooded the state. Police
Officer James Hoffman went to check it out.
Moments after arriving in the area, east of Route 31 at about 8:30
p.m., Hoffman turned into a victim.
His patrol car started taking on water, then started floating away — sliding sideways about 100 yards into deeper water. Hoffman
ditched his bulky duty vest, climbed through a window and started
swimming. He found a tree and held on.
Amazing story.

                    <span>Stanford Medicine:
A large, randomized trial led by researchers at Stanford Medicine
and Yale University has found that wearing a surgical face mask
over the mouth and nose is an effective way to reduce the
occurrence of COVID-19 in community settings.
It also showed that relatively low-cost, targeted interventions to
promote mask-wearing can significantly increase the use of face
coverings in rural, low-income countries. Based on the results,
the interventional model is being scaled up to reach tens of
millions of people in Southeast Asia and Latin America over the
next few months.
You might be tempted to file this under “Duh”, but it’s essential to actually study things like this rigorously. It was just 18 months ago, at the outset of the pandemic, when the CDC and other health organizations were saying people shouldn’t bother with face masks.

                    <span>John Siracusa, on Twitter:
Sure, your “reader” app can include one (1) approved link to your
website … but will you be allowed to have any text near that link
explaining why someone might want to tap on it, or is that still
forbidden? This is where we are, mentally, when considering App
Store rules in 2021.
I have a friend who works at a company with a somewhat popular “reader” app that everyone has heard of, who says that internally, there’s a contingent that suspects Apple is going to require these apps to also offer Apple’s IAP to be allowed to include a link to their website.
That’s how much trust Apple has burned.
The spirit of Apple’s settlement with the Japan Fair Trade Commission is clear: these “reader” apps are going to be permitted to link users to their websites for signing up and buying media like e-books, movies, and music. Within that spirit, of course they’re going to be allowed to have text explaining this, and of course they’re not going to be required to also offer Apple’s IAP for these same purchases.
But very reasonable, smart people are genuinely skeptical that Apple is going to adhere to the spirit of this settlement.
Call me a fool, but I think Apple is going to follow through and do the right thing by these apps. There are a lot of negative adjectives that I’d apply to Apple regarding the App Store. Greedy, inconsistent, frustrating, shortsighted, capricious, technically illiterate. Did I say greedy? But one thing Apple is not and never has been is devious. Apple does not play tricks. And the JFTC would not take kindly to tricks.

In which, this time, the Flyers sign the contract *during* the show. 
 As the gang reviews the Sean Couturier contract after a week to let it settle in, the Flyers gave an extension to Joel Farabee and gave the show a whole new focus. Once that was out of the way the gang dove into the Flyers’ announcement that they’d be adding someone to the team’s Hall of Fame. Picks were made.</span>

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *In what was kind of a surprising bit of news on a late Thursday morning, the Flyers announced that they signed Joel Farabee to the AMac special, locking him up for his prime years. [BSH]
*Like we said it’s a pretty long term contract, so the Flyers are taking a gamble. Calculated, though. [NBC Sports Philly]
*Speaking of impressive youngster, Elliott Desnoyers out of Halifax had a heck of a camp. [Inquirer]
*Speaking of things we are less-than-impressed by, Travis Konecny had a bad year last year. No two ways about it. He’s going to need to be better to move this team forward. [BSH]
*And finally, put a bow on development camp AND get a great subscription deal by reading Charlie’s full analysis of what was what in the way only Charlie can. [The Athletic]</span>

Joe Blackburn and Justin Truman talk Trace Rifles, Gjallarhorn, and Exotic Catalysts
 A little more than a week after the Destiny Showcase, we know a lot more about The Witch Queen expansion and Year 5 of Destiny 2 than we did before. And in talking to game director Joe Blackburn and general manager Justin Truman last week, we’ve gotten new information on weapon crafting and glaives, raids, Hive Guardians, and the subclass reworks. But to round out our series of interviews, it’s time to talk about the lifeblood of Destiny: weapons. 
We spoke to the developer duo about if unique, Exotic-only weapons will stay Exotic forever, the limitations of Exotic Catalysts, and the return of Gjallarhorn.
Legendary trace rifles could be on the horizon

                    <span>In a recent episode of Apple TV+ series &quot;Ted Lasso,&quot; Jeremy Swift&#x27;s character Higgins briefly poked fun at actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney purchasing Welsh soccer club Wrexham AFC last year.





That led Reynolds and McElhenney to respond on Twitter with a humorous letter teasing legal action unless Apple sent over two large boxes of Ted Lasso biscuits.



Wrexham AFC today confirmed that Apple has followed through, sending 50 boxes of the famous Ted Lasso biscuits to players.




A man of his word, thanks @TedLasso! 
Better late than never, 50 boxes of forgiveness are gratefully accepted 🍪

In the TV series, titular character Ted Lasso won over AFC Richmond owner Rebecca Welton by giving her shortbread biscuits every day, which he baked himself.



The second season of &quot;Ted Lasso&quot; is currently streaming on ‌Apple TV+‌. Six episodes have aired so far, with a new episode coming each Friday.

                    <span>Apple has secured the global rights to &quot;The Fight Before Christmas&quot; documentary, which will premiere on Apple TV+ on Friday, November 26, reports Deadline.





The documentary tells the story of lawyer Jeremy Morris, who is obsessed with Christmas and planned the biggest community Christmas event in America. His Christmas plans hit a snag when the home owner&#x27;s association tells him his planned event violates neighborhood rules.



This leads to a man vs. HOA fight over the festivities, and the dispute snowballs out of control.
Produced by Dorothy Street Pictures, the doc follows the story of a North Idaho neighborhood turned upside down by one man&#x27;s obsession with bringing Christmas cheer to all, through the biggest community Christmas event America has ever seen. Christmas-loving lawyer Jeremy Morris&#x27; plan hits a snag when the home owners&#x27; association informs him that the event violates the rules of the neighborhood. A contentious fight over the festivities erupts and things snowball out of control. As the situation escalates, the film asks the question, who wins when different rights and interests collide? Director Read pieces together the polarized perspectives in this quirky Christmas tale about freedoms, with a message about differences and tolerance at its heart.
The film is directed by Becky Read, who produced &quot;Three Identical Strangers,&quot; a documentary about triplets who were separated at birth and adopted by different families.

                    <span>Apple is developing several new watch face options that will take advantage of the larger screen size of the upcoming Apple Watch Series 7 models, reports Bloomberg.





The Apple Watch Series 7 models will come in 41mm and 45mm body sizes, up from the current 40mm and 44mm sizes. For the 45mm model, the screen will measure in at 1.9 inches diagonally, up from 1.78 inches, and it will have a resolution of 396 x 484, up from 368 x 448, which equates to 16 percent more pixels. 



Bloomberg has not provided similar details for the 41mm model, but it too will see a comparable increase in body size, and both models will have slimmed down display borders.

                    <span>Apple will not be able to avoid a proposed class action lawsuit covering Siri privacy claims, reports Reuters. The suit in question, which was initially filed in 2019, accuses Apple&#x27;s voice assistant ‌Siri‌ of violating user privacy.





The plaintiffs involved in the case can try to prove that ‌Siri‌ routinely recorded private conversations due to accidental activations, and that Apple disclosed those conversations to third parties such as advertisers, said the judge.



One user in the lawsuit claimed that his private discussions with his doctor about a &quot;brand name surgical treatment&quot; caused him to receive targeted ads for that treatment, while others said that their discussions about Air Jordan sneakers, Pit Viper sunglasses, and Olive Garden resulted in targeted ads.

                    <span>The iPad mini has been largely the same since it was first introduced in 2012. It&#x27;s had the same thick bezels and Home button across all five of its refreshes, but that&#x27;s set to change with the debut of the ‌iPad mini‌ 6.





Design


The ‌iPad mini‌ 6 will nix the Home button and adopt a design that&#x27;s similar to the iPad Air with a larger edge-to-edge display with slimmed down bezels that measures in at somewhere around 8.3 to 9 inches.



With no Home button, the ‌iPad mini‌ 6 is expected to get the same Touch ID power button as the ‌iPad Air‌, but it&#x27;s not yet clear whether it will get a USB-C port or continue to use Lightning. It could also include a Smart Connector for use with accessories like the Magic Keyboard.

                    <span>&quot;Dickinson&quot; was one of the first TV shows to be available on the Apple TV+ streaming service when it launched in November 2019, and it is set to wrap up with the third season, Apple announced today.





Season two of &quot;Dickinson&quot; premiered earlier this year, and season three is set to premiere on Friday, November 5. In the third season, Emily Dickinson (played by Hailee Steinfeld) sees her productivity fall amid the American Civil War and a battle that divides her own family. She tries to heal the divide around her, wondering if art can keep hope alive and if the future can be better than the past.



&quot;Dickinson&quot; stars Toby Huss, Adrian Blake Enscoe, Anna Baryshnikov, Ella Hunt, Amanda Warren, Chinaza Uche, and Jane Krakowski will return, as will Wiz Khalifa, who plays Death. Guest stars will include Billy Eichner, Chloe Fineman, Zosia Mamet, Will Pullen, and more.



The first three episodes will come out on November 5, with the remaining seven following on a Friday release schedule.

Following the announcement, some developers have said Apple&#x27;s decision is not good enough.



For starters, some have criticized Apple&#x27;s plan to let developers share only &quot;a single link&quot; to their website to help users set up and manage their account. Apple is still considering the types of wording it will let developers use for these links, according to…</span>

                    <span>With Apple&#x27;s third-generation AirPods believed to be arriving alongside the iPhone 13, which is just a few weeks away, we have compiled all of the coherent rumors from our news coverage to build a full picture of the features and upgrades coming to the company&#x27;s next-generation wireless earbuds.



AirPods 3 clones in a clear case, reportedly showing the next-generation design.



It is worth noting that the rumors below are aggregated from our coverage from a wide range of sources, including leakers, analysts, and publications. The reliability of each source varies, so some of the rumored features may be taken with a pinch of salt.



Nevertheless, the overall view of the third-generation ‌AirPods‌ rumors gives a good idea of many of the upcoming upgrades and what users can la…</span>

                    <span>A normal-looking Lightning cable that can used to steal data like passwords and send it to a hacker has been developed, Vice reports.



The &quot;OMG Cable&quot; compared to Apple&#x27;s Lightning to USB cable.


The &quot;OMG Cable&quot; works exactly like a normal Lightning to USB cable and can log keystrokes from connected Mac keyboards, iPads, and iPhones, and then send this data to a bad actor who could be over a mile away. They work by creating a Wi-Fi hotspot that a hacker can connect to, and using a simple web app they can record keystrokes.



The cables also include geofencing features that allow users to trigger or block the device&#x27;s payloads based on its location, preventing the leakage of payloads or keystrokes from other devices being collected. Other features include the ability to change keyboard mappings and the ability to forge the identity of USB devices.








The cables contain a small implanted chip and are physically the same size as authentic cables, making it extremely difficult to identify a malicious cable. The implant itself apparently takes up around half of the length of a USB-C connector&#x27;s plastic shell, allowing the cable to continue to operate as normal.



An x-ray view of the implanted chip inside the USB-C end of an OMG Cable.




The cables, made as part of a series of penetration testing tools by the security researcher known as &quot;MG,&quot; have now entered mass production to be sold by the cybersecurity vendor Hak5. The cables are available in a number of versions, including Lightning to USB-C, and can visually mimic cables from a range of accessory manufacturers, making them a noteworthy threat to device security.

                    <span>Following a report earlier this week from Nikkei Asia that claimed volume production of upcoming Apple Watch Series 7 models had been delayed due to manufacturing challenges, a new report has offered a more specific timeframe.





According to a paywalled preview of a DigiTimes report, suppliers are scheduled to ramp up Apple Watch Series 7 production starting at the end of September. That timeframe could indeed reflect a short delay in production, as Nikkei Asia had reported that Apple Watch Series 7 mass production was originally slated to begin around mid-September.



It&#x27;s unclear if any production delay would affect launch timing of the Apple Watch Series 7. Apple has unveiled new Apple Watch models in September for five consecutive years, dating back to the Apple Watch Ser…</span>

                    <span>A long-time alternative to Apple&#x27;s Files app has been Documents, developed by Readdle. Today, the company is launching &quot;Documents X,&quot; intending to speed up everyday productivity tasks and offer users a refreshed design.





At the heart of Documents X is a feature Readdle is calling &quot;Smart Actions.&quot; Smart Actions are contextual actions that are recommended to users depending on an action they just took. For example, if a user uploads a file to Dropbox or Google Drive, the app may suggest that the user shares the link. If a user downloads a music video, they may get presented with a Smart Action to extract the audio from the video.





The number of Smart Actions is rather extensive and is built directly into the app without launching external apps or services to perform them. Readdle says all the actions are &quot;performed locally, which means that your files and activities don’t leave the device.&quot;





Documents X is also built on an updated design philosophy Readdle is calling &quot;FOCUS.&quot; FOCUS aims to reduce complexity for the in-app experience while maintaining a high level of attention to detail and simplicity. The new design includes updated colors, icons, menus, controls, and more that have been &quot;thoughtfully designed.&quot; 



Documents X can be downloaded from the App Store for free [Direct Link].

                    <span>Each Twitter Super Follow subscription is an individual in-app purchase for every account with the feature set up, it has emerged.



Screenshot from Jane Manchun Wong showing Twitter&#x27;s in-app purchases on its App Store page.


The unusual system, spotted by Jane Manchun Wong, means that for every Super Follow there is an individual in-app purchase for that account specifically. Some observers are speculating that each Super Follow in-app purchase will have to be set up manually by Twitter on the ‌App Store‌, making the system even more unconventional.



The ‌App Store‌ does not allow for multiple instances of the same subscription, leading other platforms such as YouTube and Twitch to get around this by effectively allowing users to buy a sub-token that can be directed toward a specific creator.



This means that there will be thousands of Twitter in-app purchases, dwarfing Twitter&#x27;s own Twitter Blue subscription and Ticketed Spaces, Twitter&#x27;s ‌App Store‌ page will only show 10 in-app purchases since it would be impractical to show the entire list.



Apple only allows developers to create up to 10,000 in-app purchases, so it is not clear if Twitter will limit the users eligible to sell Super Follows at 10,000 minus Ticketed Spaces and Twitter Blue.



Twitter announced Super Follows earlier this year, allowing creators with at least 10,000 Followers to charge up to $9.99 per month as a subscription for access to exclusive tweets. Twitter takes a three percent cut of Super Follow subscriptions up to a total of $50,000, making Apple&#x27;s 30 percent in-app purchase fee markedly larger.



The feature finally launched yesterday, starting in the United States and Canada, but it will be rolling out globally on iOS in the next few weeks.

                    <span>Apple is rumored to be in Asia visiting Toyota as it prepares to lay the supplier groundwork to mass produce a branded car by 2024, according to a new report by DigiTimes.





Apple representatives were said to have met with South Korea&#x27;s SK Group and LG Electronics last month to discuss Apple Car development, and now Japan&#x27;s Toyota is being touted as its next potential destination. 



Apple has been working on a car-related project since at least 2014, and at one stage it looked as if the company was scaling back to focus on autonomous vehicle software. However, following several changes in management and hiring, Apple is now believed to be focused on building a car for consumers.



But to do that, the company needs to tap into a whole new supply chain. Apple is expected to rely on a manufacturing partner to build the vehicles, and though it wants to make EV batteries in the United States, it may be seeking partnerships with established vehicle makers like Toyota to do so.



Reuters has previously reported that Apple is developing a new battery design that has the potential to &quot;radically&quot; reduce the cost of batteries and increase the vehicle&#x27;s range.



One person who spoke to Reuters described Apple&#x27;s &quot;monocle&quot; battery technology as &quot;next level&quot; and said that it&#x27;s similar to &quot;the first time you saw the iPhone.&quot;



Reuters&#x27; reporting claimed that Apple is aiming to begin production on an Apple-branded self-driving vehicle starting in 2024, so DigiTimes&#x27; focus on that date isn&#x27;t necessarily a shot in the dark. However, delays caused by the ongoing global health crisis or current chip shortage could always push production to 2025 or beyond.

                    <span>Eve today released an update to its latest version of the Eve Thermo that adds Thread support to the HomeKit-enabled smart radiator valve (via HomeKitNews).





The update fulfills a pledge the German company made late last year to bring Thread support to several products, and follows its inclusion in devices like the Eve Energy Smart plug (fourth generation), Eve Aqua (second generation), Eve Weather, and Eve Door &amp; Window (third generation).



As a quick explainer, Thread is a low latency and low power mesh-like network for smart devices. Unlike Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, the Thread standard doesn&#x27;t depend on a router or hub. Instead, the smart device itself extends the network by talking to other Thread-enabled devices, thereby boosting the signal between them.



Apple&#x27;s HomePod mini and the latest Apple TV 4K act as Thread border routers, and by adding Thread-supported devices around the home, users can typically expect improved connectivity compared to Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, a wider control range, and more remote scheduling options.



In related news, version 5.3 of the Eve app adds support for its upcoming HomeKit-enabled MothionBlinds, which are expected to launch sometime this year.

                    <span>Apple hopes to circumvent Samsung in the supply of components for a &quot;folded&quot; telephoto lens for 2023 iPhones, according to unnamed sources cited by Korean website The Elec.





The report claims Apple has approached Jahwa Electronics, which is part of Samsung&#x27;s supply chain, to supply an optical image stabilization module for the camera. Jahwa co-developed the technology with Samsung, which could cause Apple patent problems down the line. However, Apple likely has its own workaround for the patents or will end up paying a licensing fee to Samsung, according to the report.

                    <span>Apple could be facing a widespread investigation into the App Store in India, and more specifically, the company&#x27;s in-app purchasing system, which grants it a 15% to 30% commission for all purchases made, reports Reuters.





The Competition Commission of India (CCI), which oversees cases of possible anti-competitive and antitrust behavior, is reviewing an antitrust challenge case against Apple presented by a non-profit Indian group. The group claims, in their case, that Apple&#x27;s standard 30% commission for in-app purchases &quot;hurts competition&quot; since it raises costs for both the developer and the customer.

                    <span>Spotify has announced a new partnership with Delta that will see the streaming service take over the &quot;audio&quot; section of Delta&#x27;s in-flight seatback entertainment, making select playlists and podcasts freely available to all passengers.




You are now free to roam about the cabin—and get the music and podcasts you love at 30,000 feet. Beginning today, we&#x27;re taking off in a new partnership with Delta in which Spotify will take over the &quot;audio&quot; section of Delta&#x27;s in-flight seatback entertainment. This means passengers on Delta flights that are equipped with seatback entertainment globally can now enjoy their favorite audio content exclusively in-flight on Delta Studio. 
According to the press release, the free in-flight content is licensed directly by Delta and will include specially curated versions of Spotify&#x27;s most popular playlists, along with 42 select podcast series to choose from. 



In other words, not all Spotify content will be available, but passengers will be able to listen to playlists such as such as Mood Booster, Are &amp; Be, Hot Country, mint, Today&#x27;s Top Hits, Relax &amp; Unwind, RapCaviar, and Ultimate Indie. 



The first podcasts available will include Crime Junkie, Science Vs, StartUp, The Dave Chang Show, The Hottest Take, The Journal, and more.



Spotify says the update to Delta&#x27;s in-flight entertainment is rolling out now, with more content being updated regularly and more coming in October.

                    <span>So what would happen if Max Headroom smoked a kilo of meth then decided to produce a Nitro Breakcore track? The end result might sound like the new BIG LAD track “Self Care is Cancelled.” This band’s new album Power Tools is totally bonkers and will kill your brain cells with each listen. The visual […]

                    <span>It’s been well documented that the Catholic Church is rife with sexual predators. So many sexual predators that you’d think one of the ten commandments is “rape children.” The other night I watched a documentary called Nuns Sexually Abused These Women For Years and I can’t believe people still attend church after decades of abuse […]

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/japan-fair-trade-commission-closes-app-store-investigation/">

                    <span>This is actually big news from Apple:
Apple today announced an update coming to the App Store that
closes an investigation by the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC).
The update will allow developers of “reader” apps to include an
in-app link to their website for users to set up or manage an
account. While the agreement was made with the JFTC, Apple will
apply this change globally to all reader apps on the store. Reader
apps provide previously purchased content or content subscriptions
for digital magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, and video.
To ensure a safe and seamless user experience, the App Store’s
guidelines require developers to sell digital services and
subscriptions using Apple’s in-app payment system. Because
developers of reader apps do not offer in-app digital goods and
services for purchase, Apple agreed with the JFTC to let
developers of these apps share a single link to their website to
help users set up and manage their account. […]
“Trust on the App Store is everything to us. The focus of the App
Store is always to create a safe and secure experience for users,
while helping them find and use great apps on the devices they
love,” said Phil Schiller, Apple Fellow who oversees the App
Store. “We have great respect for the Japan Fair Trade Commission
and appreciate the work we’ve done together, which will help
developers of reader apps make it easier for users to set up and
manage their apps and services, while protecting their privacy and
maintaining their trust.”
Progress. Apple’s anti-steering provisions are the number one thing I have been clamoring to be changed in the App Store rules. I think this should expand beyond just “reader” apps, but one step at a time.
Do you hear that sound? That’s the sound of a significant amount of antitrust pressure being relieved from Apple.

                    <span>I released Acorn 7.1 yesterday, which has some new features, changes, and bug fixes. There&#x27;s nothing earth shattering in here, just another release that continually improves Acorn. The full release notes are available as always.
There is one little, yet devilish, bug fix in the 7.1 release. It took a while to track down and the fix of course was super easy.
Soon after the release of MacOS 11.5 I started getting crash reports. Lots of crash reports. They all had similar stack traces, pointing to something in the guts of Apple&#x27;s Key Value Observing code (_NSKeyValueObservationInfoGetObservances specifically).
But the messages from my customers in the crash reports all pointed to wildly different things. Someone was using flood fill, and got a crash. Someone else was changing the size of the …</span>

                    <span>Allen Pike: The Persistent Gravity of Cross Platform
In practice, the tradeoff is about more than “cheap vs. good”. Unintuitively, sometimes native tech can actually be the cheapest way to achieve a certain goal, and sometimes cross-platform technologies actually lead to better products, even for very well-funded companies. So what is a useful way to think about the tradeoff?
Over the last decade I’ve talked to people at hundreds of companies about how they’re developing and supporting apps, helping them evaluate and plan native and cross-platform app work. While there are a lot of factors that go into this technology decision, there’s one that I think is particularly illuminating.
More and more apps written with web tech (such as Electron) are showing up on the Mac desktop everyday. I understand why, but I don&#x27;t have to like it.</span>

 The Philadelphia Flyers just won’t stop making moves. I think Chuck Fletcher just likes being in the spotlight.
Announced by the team on Thursday, they have signed one of their most premium young players in Joel Farabee to a six-year, $30-million ($5-million AAV) extension. The 21-year-old still has one year remaining on his rookie contract, making this deal keep him in Philadelphia through the 2027-28 season.

Since being selected by the Flyers at 14th overall in the 2018 NHL Draft, Farabee has surprised all by how quickly he was able to adapt at the top level and has quickly become …</span>

But, he improved in other areas of his game.
 If one was expecting Travis Konecny to carry the momentum from the start of his 2020-21 season throughout the year, then you were sadly let down.
We can be forgiven for the optimism given Konecny’s habit to hit the ground running in NHL seasons, and with expectations on the Flyers high last year, it was appearing as if we could have a point-per-game TK on our hands. 


However, Konecny’s 2020-21 was streaky, and after his promising start, he went through large stretches of games with zero points. At times he disappeared and was barely noticeable on the ice, from a personal eye-test perspective.




Despite his streakiness, and penchant to go missing from games, 34 points in 50 games doesn’t c…</span>

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *That’s another Development Camp in the books, and now all we have to do is wait a couple of weeks for the big boys to hit the ice. The big finale was the 3-on-3 tournament, in which a couple of guys you expected to look good looked good. Which is good! [Flyers]
*The star of the show on day three was definitely front office newcomer Mike O’Connell, who has some really insightful things to say about the players he worked with. [BSH]
*Isaac Ratcliffe got the last word on the player blog’s front. Kid’s working hard. [Flyers]
*Ratcliffe has been a bit of a letdown since joining the Phantoms, but he’s hoping all that aforementioned hard work is going to get him back to the performance level we all expected when he was drafted. [Inquirer]
*The big winger owes a lot to the Flyers organization. Like, A LOT. And as a result, he really wants to succeed here. [NBC Sports Philly]
*With camp behind us and focus turning to the big boys, let’s talk about some young guys poised for a breakout this season. [BSH]
*Wednesday night Team Canada finally beat the US women at Worlds in an overtime thriller. Here’s how they finally did it. [The Athletic]
*And finally, it’s 25 Under 25 time! We’re going to roll through the 25 best players as quickly as we can before training camp starts, and we need you to tell us who those best 25 are. So get to voting. [BSH]</span>

Turn-based tactical gameplay for months
 A collection of Final Fantasy games are on the way to PlayStation Now, which allow players to stream the titles on their PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, or PC. The first game will be Final Fantasy 7 — the original version, which is still worth a spin, not the recent remake. Final Fantasy 7 will arrive on PlayStation Now on Sept. 7, and it’ll be followed by one new Final Fantasy game a month until some of the series’ best games are available to play.
The second game will be Final Fantasy 8 Remastered on Oct. 5, which is a turn-based tale of sweeping romance and worldwide war. Squall, Rinoa, and the rest of the SeeD gang are part of one of the most underrated Final Fantasies, and it’s nice to see more players having access to that tale. 
This is followed by Final Fantasy 9 on Nov. 2, which is still fondly remembered thanks to characters like Vivi, Garnet, and Zidane. In December, players get a two-fer with Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2 HD Remaster. Finally, on Jan. 4, 2022, Final Fantasy 12: The Zodiac Age will release on PlayStation Now, which is great because it has Balthier and Fran, who are some of the best party members in the entire franchise.</span>

Destiny 2 will also see a remaster of another original Destiny raid
 In addition to revealing that Destiny 2 players will get a new raid or dungeon every three months starting this December, Bungie recently announced that the legacy raid rotation will return. During its Destiny Showcase last week, the studio talked about the importance of that aspirational, pinnacle content for players. Convincing Destiny’s hardcore players to get together each week is a major priority, according to game director Joe Blackburn and general manager Justin Truman. Those incentives will take the form of the legacy raid rotation and yet another remastered raid from the original Destiny.

 The next season for Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and Call of Duty: Warzone begins Tuesday, Sept. 7. Season 5 “Reloaded” brings all-new content to Call of Duty multiplayer and Zombies mode, including an event called The Numbers — which harkens back to a classic Black Ops narrative theme — and an appearance from comic book supercop Judge Dredd. 
Also, your bullets can look like beer, because Oktoberfest is coming to Call of Duty.

Meet Vex, the cutest lil goth
 League of Legends has tons of cute champions, including the fuzzy fae race known as Yordles. The next champion is Vex, the Gloomist, and she turns that trend on its head. This is one sad, emo little Yordle, and she’s got a big shadow friend to help her control the battlefield. Vex looks like a powerful mage who’s able to set up her abilities from range.
Riot hasn’t revealed the exact explanation and numbers behind her ability kit, but we see her use her shadow for getting around the map a little faster and setting up an initiation as the enemy team goes to kill the dragon.


We knew Vex was on the way, thanks to her presence in the Sentinels of Light lore event. Vex helped out the Ruined King, Viego, and it looks like she still has a little bit of a crush on the gloomy wife guy. She also wants to hang out with Amumu, the sad mummy with no friends, so she’s not all bad. Her debut skin also looks much more colorful, for players who find the dark color palette to be unappealing.</span>

I can have a little cosmic dread, as a treat
 A recent Dead Space panel came with a revelation: protagonist Isaac Clarke, who was speechless in the original game, would now be voice acted for the remake. It’s a relatively small change in the grand scheme of things, but it’s a point of contention for many fans. A voice protagonist is a tricky tool to use in horror, and some games use a little too much of it. 



Sometimes it works out OK, like Leon S. Kennedy in Resident Evil 4, who is fondly remembered for his great zingers like “Your right hand comes off?” But in The Medium, a recent horror title from Bloober Team, I could hardly hear myself think over protagonist Marianne’s musings.

                    <span>Two of Apple&#x27;s self-driving cars operating in manual mode were involved in minor collisions in August, according to the California DMV.





The first incident [PDF] occurred in San Diego, California in the Hillcrest area on August 19. The Lexus RX 450h was stopped in traffic and was hit by a Hyundai. The accident was described as minor with no injuries.



The second accident [PDF] occurred on August 23 in Cupertino, California, right near the Apple Park campus. The vehicle with Apple&#x27;s self-driving equipment was in manual mode and it was stopped in traffic when it was rear ended by a Subaru Outback.



Both of these incidents were not the fault of the self-driving vehicle or the person operating the vehicle, and are largely not notable. What is interesting, though, is that Apple vehicles were involved in two collisions in the same month after no accidents since September 2019.



Earlier this year, the California DMV&#x27;s disengagement and mileage reports suggested that Apple&#x27;s Lexus SUVs with self-driving software traversed more than 18,000 miles in 2020, a steep increase compared to prior years. It&#x27;s possible that Apple has ramped up its testing in 2021, leading to a higher number of incidents.



Apple has been testing its self-driving software since early 2017, using the aforementioned Lexus RX 450h vehicles outfitted with sensors and cameras. The work on autonomous driving is part of Apple&#x27;s longtime car project, and rumors suggest Apple is planning to release a vehicle in the mid to late 2020s.

                    <span>Twitter today announced the official launch of Super Follows, a new feature that allows creators to provide subscriber-only content that requires a paid fee to access.





First introduced in February, Super Follow is another method that Twitter is using to monetize tweets and provide content creators with a way to earn money on the platform.



Creators who use the Super Follow feature on Twitter can charge $2.99, $4.99, or $9.99 per month to allow their subscribers to access exclusive tweet content. According to Twitter, creators are eligible to keep up to 97 percent of revenue until a $50,000 threshold is reached, and after that, creators will earn up to 80 percent of revenue after in-app purchase fees.



Twitter says that Super Follows are designed for anyone that brings &quot;unique perspectives and personalities&quot; to Twitter to drive public conversation.



At the current time, Super Follows are available to a small group of U.S. content creators that applied to participate, but people can apply to join the waitlist to set up a Super Follows subscription. 10,000 or more Twitter follows are required.



Those interested in subscribing to an account that offers Super Follows can tap on the Super Follow button on an account&#x27;s profile to see pricing details. Super Follow is limited to the U.S. and Canada at the current time, but it will be rolling out globally on iOS in the next few weeks.

                    <span>Apple today released a new update for Safari Technology Preview, the experimental browser Apple first introduced in March 2016. Apple designed the ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ to test features that may be introduced into future release versions of Safari.





‌Safari Technology Preview‌ release 131 includes bug fixes and performance improvements for Web Inspector, CSS, Web API, JavaScript, Platform Features, Media, Web Audio, WebRTC, Payment Request, WebCrypto, Accessibility, and Rendering.

Employees have been asked to voluntarily share whether they have been vaccinated by mid-September, and this applies to both employees working in an office and those working remotely. In a memo, Apple said that its focus is keeping &quot;team members, their friends and families, and our entire community healthy,&quot; but also mentioned creating a safe work environment.

                    <span>Twitter today announced that it is testing a new feature called Safety Mode, which is designed to cut down on harassment and unwelcome interactions on the social network.





Users who often get unwanted, spammy, or abusive replies to their tweets can turn on Safety Mode, which will autoblock accounts that use harmful language like insults, or send repetitive, uninvited replies and mentions.



Twitter says that Safety Mode assesses the likelihood of a negative engagement by considering the Tweet&#x27;s content and the relationship between the Tweet author and replier. People blocked by Safety Mode will be unable to follow your account, see your Tweets, or send Direct Messages.

— Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) September 1, 2021
 


With Safety Mode, the autoblock stays on for a minimum of seven days, and autoblocked accounts are listed in the Safety Mode interface. Accounts that a person follows will not be autoblocked.



To develop Safety Mode, Twitter consulted trusted partners with expertise in online safety, mental health, and human rights.
We want you to enjoy healthy conversations, so this test is one way we&#x27;re limiting overwhelming and unwelcome interactions that can interrupt those conversations. Our goal is to better protect the individual on the receiving end of Tweets by reducing the prevalence and visibility of harmful remarks.
Twitter is testing Safety Mode with a small group of people at the current time and will expand the testing group as feedback is received. During the beta testing period, Twitter says it will incorporate improvements and adjustments before releasing the feature for all users.

                    <span>After unveiling its latest Pixel 6 smartphones with a custom Arm-based Google Tensor chip last month, Google is also developing its own Arm-based processors for future Chromebook laptops and tablets, according to Nikkei Asia. 





Google plans to roll out its own processors for Chromebooks in around 2023, according to the report. Chromebooks are laptops, tablets, and detachable devices that run Google&#x27;s Chrome OS operating system, and they are available from brands such as Google, Samsung, Lenovo, Dell, HP, Acer, and ASUS in several markets.



The report claims that Google was particularly inspired by Apple&#x27;s success in developing its own chips for not only iPhones, but also Macs following the introduction of the Apple-designed M1 chip last year. The first Macs with Apple silicon chips were released in November 2020 and Apple previously said the transition away from Intel-based processors for its Mac lineup would take about two years to be completed.



The latest Mac to transition to Apple silicon is the base model iMac, which was updated with the M1 chip, a colorful new design, and a larger 24-inch display in April. Apple is also rumored to be planning redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with a faster version of the M1 chip for release later this year, with multiple reports having stated the notebooks are likely to be released in October or November.

                    <span>Apple is planning to add a raft of new health features to the Apple Watch, including blood-pressure trends, a thermometer for fertility and sleep tracking, sleep apnea detection, and diabetes detection, as well as a number of updates for existing models, according to the Wall Street Journal.





Sources who claim to be familiar with Apple&#x27;s plans and have access to internal company documents told the Wall Street Journal about the company&#x27;s development of a large number of new Apple Watch health features in detail. Most of these new health monitoring functions are not expected to arrive before 2022.

                    <span>Telegram Messenger has received a major update that expands support for live video streams, allowing streams to be watched by an unlimited number of viewers.





Version 8 of the popular messaging platform uncaps the previous live stream audience limit of 1,000 viewers for groups and channels, and includes more customization options when forwarding messages, plus a shortcut to switch between channels.



The change makes the previous update that brought group video calls all the more powerful for live broadcasts. &quot;The power to run your own TV station is here, right in your pocket,&quot; says Telegram in a blog post, underlining the possibilities.



When forwarding messages, there&#x27;s a new option to remove captions, and sender names can now be hidden. Meanwhile, at the bottom of a text channel, there&#x27;s a new option to quickly swipe up and jump to the next unread channel.



This update also makes stickers easier to find, with trending stickers now shown above the &quot;Recently Used&quot; sticker panel, and there&#x27;s now an unread messages counter in comment threads.



Telegram is a free download for iPhone and iPad from the App Store. [Direct Link]

                    <span>Apple has returned to in-person Today at Apple sessions in its retail stores in Europe, including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Turkey, and Brussels, offering local communities a chance to gather once again to learn, collaborate, and explore the world of Apple&#x27;s devices and services.





Apple, due to the global health crisis, halted in-person Today at Apple sessions last year. The company was originally hoping to return to normalcy in its stores in the United States on August 30; however, concerns regarding the health and safety of staff and customers pushed the company to delay the return to in-person Today at Apple sessions. 



In replacement of in-person sessions, Apple has been producing and publishing Today at Apple sessions for YouTube, ranging from photography to drawing and art. Apple customers in Europe can now reserve and participate in Today at Apple sessions by checking the website for date, time, and availability for their local store. 



Apple says that it will ask all participants, including kids, to wear a mask, adhere to social distancing, and additional health and safety measures based on local conditions.

                    <span>On Tuesday, Nikkei Asia published a report claiming the upcoming Apple Watch Series 7 will feature blood pressure measurement capabilities, and that this is one of the reasons why production of the device has hit snags as manufacturers adjust to the more complex design. 





Later the same day, Bloomberg cited its own sources corroborating Nikkei&#x27;s main claim that the new model had brought manufacturing challenges which could lead to supply constraints or shipment delays, but the subsequent report by Debbie Wu and Mark Gurman made no mention of Nikkei&#x27;s claim about a blood pressure sensor being one of the causes of the production snags.



However, if there was any doubt, Gurman has now put to bed Nikkei&#x27;s key assertion in a tweet, saying that there&#x27;s &quot;no chance&quot; the Apple Watch…</span>

If true, that would beat the iPhone 12&#x27;s maximum 15W wireless charging speed (or 12W on ‌iPhone 12 mini‌) using Apple&#x27;s MagSafe charger, and would be another one-up for the Pixel 6 phones, which are already shaping up to be a respectable rival to the upcoming iPhone 13 expected to launch this month. 



With a ‌‌MagSafe‌‌ charger and Apple&#x27;s 20W power adapter or another appropriate 20W+ PD 3.0 charger, it takes about an hour to charge an ‌‌iPhone 12‌‌ from zero to 50 percent, which is double the time that it takes to charge using a…</span>

The Philips Hue system will use an algorithm to analyze the metadata of each song in real time to make Hue lights flash, dim, brighten, and change colors while matching with the beat, mood, genre, and tempo of music on Spotify. The algorithm even takes into account factors like loudness, segments, pitch, and more.



With the Sync tab in the Philips Hue app, users can personalize the Spotify integration experience. There are tools for starting and stopping the sync, changing the brightness and intensity of the lights, and choosing a palette to change the colors of the lights.

                    <span>Al Jazeera:
The new rules will only allow gaming platforms to offer services
to minors from 8pm to 9pm on Fridays, weekends and public
holidays, according to state news agency Xinhua, which cited a
release by the National Press and Publication Administration.
China had previously restricted gaming hours for teens to 1.5
hours per day in 2019.
It’s “indisputable” that indulging in online games affects normal
study life and the physical and mental health of teens, the
People’s Daily article said. “Destroying a teenager will destroy a
family.”
Young Chinese gamers were, however, angry.
“This group of grandfathers and uncles who make these rules and
regulations, have you ever played games? Do you understand that
the best age for e-sports players is in their teens?” said one
comment on China’s Twitter-like Weibo.
“Sexual consent at 14, at 16 you can go out to work but you have
to be 18 to play games. This is really a joke.”
I’m not predicting anything, but, this could severely backfire against the CCP. You can only push people so far before they revolt, and it’s hard to imagine how the CCP could breed more resentment than by taking away video games from teens.

Folks ... it is back.
 The last time we did an update to our periodical, often-twice-a-year-but-sometimes-less Philadelphia Flyers Top 25 Under 25 series here at BSH, it was in March of 2020, when the NHL had just hit pause on its regular season due to COVID and we thought hockey was going to be back pretty soon and things would be normal before we knew it. And that’s exactly what happened!
(/does the thing where you put your finger to your ear to pretend you’re getting an important update on an earpiece)
Ah. I’m hearing that that’s not actually what happened. I hate it here.
Anywho! It’s been so long since we last did this that the Flyers have brought on not one, but two draft classes since then. Nine of the players in the Top 25 the l…</span>

Another development camp check-in. 
 We’re still rolling through development camp, and the yesterday saw the players pretty much wrapping up the drills focused portion of camp, before we move into the 3-on-3 tournament this afternoon. After the day’s sessions, we caught up with one of the organization’s newcomers in Mike O’Connell (Senior Advisor to the General Manager/Player Development), as well as a couple of players in Samuel Ersson, Isaac Ratcliffe, and Mason Millman. They were a chatty bunch, so we’ll avoid going on for a million years here and just run through the highlight reel.

On Isaac Ratcliffe, and if anyone in particular has surprised him at camp.

The youth movement has been somewhat halted — but there’s still plenty of breakout potential in this group of youngsters. 
 After scoring just eight goals in 52 games during his rookie season, Joel Farabee exploded with a 20-goal, 38-point campaign in 2020-21 — which begs the question of which Flyer is poised to backup Farabee’s breakout with one of their own in 2021-22.
Given that Flyers GM Chuck Fletcher was aggressive in moving out younger players that traditionally fall into the breakout mold ala Farabee in favor of better veterans to improve the team in the short-term, there are significantly less options to choose from during this exercise.
That said, the Flyers still have some intriguing young talent in the pipeline that are certainly ski…</span>

                    <span>First look at gameplay from Firaxis’ Marvel strategy game
 Marvel’s Midnight Suns is the next turn-based game from the team behind XCOM. Lead designer Jake Solomon was on hand today during a Twitch livestream hosted by IGN to detail the game’s card-based combat system.
The combat was the biggest reveal from the stream, which included a six-minute sequence of heavily edited gameplay. It showed a hand of cards positioned along the bottom of the user interface, right about where XCOM’s ability hotkeys lived in the past. The video went on to detail how those abilities are gained, upgraded, and combined with other heroes’ moves.

 NBA 2K22’s audio presentation will feature all 30 of the NBA’s real-life arena public-address announcers — these are the folks who fire up the crowd with spotlight introductions of the starting lineup, ceremonies that have become as memorable as the superstars themselves.
Visual Concepts and 2K Sports announced the feature on Wednesday, naming mic men Matt Cord of the Philadelphia 76ers and Mike Walczewski of the New York Knicks among the 30 lending their voices to the game. 
“After last year, I think we all have a renewed appreciation for the noise and cheers that fill an NBA arena each night,” Walczewski said in a statement. “With the style and enthusiasm of every team’s PA announcer now in the game, I truly feel that…</span>

Hive Guardians are powerful new enemies in Destiny 2, and they’ll take some new strategies to kill
 For all of Bungie’s impressive tricks shown in the reveal of Destiny 2: The Witch Queen, the addition of Hive Guardians is likely the biggest. While monumental from a story perspective, Hive Guardians will also shape each fight in which they’re present. Like the Guardians that players control, Hive Guardians can use Supers, and they can resurrect — they can fight like us.
In an interview with Destiny 2 game director Joe Blackburn and general manager Justin Truman, we spoke about the challenges that Hive Guardians bring to the field.
“We want it to feel like you’re fighting you,” said Blackburn. “We want it to feel like you’re fighting something that you understand. Th…</span>

Attack and defense are a little different on Fracture
 Valorant’s new map is its most unique so far. Fracture, which was officially announced on Wednesday, reverses attackers and defenders and makes both sides play a little differently than they’re used to. 
Fracture is shaped like a giant letter “H.” There are two bombsites on the map with the connecting section of the “H” in-between. While you might expect the middle section to be the attacker’s spawn, it’s actually the other way around. On Fracture, defenders start in the middle, leaving the spawn area to defend the sites on either side. Meanwhile, the attackers can pinch in toward the defenders from either side. To help make transitioning from one area of the map to another a little easier, there are also ziplines that run from one side to the other that run below the map.

This represents a pretty massive change to the regular format for Valorant maps, which generally place defenders in positions that encourage more passive play, allowing attackers to push into them. However, on this map, the spawns mean that defenders are often put in the position to make the first move. 


Fracture also includes more lore than any previous Valorant map. The map features two mirror versions of reality, which is essentially the set up for the game’s larger story — and its explanation for why two versions of the same Agent might face off in a match. While we don’t know much about the world beyond its mirrored concept, there are interactable clues spread out around Fracture that should shed some new light on Valorant’s two realities. 
Image: Riot Games
  
Fracture is set to come to Valorant as part of the patch 3.05 update, which players should expect to arrive next week as part of the game’s new Act update. Valorant Episode 3 Act 2 is scheduled to drop around Sept. 9.

It’s a placeholder file, and mainly an Xbox Game Pass promotion
 If you’re an Xbox Game Pass subscriber, it looks like you can preinstall* Halo Infinite, a game launching a good three months from now.
(*You’ll be preinstalling what appears to be a 280.2 MB placeholder file, not a full build ready to play in the first minute of launch day or anything.)
Nonetheless, Halo fans and Xbox Game Pass subscribers took Microsoft up on the offer this morning, which right now isn’t much more than a preorder call to action. Halo Infinite launches Dec. 8 on Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X, and the preload offer verifies that it’ll be available the same day for Game Pass members, the same as Microsoft-published Forza Horizon 5, which also has a preloading option. The racing game launches Nov. 9.
Originally expected with the arrival of the Xbox Series X last year, Halo Infinite’s launch date was finally revealed a week ago at Gamescom. The game will arrive with a free-to-play multiplayer mode and a single-player campaign, but cooperative campaign multiplayer will have to wait for a post-release update. 
343 Industries’ Gamescom presentation made no mention of Halo Infinite’s campaign, which some fans found worrying. Infinite’s creative director followed up with a post the next day saying that the campaign is finished and feature complete, and that the developers are just busy finding and wiping out bugs and getting the game ready for release.</span>

Microsoft announces its first Xbox and PC games of September
 Xbox Game Pass subscribers will get a new slate of games in the first half of September, starting with Final Fantasy 13, the post-apocalyptic roguelike Nuclear Throne, and the absolutely ridiculous Surgeon Simulator 2. 
Along with those three, Microsoft is adding Craftopia, Breathedge, Signs of the Sojourner, Crown Trick, and The Artful Escape. Each of these games is coming to both console and PC, making this a packed couple of weeks for all of the service’s subscribers. 
Here’s what Xbox Game Pass subscribers should expect in the next few weeks: 
Craftopia (Cloud, Console, and PC) — Sept. 2
Final Fantasy 13 (Console and PC) — Sept. 2
Signs of the Sojourner (Cloud, Console, and PC) — Sept. 2
Surgeon Simulator 2 (Cloud, Console, and PC) — Sept. 2
Crown Trick (Console and PC) — Sept. 7
Breathedge (Cloud, Console, and PC) — Sept. 9
Nuclear Throne (Console and PC) — Sept. 9
The Artful Escape (Console and PC) — Sept. 9
On top of that, there are also three Quake titles, Quake, Quake 2, and Quake 3 Arena, which came to the service in late August. August also saw the additions of Myst, Twelve Minutes, Hades, Skate 3, and several other games to Xbox Game Pass, which are still available. 
Of course, there are also a few games leaving the service in September:
Leaving Sept. 13

Red Dead Online (Cloud and Console) 

Leaving Sept. 15
Company of Heroes 2 (PC)
Disgaea 4 (PC)
Forza Motorsport 7 (Cloud, Console, and PC)

Settlements and more arrive in 3.6 patch for No Man’s Sky
 Developer Hello Games gives No Man’s Sky players another free update with Frontiers, which introduces planetary settlements to the massive procedurally generated space exploration game. Hello Games likens the new settlements to the spaceport city of Mos Eisley from Star Wars, where intergalactic travelers can gather and grow their community.
No Man’s Sky’s new settlements, available Wednesday in patch 3.6, are tiny towns with NPC inhabitants, some of whom have their own problems. Players can help these settlements grow and even oversee them; Overseers can construct new buildings, solve citizens’ problems, make decisions, resolve disagreements, and provide security against threats.

                    <span>Apple today seeded a new public beta of the macOS 12 Monterey beta to public beta testers, allowing non-developers to test the new macOS Monterey software ahead of its public release. The updated beta comes just a day after Apple released the sixth macOS Monterey developer beta.





Public beta testers can download the macOS 12 Monterey update from the Software Update section of the System Preferences app after installing the proper profile from Apple&#x27;s beta software website.



‌macOS Monterey‌ introduces quite a few major updates for the macOS operating system. Universal Control, for example, lets a single mouse, trackpad, and keyboard be used across multiple Mac or iPad devices, and it&#x27;s now possible to AirPlay directly to a Mac from an iPhone, ‌iPad‌, or even another Mac.

                    <span>Twitter&#x27;s latest beta update introduces support for providing content creators with Bitcoin tips using the &quot;Tip Jar&quot; feature that Twitter introduced earlier this year. Bitcoin isn&#x27;t yet available to select as a tip option for beta users, but code in the beta suggests that Twitter is in the process of rolling it out.





When the Tip Jar was first introduced, Twitter allowed users to add Bandcamp, Cash App, Patreon, PayPal and Venmo links to their Twitter profile, but soon, there will be a Bitcoin option. The addition of a Bitcoin tipping option comes after Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey told investors in July that Bitcoin was important to the company and would be coming to the Tip Jar in the future.



Details in the latest Twitter beta indicate that users will be directed through a Bitcoin tutorial that includes details on the Bitcoin Lightning Network and custodial and non-custodial Bitcoin wallets.



Twitter gives Strike, Blue Wallet and Wallet of Satoshi as examples of custodial wallets and Muun, Breez, Phoenix and Zap as examples of non-custodial wallets. Twitter also informs users that a Strike account is required. &quot;We use Strike to generate Bitcoin Lightning invoices so you&#x27;ll need to connect your account to accept Bitcoin tips&quot; reads the text.



Twitter also appears to be working on &quot;Cheer,&quot; &quot;Haha,&quot; &quot;Hmm,&quot; &quot;Like,&quot; and &quot;Sad&quot; reactions to tweets that users will be able to activate using a press and hold gesture on the current like button.





Bitcoin support for tips is limited to the Twitter beta at this time and is not yet available for all beta users, so it is not yet clear when the Bitcoin feature will see an official release. There&#x27;s also no word just yet on when the new reactions will launch.

                    <span>Apple today released a revised version of the AirTags firmware that was first provided to ‌AirTags‌ owners last week. The new internal build number is 1A291c, up from 1A291a.





We don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s included in the new firmware and no new features were found following the first release, so it likely focuses on bug fixes and other under-the-hood improvements.



There is no way to force an AirTag update, as it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s done over-the-air through a connected iPhone. To make sure the update happens, you can put your AirTag in range of your ‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌, but you have to wait for the firmware to roll out to your device.



You can check your current AirTag firmware version using the Find My app, with instructions available in our how to.

                    <span>The popular endless hopper Crossy Road from Hipster Whale is coming soon to Apple Arcade. A release date has not been announced at this time, but users can sign up to be notified when the game becomes available through the App Store.





Similar to Frogger, Crossy Road tasks players with crossing a road bustling with traffic and obstacles, and there are many adorable characters to choose from, ranging from a chicken to a penguin. As with all games available through the service, the Apple Arcade version of Crossy Road will not have any ads or in-app purchases available.



Crossy Road was among the first games announced for the fourth-generation Apple TV alongside the introduction of the tvOS App Store back in September 2015. However, it appears the Apple Arcade edition of the game will be limited to the iPhone and iPad.



A variation of the game titled Crossy Road Castle, an endless runner/platformer combo, launched on Apple Arcade in February 2020.



Three additional games are set to launch on Apple Arcade this Friday, including Zen Pinball Party, MasterChef: Let&#x27;s Cook, and Layton&#x27;s Mystery Journey.



Priced at $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year, Apple Arcade provides access to a catalog of over 200 games without ads or in-app purchases across the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV, with additional titles added periodically.

Developers can download the new tvOS 15 beta by downloading a profile onto the ‌Apple TV‌ using Xcode.



Apple shared little about tvOS 15 when it was unveiled, but there are some new features that are coming to the operating system.

                    <span>Nomad today announced the launch of the Base Station Mini with Magnetic Alignment, a small single-device charger designed for Apple&#x27;s iPhone 12 models.





The Base Station Mini with Magnetic Alignment features the same design as the original Base Station Mini, but it also includes integrated magnets that allow it to align more easily with MagSafe devices. This is not an official ‌MagSafe‌ accessory because ‌MagSafe‌ charging components need to be supplied from Apple and Apple has been slow getting the hardware to third-party companies.



As it is not using ‌MagSafe‌, the new Base Station Mini will charge an ‌iPhone 12‌ (and earlier iPhones) at a maximum of 7.5W, but it is a 15W charger so it can charge Qi-enabled Android smartphones more quickly. It is also compatible with AirPods and other Qi-based devices.



A USB-C cable comes along with it for charging purposes, and there&#x27;s a built-in light sensor that dims at night so it&#x27;s ideal for use on a night stand.



The Base Station Mini with Magnetic Alignment is available from the Nomad website for $69.95.

                    <span>Ahead of the theatrical release of James Bond film &quot;No Time To Die&quot; on October 8 in the United States, a 45-minute retrospective titled &quot;Being James Bond&quot; will be available to watch for free through the Apple TV app, according to Deadline.






The story from MGM is said to feature Daniel Craig reflecting on his 15 years playing Bond, with never-before-seen archival footage from his conversations with producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli. The retrospective will be available for free through the Apple TV app in over 30 regions from September 7 through October 7. 



Amazon in May announced it reached an agreement with MGM to acquire the entertainment company for $8.45 billion, following a report last year that claimed MGM had reached out to companies like Apple and Netflix to gauge interest in a potential acquisition. Amazon said it would help preserve MGM&#x27;s heritage and catalog of films, and provide customers with greater access to MGM&#x27;s existing works, such as the James Bond franchise.

                    <span>Three years after Apple released walkie-talkie functionality for the Apple Watch, Samsung has released a similar app for the Galaxy Watch 4 and Galaxy Watch 4 Classic. 





Samsung released the app via the Google Play Store, which was first spotted by XDA Developers. Similar to Apple&#x27;s own Apple Watch app, Samsung says its walkie-talkie app allows users to &quot;have instant conversations, just like if they were using a walkie-talkie.&quot; While the Apple Watch only allows two people to join in on a conversation, Samsung&#x27;s iteration allows for &quot;two or more users.&quot;



Samsung only lists the Galaxy Watch 4 and Galaxy Watch 4 Classic as compatible with the new app. Screenshots of the app on the Play Store reveal a similar interface to Apple&#x27;s walkie-talkie, featuring a large button to tap and hold to talk.

Development camp rolls on!
 Development camp is still rolling, and after the second day of on-ice activities, you guessed it, we had more player (and staff!) media availabilities. 
First up, we check in with Cara Morey, who’s the coach of the women’s team at Princeton and also serving as a guest coach for this camp, and then we hear from Tyson Foerster, Tanner Laczynski, and Linus Sandin. 
Cara Morey
On how the opportunity to join the staff for this camp arose. 
During the COVID year when our season was canceled, I spoke a little bit with Brent Flahr and had come into a couple meetings on analytics just to stay involved while our season was on hold. Then as development camp was approaching, they had asked if I’d like to come out and be a guest coach. That…</span>

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *Another day of Dev Camp is in the books and Meltzer got a rundown for you. [Flyers]
*Apparently #48 Danny
*Cam York of course is one of the main guys we’re all watching as the camp stuff goes on, and despite the new-look defense making his spot a little less of a sure thing, he’s pretty confident he’s going to get a spot. [Inquirer]
*Cam was one of the guys that spoke with the media the other day; we have the highlights for you. [BSH]
*Charlie sat down and had a good talk with the newest member of the Flyers’ coaching staff. [The Athletic]
*Hmm... Alain Vigneault on the hot seat? Hadn’t considered that. [ProHockeyTalk]
*This weekend’s offer sheet remains the thing most of the hockey world is talking about. And while it may seem like the Canes just did it for spite, it makes sense for them hockey-wise, too. [Sportsnet]
*And what, if anything, will the rest of the league’s GMs learn from this offer sheet? [The Athletic]
*And finally... get your orange tutus and big shaggy wigs ready; the Gritty 5K is back! Fun for a good cause, you can’t go wrong. [Flyers]</span>

Keyboard-and-mouse players grumble that their movement is nerfed across the board
 Apex Legends’ developers will patch out “tap strafing,” a form of player movement used mainly by PC gamers that allows them to make sharp turns to evade or counterattack less mobile opponents. Respawn Entertainment on Tuesday tweeted that the method would be eliminated with the next patch.
After much consideration and debate, we&#x27;ve decided to remove tap-strafing from @playapex in patch 10.1.
Our reasoning: It&#x27;s inaccessible, lacks readability/counterplay, and is exacerbated by movement abilities.
The next patch notes will include a…</span>

Crafting won’t be familiar, but Glaives will have that classic Bungie feel
 Weapon crafting will finally enter the Destiny universe in Destiny 2: The Witch Queen on Feb. 22, 2022. Bungie hasn’t revealed a great deal of information about this system just yet, but we spoke to Destiny 2 game director Joe Blackburn and general manager Justin Truman about how weapon crafting works, what it brings to Destiny, and the benefits of the crafting-only weapon: the glaive.
At last week’s Destiny Showcase, Bungie representatives referred to the crafting system as being “combat based,” but never gave a further explanation. In the original Destiny, weapons would drop for players with locked perks, and players would defeat enemies and spend resources to unlock a weapon’s full potent…</span>

The mode is set to launch on Oct. 12
 Hearthstone’s next game mode is Mercenaries, a turn-based RPG starring a tiny squad of Warcraft characters (and at least one non-Warcraft character). Players have a collection of Mercenary characters that they can pit against competing teams in both PvP and PvE modes. Blizzard will release Mercenaries on Oct. 12. 
Players will start with eight Mercenary characters and the main hub, a Village. The Village lets players manage their characters and base, then send their squad off on a procedurally generated Bounty run or a competitive match against another person. At launch, there will be over 50 Mercenaries, including the Lich King, Sylvanas, and Diablo (from the Diablo games, obviously). Completing the Mercenaries prologue also grants players a mouse mount in World of Warcraft.
There are three kinds of Mercenaries: Fighter, Caster, and Protector, which exist in a rock-paper-scissors system. Once players figure out their squad of three characters, they head into combat, which is turn-based. Each side picks their team’s actions, and then the round plays out. The format feels similar to Hearthstone’s Battlegrounds mode, with rounds split between decision making and action.
Hearthstone publisher Activision Blizzard faces wide-ranging allegations that it maintains a toxic workplace environment that is particularly hostile to women, pays them less, and subjects them to sexual harassment, and that perpetrators are not meaningfully punished, according to a lawsuit filed by California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing in July. You can read more about the allegations against Activision Blizzard in Polygon’s explainer. The lawsuit has caused many Warcraft fans to turn away from the franchise, with some using their remaining World of Warcraft game time to stage an in-game protest.</span>

 The 10 college football programs that have participated in Madden NFL’s last two Face of the Franchise career narratives will cross over with Madden NFL 22’s Superstar KO mode, beginning Tuesday and running until Sept. 27.
The crossover means this is the first game where players can take a college football team into an online match against a friend since the dear departed NCAA Football 14 eight years ago.

Online gala returns for a second year on Oct. 16
 DC Fandome, DC Entertainment’s streaming fan event, returns on Oct. 16. In the announced schedule, Warner Bros. Pictures promises a new trailer for The Batman, along with glimpses of other 2022 releases like Black Adam, The Flash, and Aquaman 2 (aka Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom). Along with the DC movies, the lineup promises new looks at upcoming comics, games, and animated projects.


Scheduled to make a second bow at DC Fandome are Gotham Knights, the Bat Family ensemble action game coming in 2022 from WB Games Montréal, and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, by Rocksteady Studios, makers of the highly acclaimed Batman: Arkham series of games.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/30/china-kids-online-video-game-ban/">

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(8 min)</span>
                    <span>China is implementing a new online gaming restriction that will affect children and teenagers who are under 18 years old, reports CNBC. Kids will only be able to play online games for an hour a day (8:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m.) on weekends and legal holidays. Weekday gaming is prohibited.





Companies that provide online game services to minors will need to comply with these rules and will not be able to offer the games to children outside of those hours. Gaming providers will also be required to have users register with their real names and users will need to be logged in to play. Gaming companies are responsible for ensuring minors are not accessing games outside of the permitted time.



The new rules are meant to safeguard children&#x27;s physical and mental health, and the National Press and Public Administration said that the guidelines address &quot;the problem of minors&#x27; excessive use&quot; of online gaming. China previously had a restriction that limited gameplay to 1.5 hours per day, but gaming was allowed on most days.



Tencent, a major gaming provider in China, said that only a small amount of its gaming revenue comes from younger players. The company plans to implement the new requirements, and earlier today, expressed support for the rules.



It&#x27;s not clear how these new rules will affect games that operate using the App Store. Apple Arcade is not a factor as it is not offered in China, but there are ‌App Store‌ games that require an online connection.



China in 2016 began requiring mobile gaming developers to officially license their games with the government, and in 2020, pressured Apple to remove ‌App Store‌ games from developers that did not comply. Apple has since pulled tens of thousands of games from the ‌App Store‌ in China.

The feature would also allow ‌iPhone‌ users to report crashes and other emergencies in areas where there is no cellular coverage.





There are at least two emergency features that will rely on satellite networks, and while satellite technology has been in the works for years, these capabilities are not likely to launch in 2021.



The first feature, Emergency Message via Satellite, is designed to let users text emergency services and contacts using a satellite network when there is no signal available, and it will be integrated into the Messages app as a third communications protocol alongside SMS and iMessage.

                    <span>Apple today seeded the sixth developer beta of macOS Monterey, the newest version of the macOS operating system. The sixth beta comes three weeks after Apple released the fifth macOS Monterey beta.





Registered developers can download the beta through the Apple Developer Center and once the appropriate profile is installed, betas will be available through the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences.



As with all new betas, Apple recommends not installing the new macOS update on a primary machine because it is early release software and could have bugs.



‌macOS Monterey‌ introduces Universal Control, a feature that lets a single mouse, trackpad, and keyboard be used across multiple Mac or iPad devices, plus there&#x27;s a new AirPlay to Mac feature.

                    <span>Over the weekend, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo sent out a research note suggesting that the iPhone 13 was &quot;likely&quot; to support low earth orbit satellite communication, a feature that would allow iPhone users to make calls and send messages when cellular and WiFi connections are unavailable.





In this note, Kuo said that Apple would use a &quot;customized&quot; Qualcomm X60 baseband chip that supports satellite communications. He also claimed that Apple would work with Qualcomm partner Globalstar on the basis that Qualcomm is implementing support for Globalstar&#x27;s n53 band in a future modem.



Almost immediately, mobile analysts and those with other expertise in mobile devices and communications began disputing Kuo&#x27;s report as inaccurate.

                    <span>Apple has inked a deal for &quot;Raymond and Ray,&quot; an upcoming movie that&#x27;s set to star Ewan McGregor and Ethan Hawke.





The film is about two half brothers who have lived together in the shadow of their father, but still have a sense of humor. After their father dies, they have a chance to reinvent themselves.
&quot;Raymond and Ray&quot; follows half-brothers Raymond (played by Ewan McGregor) and Ray (played by Ethan Hawke) who have lived in the shadow of a terrible father. Somehow, they still each have a sense of humor, and his funeral is a chance for them to reinvent themselves. There&#x27;s anger, there&#x27;s pain, there&#x27;s folly, there might be love, and there&#x27;s definitely grave-digging.
Alfonso Cuarón is set to produce, while Rodrigo García will direct. García is known for &quot;In Treatment,&quot; &quot;Albert Nobbs,&quot; and &quot;Blue.&quot;



&quot;Raymond and Ray&quot; will join other Apple films that include &quot;CODA,&quot; &quot;Emancipation,&quot; &quot;Killers of the Flower Moon,&quot; &quot;Sharper,&quot; &quot;The Tragedy of Macbeth,&quot; &quot;Finch,&quot; and others.

                    <span>Instagram today said that it is now requiring all Instagram users to share their date of birth to &quot;create safer, more private experiences for young people.&quot;





Instagram users who have not already provided their birthday to Instagram will be prompted to share it. Instagram plans to ask for date of birth when the app is opened up, and will provide notifications asking for the information a handful of times.



Users will be required to share their birthdays to continue using the Instagram app. Instagram also plans to place warning screens on certain posts and will ask for a birthday before allowing the content to be viewed. This is the same interface that&#x27;s already in place for sensitive or graphic posts, but it will also now require a date of birth confirmation.



The age information will be used to create new safety features, and it will help ensure that the &quot;right experiences&quot; are provided to the &quot;right age group.&quot; Back in March, Instagram introduced changes to prevent adults from sending messages to users who are under 18, and last month, began defaulting new accounts for users 16 and under to private.



Instagram is developing &quot;new systems&quot; to address people inputting the incorrect date of birth, using AI to estimate how old people are. Going forward, if someone selects an age and Instagram&#x27;s technology disagrees, the app will offer a menu of options for age verification.

                    <span>Apple today announced that it has acquired classical music streaming service Primephonic, and will be folding it into Apple Music.





Primephonic offers an &quot;outstanding listening experience&quot; with search and browse functionality optimized for classical audio, plus handpicked recommendations and &quot;contextual details on repertoire and recordings.&quot;
&quot;We love and have a deep respect for classical music, and Primephonic has become a fan favorite for classical enthusiasts,&quot; said Oliver Schusser, Apple&#x27;s vice president of Apple Music and Beats. &quot;Together, we&#x27;re bringing great new classical features to Apple Music, and in the near future, we&#x27;ll deliver a dedicated classical experience that will truly be the best in the world.&quot;
Apple says that with the Primephonic purchase, ‌Apple Music‌ subscribers will be provided with an improved classical music experience. This will start with Primephonic playlists and audio content, and in the coming months, Apple will offer a dedicated Primephonic experience with improved browsing and search capabilities by composer and repertoire, better classical music metadata, and more.



Primephonic will be taken offline on September 7, and is no longer available for new subscribers. Next year, Apple says it will launch a dedicated classical music app that combines Primephonic&#x27;s classical user interface with added features.



Current Primephonic subscribers will receive six months of ‌Apple Music‌ access for free with access to hundreds of thousands of classical albums that support Lossless and Spatial Audio.

                    <span>Hyper today announced the launch of a set of HyperDrive USB-C hubs that are designed for Apple&#x27;s 24-inch M1 iMacs, and the hubs are unique because they come with faceplates available in each iMac color.





The HyperDrive 5-in-1 Hub features two 5Gb/s USB-C data ports, two 5Gb/s USB-A data ports, and one 5Gb/s USB-A port that also offers 7.5W charging for small devices. It&#x27;s priced at $50.

There&#x27;s a 4K 60Hz HDMI port, a microSD card slot, an SD card slot, a USB-C 10Gb/s data port, a USB-A 10Gb/s data port, and a USB-A 10Gb/s data port that also offers 7.5W charging. The 6-in-1 USB-C hub is priced at $80.





Each hub is about 5 inches long and 1.5 inches wide, and they are designed to clamp to the front of the ‌iMac‌ by using one of the rear USB-C ports. The hubs are sold with seven color matching faceplates so you can choose the one that works with your ‌iMac‌.





Both of the new HyperDrive Hubs can be purchased from the Hyper website starting today.

                    <span>Apple will be donating to Hurricane Ida relief and recovery efforts on the ground after the devastating category four storm made landfall in Louisiana over the weekend, according to a tweet from Apple CEO Tim Cook.





&quot;Our thoughts are with everyone in Hurricane Ida&#x27;s path, especially those sheltering in Louisiana, and we&#x27;re grateful for the first responders who are helping keep communities safe,&quot; said Cook. He did not provide any further details about the donation plans, including how much money the company will be donating or to who and where the funds will be distributed.

Hurricane Ida made landfall near Port Fourchon, Louisiana on Sunday with 150 mph wind speeds, becoming the second most intense hurricane to strike the U.S. state, behind only Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The storm has caused extensive damage in parts of Louisiana and resulted in nearly one million people being without power in New Orleans and elsewhere.



Apple routinely donates to relief efforts following natural disasters around the world, such as hurricanes, floods, and wildfires.

                    <span>Tapbots today released version 6.3 of Tweetbot for the iPhone and iPad, with the key new feature being a &quot;Behaviors&quot; menu in the app&#x27;s settings that contains several toggle switches for fine tuning your Tweetbot experience. 





For example, while tapping the status bar in the Tweetbot app will bring you to the top of your timeline by default, users who dislike this feature can now turn it off in the &quot;Behaviors&quot; menu by toggling off &quot;Tap to Top.&quot;

Here&#x27;s everything in the &quot;Behaviors&quot; menu to start:
- Enable/Disable Tap to Top. By default, tapping the status bar will bring you to the top of your timeline. If this happens by accident and bugs you, you can now turn this feature off.

- Enable/Disable Drag &amp; Drop Tweets. If you always accidentally invoke the drag and drop feature and wish there was a way to turn that off, now you can!

- Enable/Disable Swipe to Switch Themes. Swiping up or down with two fingers normally switches to the next or previous theme. If this happens by accident far too often you can now turn this feature off.

- Enable the ability to Customize All Tabs. For years many of you have asked for the ability to customize all the tab buttons in Tweetbot. Well, finally you can now turn this option on and set your tab menubar exactly how you wish.

- Before, the short right swipe on a tweet gesture was configurable between liking or retweeting. Now you can also customize this gesture to open link to tweet, copy link to tweet, copy tweet text, add to reading list, or be disabled completely.
The latest version of Tweetbot also features additional iPad keyboard shortcuts, a new custom app icon, a new &quot;Harvest&quot; light theme, and more.

                    <span>South Korea has delayed voting on a bill that would ban Apple and Google from requiring developers to use their in-app purchasing systems, a move that would open the door to allowing third-party payment methods, representing a possible significant threat to Apple and Google&#x27;s app marketplace business models.





The bill, coming in the form of an amendment to the existing Telecommunications Business Act, was widely reported to have been voted on today. However, the National Assembly&#x27;s schedule and agenda lacked mention of the amendment, instead focusing on other bills on the press, economy, and more. A date for the assembly to vote on the bill has not yet been set.



The bill, if it passes, will aim to stop Apple and Google from unfairly exploiting their position to &quot;force a pr…</span>

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/30/australia-continues-apple-pay-scrutiny/">

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(8 min)</span>
                    <span>The government of Australia is considering creating new laws that could more heavily regulate digital payments systems such as Apple Pay, Google Pay, and WeChat Pay (via Reuters).





An Australian government-commissioned report into digital payments systems has made a number of recommendations, one of which suggested actively regulating ‌Apple Pay‌ and other similar digital payments services. Speaking to the Australian Financial Review, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said that the recommendations would be carefully considered:
Ultimately, if we do nothing to reform the current framework, it will be Silicon Valley alone that determines the future of our payments system, a critical piece of our economic infrastructure.




Under current Australian law, the likes of ‌Apple Pay‌ are not classified as payment systems, putting them outside payment regulations. Classifying ‌Apple Pay‌ as a payment system would clarify the regulatory status of digital wallets in Australia and allow the government to explicitly designate big tech companies as payment providers.



Other recommendations, contingent on classifying ‌Apple Pay‌ as a payment system, look to establish a strategy for the country&#x27;s wider payments ecosystem with a single, integrated licensing framework.



Australian banks such as the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia have previously raised concerns around the growth of digital wallets with &quot;competition issues&quot; and purported safety implications. Earlier this year, an Australian Parliamentary Committee considered forcing Apple to open up the iPhone&#x27;s NFC chip to support third-party payment systems in an effort to promote competition.

                    <span>Apple has today shared a trailer for &quot;The Problem with Jon Stewart&quot; and announced a companion podcast for the show, ahead of its premiere on Thursday, September 30.








Stewart himself stars in and executive produces the current affairs show, in what will be the former &quot;Daily Show&quot; host&#x27;s first series since he left Comedy Central in 2015. Apple describes the series as follows:



&quot;The Problem With Jon Stewart&quot; is a multiple-season, single-issue series, taking a deep dive on the issues affecting us most. In this new Apple Original series, Stewart will be in conversation with the people who are impacted by the issue — as well as those who have a hand in creating the impact. Together, they will discuss a more productive path towards action.




The Problem With Jon Stewart has been anticipated for almost a year, with Stewart having signed a multi-year partnership with Apple TV+. In July, Apple shared a short teaser for the show on Twitter that poked fun at the billionaire space race. 



The show is also set to be accompanied by a podcast series that will be available via Apple Podcasts and RSS, the company has today announced. 



The companion series podcast will extend the conversation from each episode, featuring staff members from across the show who will bring us interviews with activists in the space, the facts on the issue, and yes, lots of jokes.









A new episode of The Problem with Jon Stewart will follow on ‌Apple TV+‌ every other week from September 30. The first episode of the companion podcast will also debut on September 30, with new episodes every week where available.

                    <span>Michiko Kakutani, writing for The New York Times:
In 1960, while working as an artist and graphic designer, and some
years before the Rolling Stones were born, Charlie Watts began
work on “Ode to a High-Flying Bird,” a captivating children’s
book about his hero, the jazz great Charlie Parker. The book
featured charming drawings of a bird named Charlie who realized he
didn’t sound like most of the other birds, and who left home to
fly to New York City, where he played “from his heart” and made a
new nest for himself in “Birdland.”
Charlie Parker made a 14-year-old Charlie Watts dream the
impossible dream of visiting New York and playing at a jazz club.
And while he thought at the time that “the only way to get to New
York was in a band on a cruise ship,” he would actually get there
in 1964 with the Rolling Stones. While Keith Richards and Mick
Jagger hung out at the Apollo, where James Brown was doing
five — five! — shows a day, Mr. Watts spent his free time
haunting the jazz clubs he’d dreamed about as a boy: He saw
Charles Mingus at Birdland, Gene Krupa at the Metropole, and Sonny
Rollins, Earl Hines and Miles Davis.
Lovely memorial, with some great quotes from his bandmates.

It’s quote roundup time!
 At long last, development camp is here! The Flyers kicked off their on-ice sessions yesterday, and we were able to check in with some of the prospects for the first time in a few months, or in some cases, the first time ever. And with those first looks of the players on the ice, we also got to hear from a handful of the players to get some insight into their mindsets and goals heading into camp. Let’s check in with Egor Zamula, Wade Allison, Morgan Frost, Cam York, and Same Tuomaala, shall we?

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *A rare bit of fun happened in the NHL over the weekend, as the Carolina Hurricanes revealed a year-long grudge by offer-sheeting Jesperi Kotkaniemi, who obviously accepted their offer. [Canes Country] [Habs Eyes On The Prize]
*They’ll wait until the last possible moment to make their decision public, but the Habs probably won’t match. Because it doesn’t make sense for them to do so. [ProHockeyTalk]
*Anyway, the Flyers. Decidedly less fun over the weekend, but Development Camp got underway yesterday and we’re getting our first look — or first look in a while — at some of the young guys. Like Morgan Frost, who is coming off of surgery.
Nice work with the puck here by Frost. pic.twitter.com/oYaRzYKCPs

*The Flyers previewed the forwards last week, here’s a rundown of the defensemen and goalies getting a look at camp right now. [Flyers]
*In case you forgot, Sean Couturier is a very good dude who really really wants to be a Flyers. [NBC Sports Philly]
*And with the Coots contract out of the way, focus turns to Claude Giroux. Another good dude who really really wants to be a Flyers. [NBC Sports Philly]
*But the Flyers are in no rush with G. And that’s a good thing! [ProHockeyTalk]
*And finally, have you been keeping up with the women’s Worlds? We’re used to the Canada-USA rivalry in women’s hockey being rather evenly matched but so far, this year, Team Canada seems to be the best team running away. [The Athletic]</span>

 Hayao Miyazaki’s influence is seen beyond film, and in games across the entire industry. But never before have I felt as if I was playing inside of a Studio Ghibli film until my hourlong experience with Behind the Frame: The Finest Scenery.
Created by Taiwanese developer Silver Lining Studio, Behind the Frame is mostly a short, interactive-fiction game about a painter finishing a last piece of artwork before submitting it to a gallery in New York.
Behind the Frame takes place in the painter’s lush studio apartment over the course of a few  days as she slowly works her way through the painting. It’s easy to get pulled into the Ghibli-like style and animation, which is set to a soft, “lo-fi”  soundtrack. Painting happens leisurely: a stroke of yellow here, a swath of…</span>

Also fight off a horde of dangerous Sesame Street characters
 The moment I saw Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator I fell in love with how each organ pulses and writhes. In the game, you play as a powerful alien overlord, buying and selling organs. While you’ll spend plenty of time in the market, you’ll also get to choose what to do with those organs and who you kill for them.

Bungie doesn’t want players to feel like they’ve had abilities taken away in The Witch Queen
 At its Destiny Showcase last week, Bungie revealed that Destiny 2’s old Light subclasses will get the Stasis treatment, starting in The Witch Queen expansion and continuing throughout Year 5. While players seem to universally prefer to the less rigid Stasis upgrade path to the original Light ones, players may have had some concerns about what they might lose in the conversion. But in an interview with Polygon, Destiny 2 game director Joe Blackburn and general manager Justin Truman allayed those fears. 
“There are no plans right now, for us, for players to lose anything substantial in the conversion,” said Blackburn. “If you’re talking about something like Nova Warp, or if y…</span>

No more Conduit Energy, and switch Covenants without limitation
 World of Warcraft’s Shadowlands update 9.1.5 will roll out in the game’s public test realm this week, bringing with it a raft of player-requested and suggested changes, as well as new efforts to curb toxic behavior and sanction players who don’t get the message.
The 9.1.5 content update closely follows the 9.1 patch, which launched in June, four months after it was first announced. The 9.1 update was the first big content patch for World of Warcraft: Shadowlands since the expansion launched in November. The newest patch will allow players to switch Covenants without restriction (including the use of their cosmetic rewards), and will remove the Conduit Energy system, which was effectively…</span>

Motive Studio will discuss development in surprise stream
 Electronic Arts and developer Motive Studio will give Dead Space fans a “very early look” at the development of the sci-fi horror game’s remake on Tuesday. That sneak peek will be streamed on Motive’s Twitch channel on Aug. 31 at 1 p.m. EDT/10 a.m. PDT.
Given the language used in EA’s tweet — a “very early look at the development” — it’s unclear just how much we’ll see of the new Dead Space itself. EA and Motive didn’t promise a trailer or gameplay, so set your expectations accordingly. (EA hasn’t even announced a release window for the new Dead Space yet.)
The passionate team at @MotiveStudio are bringing you in for a very early look at the development of #DeadSpace.

The game was in beta for two years
 Lego Star Wars Battles, a mobile real-time strategy game that was shut down in July, is getting re-released as an Apple Arcade exclusive. The game was soft-launched in a few countries in 2019, and its servers were shuttered in 2021.
Developer TT Games Brighton announced the relaunch on Monday. The studio did not give an exact release date, saying only that the game is “coming soon.” Lego Star Wars Battles’ servers were unceremoniously shut off earlier this year, with players notified in advance via an in-game message.
“We are sorry to say that LEGO Star Wars Battles will be closing,” TT Games Brighton announced in May. The studio instructed players to use any remaining in-game currency before the game was taken offline on July 1. Media and Lego Star Wars Battles players took the shutdown to mean the game was canceled.
Polygon has reached out to publisher Warner Bros. Games for more information.
Soon to be available as an Apple Arcade exclusive, Lego Star Wars Battles will require a subscription. Games on Apple’s service are playable with a $4.99-a-month fee, which lets players access more than 150 titles. The games are ad-free, but playable only as long as a subscription is active. Sometimes, Apple Arcade exclusives will later receive a console or Windows PC release after some time.
Lego Star Wars Battles spans the franchise, but most importantly, there are porgs.</span>

                    <span>Steal some crypto for the resistance in Watch Dogs: Legion
 Watch Dogs: Legion now has heists. Well, at least one heist. In a new crossover event between Legion and Netflix show Money Heist, players can group up with friends to steal cryptocurrency from Clan Kelly — one of the game’s enemy factions. 
Players and up to three other friends can roll up to the Bank of London starting Monday in Watch Dogs: Legion. The group will take on Clan Kelly, some guards, and a powerful firewall while wearing the signature jumpsuits from Money Heist, as well as some Guy Fawkes-esque masks covering their faces. 
The trailer shows players sneaking through the bank at night, incapacitating guards with their buddies. But if going loud is more your style, the group will also have shotguns, pistols, and other weapons to keep guards and Clan Kelly on the backfoot. Once the heist crew has secured the crypto, it’s time to ride a drone in the night across the River Thames to make their escape.
Groups that complete the new Money Heist mission will unlock a new outfit for their recruits. 
This isn’t Legion’s first major crossover event this month, with several new, modern-day Assassin’s Creed missions appearing in the game last week alongside update 5.5.</span>

                    <span>Along with an increase in size for the upcoming Apple Watch Series 7, which is rumored to feature larger 41mm and 45mm sizes, Apple plans to include new watch faces that take advantage of the larger displays.





In the latest publication of his &quot;Power On&quot; newsletter, Bloomberg&#x27;s Mark Gurman has put his weight behind recent rumors suggesting that thanks to smaller bezels and a flat-edged design, the upcoming Apple Watch will feature larger case sizes. 



Compared to the current 40mm and 44mm sizes, the Series 7 will be offered in 41mm and 45mm variants. Gurman says that Apple plans to make the larger screen real-estate worthwhile by bundling it with new Apple Watch faces that utilize the larger displays.  

This year&#x27;s watches will come in 41-millimeter and 45-millimeter sizes, up from 40 and 44 millimeters. I&#x27;m told that Apple will bundle multiple new watch faces to take advantage of the bigger screen, including an updated Infograph Modular face. This will be the second time in the Apple Watch&#x27;s history that the company has increased the display size, following the Apple Watch Series 4 in 2017. 
The new Apple Watch faces will be exclusive to the Series 7 and will likely not be made available through a software update for older models. 



Besides cosmetic changes, the Apple Watch Series 7 is expected to include improved performance and battery life. The Apple Watch Series 7 is expected to be unveiled at an all-digital Apple Event in September alongside the iPhone 13. Learn more about what we&#x27;re expecting this fall using our guide.

                    <span>Apple has made season one of mystery drama &quot;Home Before Dark&quot; available to watch for free on Apple TV+ for a limited time, no subscription required.






The official announcement, delivered on Saturday in a tweet, comes three weeks after the conclusion of the second season. 



&quot;Home Before Dark&quot; is a drama series about Hilde Lysiak, a child journalist who published a newspaper called the Orange Street News in her hometown of Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania.



The series follows the young girl as she moves from Brooklyn to the small lakeside town her father is from, where she unearths a cold case that everyone else in the town had attempted to bury. 

A mystery inspired by the reporting of a real nine-year-old journalist. When a young girl and her family move back to the small town her father left behind, her pursuit of the truth leads to the unearthing of a long-buried cold case.
In real life, Hilde Lysiak was the first to report on a murder in her town of Selinsgrove, which gave her paper, Orange Street News, national and international media attention. Season 2 premiered on June 11.




For a limited time, you can watch Season 1 of Home Before Dark for free, exclusively on Apple TV+ https://t.co/lkdhusWjEN pic.twitter.com/jaDjSIk1Rv

While the feature was previewed at WWDC in June, it&#x27;s yet to make an official appearance in any developer beta of ‌macOS Monterey‌ or ‌iPadOS 15‌, leading to speculation that the feature may be delayed to a future update to the operating systems. However, in the latest ‌macOS Monterey‌ beta released on August 11, Universal Control can be enabled and used between two Macs. 



To enable it, users will need to follow the steps outlined in this GitHub post, which requires running a series of Terminal lines, altering system settings, and running commands to enable &quot;Ensemble,&quot; Ap…</span>

                    <span>Keep in mind as you watch this that Jony Ive left Apple two years ago, and Apple dropped headphone jacks from new iPhones five years ago starting with the iPhones 7. Google’s own high-end Pixels dropped headphone jacks in 2017. As of next month, 40 percent of all iPhone model years will have been headphone-jack-free. This feels about as relevant as mocking the original iMac for not having a floppy drive.

                    <span>Yang Jie, Stephanie Yang, and Yoko Kubota, reporting for The Wall Street Journal (News+):
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. plans to increase the prices of its most advanced chips by roughly 10%, while less advanced chips used by customers like auto makers will cost about 20% more, these people said. The higher prices will generally take effect late this year or next year, the people said.
Apple Inc. is one of TSMC’s largest customers and its iPhones use advanced microprocessors made in TSMC foundries. It couldn’t be determined how much more Apple would pay.
Not just iPhones: TSMC manufactures all “Apple silicon”. And no one else can make them. Really, this is just Econ 101: demand for TSMC chips is high, supply is constrained, so prices are going up.
Update: Compelling alternative theory.

                    <span>Apple today announced the launch of a new service program that addresses an issue that can cause some iPhone 12 and 12 Pro devices to experience sound issues. 





According to Apple, a &quot;very small percentage&quot; of ‌iPhone 12‌ and 12 Pro models may experience sound problems because of a component that can fail on the receiver module. Affected devices were manufactured between October 2020 and April 2021. 



‌iPhone 12‌ and 12 Pro owners who have a device that does not emit sound from the receiver when making or receiving phone calls may be eligible for free service. iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 12 Pro Max models are not affected and are not part of the service program. 



Those who have an iPhone experiencing issues can make an appointment at an Apple retail location, or find an Apple Authorized Service Provider. Apple Support can also be contacted to arrange a mail-in repair. 



‌iPhone 12‌ or 12 Pro models that have damage that impairs the ability to complete the repair, like a cracked screen, will need to have that issue fixed prior to receiving service. Apple says the repair program covers affected ‌iPhone 12‌ or 12 Pro devices for two years after the first retail sale of the device.

                    <span>Apple made some notable improvements to the Health app in iOS 15, primarily focused on helping iPhone users care for elderly parents and others who might need additional medical oversight and help.





There are extensive sharing features that let users keep an eye on the health data of a loved one, plus bonus features like walking steadiness metrics and improvements to how lab results are presented. This guide highlights all of the new additions in the ‌iOS 15‌ Health app.





Walking Steadiness


Walking Steadiness is a new health metric that uses data culled from the ‌iPhone‌ to provide insight into a person&#x27;s risk of falling down.





It uses algorithms that assess balance, strength, and gait, using metrics like walking speed, step length, and walking asymmetry d…</span>

                    <span>T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert today penned a letter to T-Mobile customers apologizing for the recent data breach that impacted more than 50 million current, former, and prospective T-Mobile users.





Data that included names, phone numbers, addresses, birth dates, social security numbers, driver&#x27;s license and ID info, IMEI numbers, and IMSI numbers was stolen and has been offered for sale.



&quot;We didn&#x27;t live up to the expectations we have for ourselves to protect our customers,&quot; wrote Sievert. &quot;Knowing that we failed to prevent this exposure is one of the hardest parts of this event. On behalf of everyone at Team Magenta, I want to say we are truly sorry.&quot;

                    <span>Apple is further pushing its employees in the United States to get vaccinated now that the Food and Drug Administration has officially approved the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, reports Bloomberg.





Apple has launched a new internal web page, sent out an employee memo, and is holding internal talks as part of its vaccination campaign.
&quot;Apple is asking everyone who has access to the vaccine and is able to get vaccinated to do so as soon as you can,&quot; the company said in the memo, which was sent to staff Thursday evening. Sumbul Desai, Apple&#x27;s vice president of health efforts, and Kristina Raspe, vice president in charge of real estate, are also hosting talks to encourage employees to get the shots.
The webpage Apple has created explains the delta variant and how getting vaccinated can help prevent its spread. Apple is also offering vouchers for employees to get vaccinated through Walgreens, and it is providing on-site vaccinations in the San Francisco Bay Area and Austin, Texas. Apple gives employees paid time off for vaccine appointments and paid sick leave for those who experience side effects.



Apple is not mandating that its employees get vaccinated, which is a departure from other tech companies in the area. Both Google and Facebook are requiring employees to be vaccinated, but according to Bloomberg, Apple has not done so for the sake of employee privacy.



Earlier this month, Apple implemented more frequent testing for corporate and retail employees, asking them to take COVID-19 tests up to three times per week.



Apple initially planned to have employees return to work for three days a week in September, but with cases continuing to ramp up, corporate employees will be able to work from home until at least January 2022.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Google today shared a new Pixel 5a ad that&#x27;s meant to parody some of the product intro videos that former Apple design chief Jony Ive used to make to highlight new iPhone features.






In the video, Google spends a full two minutes describing the design of the Pixel 5a&#x27;s headphone jack in exaggeratory language, and as noted by CNET, there are even two moments where the video uses Ive&#x27;s British pronunciation of aluminum. From the video description:
Calling this perfectly-symmetrical, technological marvel, a &quot;headphone jack&quot; may feel like an understatement...but technically, that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s called, so... fair enough. Behold! The Headphone Jack, on the Google Pixel 5a with 5G.
Since Jony Ive is no longer Apple&#x27;s design chief and does not make Apple&#x27;s product videos, it&#x27;s not clear why Google has opted to make a video imitating him two years after he left the company. A video promoting the headphone jack is also an unusual choice as fervor over the component has died down now that many high-end smartphones have eliminated it, including Google&#x27;s own flagship Pixel models. 



The $449 Pixel 5a goes on sale today. In addition to a headphone jack, it features a 6.3-inch display with hole punch camera cutout, IP67 water resistance, 5G connectivity, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G chip.



Google&#x27;s Pixel 5a competes with the $699 iPhone 12 mini and the $399 iPhone SE at the current time, but Apple plans to release an upgraded 5G version of the iPhone SE for 2022.

We&#x27;re not expecting new health features this year, and if there are new health sensors, Apple has kept them under wraps, but multiple rumors have indicated that the Apple Watch Series 7 is getting a new design.



The upcoming Apple Watch could feature a flat-edged design that&#x27;s similar to the design of the iPhone 12 and the iPad Pro. Leaked renders said to be based on CAD drawings have depicted iPhone-12 style flat curves, a thinner Digital Crown, and new speaker design on the left side of t…</span>

                    <span>Apple has shared a trailer for the original film &quot;Come From Away,&quot; which is set to debut on September 10, as an unlisted video on the Apple TV YouTube channel.






Directed by Christopher Ashley, who directed the original Broadway production, Come From Away is a recording of the Tony Award-winning Broadway musical of the same name that was filmed live at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theater in New York City.



The musical centers on the true story of when 38 flights were grounded in Gander, Newfoundland, leaving 7,000 passengers in a small Canadian town after flights into the United States were briefly suspended in 2001.
&quot;Come From Away&quot; tells the story of 7,000 people stranded in the small town of Gander, Newfoundland after all flights into the US are grounded on September 11, 2001. As the people of Newfoundland graciously welcome the &quot;come from aways&quot; into their community in the aftermath, the passengers and locals alike process what&#x27;s happened while finding love, laughter and new hope in the unlikely and lasting bonds that they forge.
Apple said earlier this year that the live performance of Come From Away was filmed in May with an audience of 9/11 survivors and front-line workers.



Come From Away premieres exclusively on Apple TV+ on Friday, September 10. &quot;The Problem With Jon Stewart,&quot; &quot;9/11: Inside the President&#x27;s War Room,&quot; &quot;The Morning Show&quot; Season 2, and &quot;Foundation&quot; are also set to arrive next month.

                    <span>Twitter has started rolling out its new Ticketed Spaces feature to iOS users, the company has announced.





Twitter Spaces allow users to host live audio discussions that other users can listen in to. Now, some Twitter users on iOS will be able to create Ticketed Spaces that have a small fee to join, allowing hosts to make money from sales directly on the popular social media platform.



Users over the age of 18 who have hosted at least three Spaces in the past 30 days and have at least 1,000 followers have been able to apply to host Ticketed Spaces since June, but the feature has not been live until now.




we want to help people creating cool Spaces make $$$. today, some Hosts will be able create Ticketed Spaces! 
we’re experimenting on iOS only for now but we hope to get it to everyone soon. know it’s taking us a little time, but we want to get this right for you! https://t.co/xc68yWkOim
— Spaces (@TwitterSpaces) August 26, 2021
 




Hosts receive 67 percent of the proceeds from ticket sales, with 30 percent going to Apple as an in-app purchase fee and three percent going to Twitter. If a host&#x27;s total lifetime earnings on Twitter pass $50,000, then Twitter plans to raise its commission rate to 20 percent.



It is not clear how many users are now eligible to host Ticketed Spaces or when Twitter plans to roll out the functionality to all users. Even so, any iOS user is able to buy a ticket to join a Ticketed Spaces session.

                    <span>Apple on Thursday evening announced it has reached a $100 million settlement that, pending court approval, will resolve a class action lawsuit from U.S. developers who alleged that Apple has a monopoly on the distribution of iOS apps and in-app purchases.





As part of the settlement, some U.S. developers would be entitled to receive a payment from Apple, so long as they meet certain requirements.



Who is eligible for a payment from Apple?


According to law firm Hagens Berman, which brought the lawsuit against Apple in 2019, the class includes any current or former U.S. developer of an iOS app that earned less than $1 million through the U.S. App Store in paid downloads and/or in-app purchases/subscriptions per calendar year between June 4, 2015 and April 26, 2021.

                    <span>It&#x27;s no secret that Apple and Google have a considerable monetary agreement that ensures Google&#x27;s position as the default search engine on Apple&#x27;s devices. In a new investor note by financial advisor Bernstein&#x27;s Toni Sacconaghi, the analyst claims Google&#x27;s payment to Apple to maintain the status quo could reach $15 billion in 2021, up from $10 billion last year.





First reported by Ped30, Sacconaghi&#x27;s note estimates that Google&#x27;s payments to Apple could continue increasing on-year and approach $18-20 billion in 2022. The Bernstein analyst bases his numbers on Apple&#x27;s public filings as well as a bottom-up analysis of Google&#x27;s traffic acquisition costs.

                    <span>Apple today announced plans to make several changes to the App Store in order to settle a class-action lawsuit that was brought against Apple by developers in the United States.





Under the terms of the deal, Apple will let developers use communication methods like email to tell customers about payment methods available outside of iOS apps, and it will expand the price points that developers can offer for apps, in-app purchases, and subscriptions. Apple also plans to create a $100 million &quot;fund&quot; for small developers as part of the settlement, and it will release annual transparency reports on the app review process.

                    <span>Kait Sanchez, writing for The Verge:
On TikTok, Rolling Stone found videos, some of which had more than a million views, promoting ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment under tags like #ivermectin4covid and #ivermectinworks. TikTok has since removed the videos for violating community guidelines and blocked the tags, and a spokesperson says TikTok will continue removing related videos and hashtags. The #ivermectin tag is still up, though many of the most popular videos in the tag are of healthcare professionals debunking misinformation.

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *Very exciting day yesterday, as a key player was locked up long term by his organization. Talking, of course, about the Svechnikov extension! [Canes Country]
*KIDDING. It was Coots Day yesterday and it’s going to be Coots time for the next eight years as the Flyers locked up arguably their best player for the longest possible term. [BSH]
*Charlie breaks down the details of the deal. [The Athletic]
*The contract Chuck worked out with Couturier turns out to be a real bargain for the Flyers, but still gives Coots the raise he has earned. [NBC Sports Philly]
*If he plays out this contract, Sean Couturier will be the longest-tenured Flyer in the organizations history. That’s wild! [Inquirer]
*The contract is unquestionably a good one, but deals this long don’t come without a little risk. [ProHockeyTalk]
*Anyway remember that little Derick Brassard signing? That was good too. [Flyers]
*Also, Dev Camp is upon us!! Here’s a look at the forwards we’ll be seeing this weekend. [Flyers]
*And finally, just in time for your weekend... new BSH Radio! A lot to talk about, obviously. All good stuff. [BSH]</span>

Pinnacle endgame content is Destiny’s lifeblood, and it’s about to get an infusion
 Bungie’s Destiny Showcase on Tuesday revealed a ton of exciting news for Guardians. Destiny 2 has a lot coming to it over the next few years, with crafting, three expansions, a new weapon type, reworks for existing subclasses, the return of Gjallarhorn, and a continuation into a whole new story after 2024’s The Final Shape expansion. But the showcase’s most important announcement came and went in a flash: Starting this December, Destiny 2 players will get a new raid or dungeon every three months. 
Destiny’s raids take six players to new locations and pit them against puzzle-filled arenas or giant bosses.…</span>

Bungie’s weekly blog highlighted what players can expect from their Void subclasses next February
 Bungie revealed at its Destiny Showcase that all of Destiny 2’s Light subclasses — Arc, Solar, and Void — will undergo a conversion to the Darkness/Stasis system over the next year. Just a few days later, the studio gave players their first look at the first subclass getting updated: Void. 
The studio first revealed that players won’t unlock a new Darkness subclass in The Witch Queen or any point before Destiny 2’s 2023 expansion, Lightfall — something creative director Joe Blackburn discussed on a Twitch stream an hour prior. Bungie also said players won’t unlock new Stasis Aspects or Fragments in Season of the Lost.

Boost your vitality and magic by praying at shrines
 Death’s Door can be hard to the low amount of vitality and magic you can have at once, but you can gain more of both by finding shrines. Shrines are hidden structures with monstrous faces found around the world, and they each give a crystal — pink for magic and green for health. Our Death’s Door guide will list out where to find all the shrines with maps.
There are 16 shrines throughout the game. Eight of them are for vitality and eight of them are for magic. To increase your health or magic bars, you need to collect four shards from shrines.
We’ve listed the shrines in the order you can access them below. Some of the shrines are in early areas, but require abilities that you don’t …</span>

                    <span>Samsung earlier this month unveiled the new Galaxy Z Fold 3, its latest flagship foldable smartphone. We thought we&#x27;d check out the Z Fold 3 to see the technology improvements that Samsung has made to its foldable smartphone lineup.

Foldable smartphones are still expensive, and as a Samsung flagship, the Z Fold 3 is priced starting at $1,799.99, which is more than you have to shell out for some computers. Of course, this is meant to serve as both a phone and a tablet, so there&#x27;s a little more versatility than your average smartphone.





Design wise, the Z Fold 3 is Samsung&#x27;s best foldable device yet because the camera is under the display for an all-display design. It looks great and while it&#x27;s not entirely hid…</span>

                    <span>T-Mobile recently suffered a significant data breach that saw sensitive data from more than 50 million current, prospective, and former customers stolen.





John Binns, a 21-year-old American who lives in Turkey, told The Wall Street Journal that he is responsible for the attack. Binns said that he discovered an unprotected router in July after scanning T-Mobile&#x27;s known internet addresses for weak spots.



He used the unprotected router to access T-Mobile&#x27;s data center located in Washington, where stored credentials provided him access to over 100 servers. He said he initially panicked because he &quot;had access to something big,&quot; and went on to claim that T-Mobile&#x27;s &quot;security is awful.&quot;

                    <span>Apple today released a new firmware update designed for the AirTag item trackers. The refreshed firmware has a version number of 1.0.291 and a build number of 1A291a, up from 1A287b.





There&#x27;s no word on what new features the firmware might add, but firmware released back in June added anti-stalking enhancements.



There is no way to force an AirTag update, as it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s done over-the-air through a connected iPhone. To make sure the update happens, you can put your AirTag in range of your ‌‌iPhone‌‌, but you have to wait for the firmware to roll out to your device.



You can check your current AirTag firmware version through the Find My app, with instructions available in our how to.

                    <span>Classic puzzle game Myst has been revived on the Mac and an optimized version of the title is now available for M1 Macs.





Cyan has undertaken a rework of the game that takes advantage of Metal 2.1 and AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution for a 50 percent performance boost on ‌M1‌ Macs that does not impact game quality.



Myst for ‌M1‌ Macs features improved modeling, textures, and dynamic lighting effects, and Apple&#x27;s machines are able to run the game at 4K resolution without noisy fans. It&#x27;s also been reimagined for a VR gaming experience.



Myst is compatible with both Intel and ‌M1‌ Macs. According to the system requirements, it works with the following machines:



 	
All MacBook Pros released since 2018


 	
All iMacs released since 2019


 	
All iMac Pros released since 2017


 	
All MacBook Airs released since 2018


 	
All Mac Pros released since 2019


 	
All Mac minis released since 2018




The updated version of Myst can be downloaded from the Mac App Store for $29.99.

                    <span>Netflix earlier this year confirmed plans to get into mobile gaming, and now the company is testing its gaming experience with Netflix users in Poland.





Netflix&#x27;s Polish Twitter account today tweeted that the Android Netflix app in Poland is offering access to &quot;Stranger Things 1984&quot; and &quot;Stranger Things 3,&quot; two mobile game options.



According to NetflixGeeked, the games are included with a Netflix membership and feature no ads or in-app purchases, similar to how Apple Arcade works. The games are downloaded directly to a mobile device from Netflix and are not streamed from the Netflix app. 



As noted by CNET, the games that are being offered have been available for a few years outside of the Netflix app and were created in partnership with Netflix for the second and third seasons of &quot;Stranger Things.&quot;



Back in July, Netflix said that it considered gaming to be another new content category, similar to its expansion into original films, animation, and unscripted television.



With its expansion into mobile gaming, Netflix will compete directly with ‌Apple Arcade‌, Apple&#x27;s $4.99 per month gaming service that allows users to access hundreds of ad-free games on the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV.



Given that the two games Netflix is experimenting with are already existing titles, we may need to wait for some time to see where Netflix plans to take its mobile gaming feature in the future.

                    <span>The Apple Watch continues to be the most popular smart watch on the market, and in Q2 2021, Apple hit a new user base milestone, according to Counterpoint Research&#x27;s Global Smartwatch Shipments Tracker.





There are now more than 100 million active Apple Watch users thanks to the device&#x27;s design, health features, and related services. It&#x27;s possible Apple hit this milestone even earlier than 2021, as Neil Cybart said in February that based on his estimates, Apple reached 100 million users in December.



In the second quarter of 2021, global smart watch shipments were up 27 percent overall, and Apple was able to maintain its number one position. Apple&#x27;s market share was at 28 percent, down slightly from 30 percent in the year-ago quarter, but well above competitors like Huawei, Samsung, and Garmin.



The United States continues to be Apple&#x27;s largest market, responsible for more than half of the Apple Watch user base.



During the quarter, the Apple Watch Series 6 was the most popular smart watch overall, followed by the Apple Watch SE. The Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 took the third spot, followed by the Apple Watch Series 3 in fourth and the Imoo Z6-4G in fifth.





Apple in just a few weeks is set to debut its newest wrist-worn device, the Apple Watch Series 7. The Series 7 will feature the first redesign we&#x27;ve seen in years, with Apple adopting a flat-edged design, a larger display, and new 41mm and 45mm case sizes.



We&#x27;re expecting Apple to debut the new Apple Watch Series 7 models alongside the iPhone 13 lineup, and we could be hearing details on an event date within the next two weeks.

                    <span>Refurbished M1 Mac mini models with a 10Gb ethernet port are now available from the Apple Store, following the launch of the $100 build-to-order option in April.





The refurbished units were first spotted by Paul Haddad on Twitter. There are currently a range of refurbished ‌M1‌ ‌Mac mini‌ configurations with 10Gb ethernet available with different amounts of storage, although stock appears to be selling out quickly. Going forward, stock will fluctuate based on which machines customers are sending back to Apple for repairs and returns.



Spot checks show that the refurbished ‌M1‌ models with 10Gb ethernet are now available in multiple regions, including the United States, Canada, France, and Japan.



When buying the ‌M1‌ ‌Mac mini‌ new, customers have to use a build-to-order configuration to upgrade from standard Gigabit ethernet to 10Gb ethernet for an additional $100. A refurbished ‌M1‌ ‌Mac mini‌ with 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and 10Gb ethernet sells for $849, which is a $150 saving on the same machine if bought new.



Apple&#x27;s refurbished ‌‌M1‌‌ Mac minis are sold with the same one-year warranty offered with a new ‌‌Mac mini‌, and they come with all manuals and accessories. Apple uses a rigorous testing, repair, repackaging, and cleaning process to ensure refurbished devices are identical to new devices.

                    <span>Apple today announced a News Partner Program that will allow publishers who are committed to publishing their content through Apple News to qualify for a reduced 15% commission rate on qualifying in-app subscriptions.





In exchange for maintaining a &quot;robust&quot; presence on Apple News, publishers enrolled in the program will receive 85% of the revenue from readers who subscribe through the publication&#x27;s own app on the App Store.

Publishers may apply for the program starting today worldwide. To be eligible, publishers must maintain an Apple News channel and publish all content to that channel in the Apple News Format. Further details are available on Apple&#x27;s website.



Apple will also support, fund, and collaborate with additional media literacy organizations around the world, and the company has recommitted support to three leading non-profit organizations that offer independent media literacy programs, including Common Sense Media, the News Literacy Project, and Osservatorio Permanente Giovani-Editori.

                    <span>Days after celebrating his tenth anniversary at Apple&#x27;s helm, Tim Cook is poised to receive a whopping $750 million of Apple&#x27;s stock this week as the final installment of his pay deal with Apple, put in place over a decade ago when he took over the company, Bloomberg reports.





The installment will consist of 5 million shares of Apple&#x27;s stock, equating to be around worth $750 million, according to Bloomberg. Last year, Cook received restricted stock units worth up to $114 million, ensuring he&#x27;ll remain CEO until at least 2025.



Cook, aged 60, has a net worth of roughly $1.5 billion according to Bloomberg&#x27;s Billionaires Index. Though a billionaire, Cook&#x27;s compensation for 2020 was among the most modest compared to other high-paid tech CEOs. In 2020, Cook received $14.7 million, according to SEC filings. 



The CEO has said in the past he donates a portion of his salary and compensation to charitable organizations and plans to give most of his wealth away.

                    <span>An image purporting to show a &quot;45mm&quot; Apple Watch band has surfaced online ahead of the expected unveiling of Apple Watch Series 7 models next month.





The small, low-resolution image, shared by &quot;DuanRui&quot; on Twitter, originated from the Chinese social media network Weibo and appears to show the underside of an Apple Watch band, which could be a Saddle Brown Leather Link band. While it is not clear how reliable this image may be, the 45mm sizing lines up with a number of previous rumors around the Apple Watch Series 7.



Alleged CAD renders of the larger Apple Watch Series 7 suggested that it would sport a 45mm display, a 1mm increase from the current 44mm display on the larger Apple Watch Series 6 model. This is expected to be achieved by making the casing&#x27;s edges flat, which …</span>

                    <span>Apple supplier Foxconn is rushing to hire 200,000 more workers by the end of September to manufacture the iPhone 13 models, according to the South China Morning Post.





The 200,000 additional workers are needed at the world&#x27;s biggest iPhone factory in the Chinese city of Zhengzhou, ahead of the expected launch of the ‌iPhone 13‌ lineup next month. Hiring enough manpower has been the &quot;biggest bottleneck&quot; to production at the manufacturing facility, according to the site&#x27;s deputy general manager, Wang Xue, who was quoted by a local broadcaster. Earlier this month, it was reported that Foxconn was struggling to hire enough workers for ‌iPhone 13‌ production.



The staffing goal is reportedly being supported by local governments, which have provided 100 busses to &quot;pick up job applicants from their communities and drop them at the factory gates.&quot; Foxconn believes that it will be able to hire 200,000 new hires by the end of September &quot;at the current speed of recruitment.&quot; Once hired, new workers will be fast-tracked into their position. 



The Zhengzhou factory can accommodate as many as 350,000 assembly line workers and manufacture up to 500,000 new iPhones every day. The current hiring push seeks to combat ramped-up production for the ‌‌iPhone 13‌‌ models, which are believed to be on track for launch late next month.

                    <span>A photo purporting to show the sticker tabs used to seal Apple products in their boxes appears to confirm the &quot;iPhone 13&quot; name for the company&#x27;s upcoming 2021 iPhone lineup.





The photo was highlighted by &quot;DuanRui&quot; on Twitter, linking to a post on the Chinese social media network Weibo.



The validity of the image is not known, but it is not unusual to see images of ‌iPhone‌ packaging emerging at this time of year as the device&#x27;s launch date approaches. Around three weeks before the launch of the iPhone 12 lineup last year, images of packaging stickers showing the correct naming for those devices were also shared by DuanRui.



While most reliable sources have persistently referred to the 2021 ‌iPhone‌ models as the &quot;‌iPhone 13‌&quot; lineup, there has been a large amount of speculation from some observers on social media and a number of individuals who claim to be leakers with no track record that the upcoming iPhones would in fact be &quot;‌iPhone‌ 12S&quot; models.



A survey from earlier this year suggested that most consumers do not want the devices to be called the &quot;‌iPhone 13‌.&quot; 38 percent of survey respondents said that Apple should call its next smartphone series simply &quot;‌‌iPhone‌‌ (2021),&quot; 26 percent thought that the &quot;‌‌iPhone 13‌‌&quot; was the best name, and only 13 percent said that they would like to see the devices called the &quot;‌‌iPhone‌‌ 12S.&quot;



The ‌iPhone 13‌ lineup is expected to be unveiled next month with a number of new features, including a 120Hz display, larger batteries, new camera features, an &quot;A15&quot; chip, up to 1TB of storage, and more.

According to the report, TSMC is planning to increase the costs of its chip production, impacting several customers, including Apple. TSMC is reportedly looking to increase its costs by as much as 20% for its &quot;advanced and mature process technologies.&quot; The new changes are expected to go into effect in January.

Set to be an unrestricted free agent this summer, Coots is staying in Philadelphia for a while.
 The Philadelphia Flyers are continuing to be at the center of the NHL offseason.
Announced by the team on Thursday afternoon, they have signed top center Sean Couturier to an eight-year, $62-million ($7.75-million AAV) contract. Keeping him with the Flyers through the 2029-2030 season.

With just one year remaining on his sweetheart of a deal signed all the way back in 2015, the Flyers were facing a tough decision if no extension was signed before the season-opener. Wading through different team expectations, Couturier is easily one …</span>

It happens to the best of us.
 This season was a challenging one for the Flyers in a number of departments, that’s no secret. Between the pandemic related struggles and the team’s own underperformance of expectations, the picture wasn’t pretty. It was a difficult mix for everyone, but particularly for young players like Connor Bunnaman, who were left to deal with all of that, and also had to add into the mix the challenge of finding their footing and continuing to get adjusted to playing at the NHL level in the first place. 



After putting in some good work with the Phantoms during the 2019-20 season, Bunnaman was given a well deserved call-up to the Flyers, and a chance to showcase a bit more of the positives of his game. He was certainly abl…</span>

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *The Flyers’ options at center remained the one lingering question as we head into the start of the preseason festivities, so Chuck went ahead and filled in that hole a little bit with another bottom-6 C option for Alain Vigneault to consider. [BSH]
*Vigneault has some history with the new hire too, which might make his decision easier. [NBC Sports Philly]
*Charlie breaks down the signing, as only Charlie can. [The Athletic]
*Speaking of contracts, it’s a contract season for Sean Couturier, arguably the Flyers’ most important player at the moment. So it’s going to be a big season. Big big season. [The Athletic]
*Our last-season reviews continue with everyone’s favorite youth, Joel Farabee... [BSH]
*... and also everyone’s favorite bottom-sixer, Scott Laughton. [BSH]
*As folks begin to preview the season, a look around the Metro suggests that Chuck’s offseason moves weren’t enough — on their own — to make people believe in the Flyers again. [ProHockeyTalk]
*Noted hilarious writer known as DGB has put together fictitious NHL rosters based on some wackadoo parameters in the past, but this one might be the wackadooiest of them all.  Which of course is why it is so fun. [The Athletic]
*And finally, Flyers Aquaman, dream or nightmare? [BSH]</span>

This is April’s second big announcement out of Gamescom
 Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl’s cast is growing by two ... or maybe three? April O’Neil and CatDog are both coming to Nickelodeon’s upcoming fighting game, developers Ludosity and Fair Play Labs announced on Thursday at Gamescom 2021.
April is the beloved friend to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles — several of which are also coming to All-Star Brawl. Based on her trailer, April’s in-game moves will lean into her role as a TV reporter, using her camera as a weapon in some of her attacks, while other will have her deploy a few of the turtles’ weapons as well. 
Weirdly, this is the second game that April has been announced as a playable character in at Gamescom 2021 so far, after she was announced as part of the cast of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge on Wednesday. 
Meanwhile, CatDog fits right at home in All-Star Brawl’s list of fan-favorite characters from old NickToons. CatDog looks fittingly strange in-game and seems to have a move set that takes advantage of both ... halves of their body. It seems like players might even get unique moves depending on which direction CatDog is facing, since Cat and Dog may do slightly different things. 
Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is set to be released on Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X later this year.</span>

The Destiny Timeline is a godsend for players trying to get into Destiny
 Destiny 2’s new Season of the Lost offers the biggest patch of the year. Some of those major changes are large, like a suite of new seasonal activities, weapons, and Exotics. But one of my favorite changes is so small that you might miss it entirely: the Timeline.
Billed in the patch notes for Season of the Lost as a way for players to see what expansions and seasons they own — and purchase any outliers, if they desire — the Timeline is much more than a store. It’s a visual representation of everything that’s happened in Destiny 2 since it launched in 2017. And for new players, it’s a great place to learn what the hell is going on with the baseline story before watching your way int…</span>

Stasis won’t be the only Darkness power forever
 Bungie hasn’t been shy about calling Destiny 2: Beyond Light’s Stasis subclass the “first” new Darkness power set. So Guardians may have been surprised during Tuesday’s Destiny Showcase when Bungie didn’t reveal a new element. In an interview for Twitch’s The Weekly show, Destiny 2 game director Joe Blackburn confirmed that players won’t see a new powerset in The Witch Queen expansion. But he also revealed that one is in development for a future update.
“We knew when we wanted to add another damage type to Destiny, we needed to take more time,” said Blackburn. “We’re not doing a new damage sub-type for Witch Queen. We have one in development, you’re gonna see it eventually, but we really want to make sure we get it right.”
Blackburn went on to speak about the Light subclass rework, which will use the Stasis system added to the game in Beyond Light. The creative director talked up the new reworks for these Light subclasses, suggesting that longtime players will have a lot more tools and combinations to play with. 
It’s currently unclear what the fifth subclass type will be in Destiny 2 — or when players will get their hands on it. But it seems likely that players will have three Light and three Darkness subclasses by the time Destiny 2’s first saga — the battle between Light and Dark — ends with The Final Shape expansion in 2024.</span>

Welcome to Malevento
 Overwatch is primarily a team-based game, but occasionally you prefer something a little less cooperative and a little more aggressive. That’s where the free-for-all deathmatch mode comes in. Eight players battle it out on a map in a frantic race to 20 kills. For fans of this game mode, a new map is coming. Malevento will be the next free-for-all deathmatch map, and it’s coming to the game’s Public Test Region (PTR) on Windows PC today.
Malevento is a Talon base located in Italy, so it’ll likely have a few Easter eggs and lore hints for sharp-eyed fans. This is only the fourth map that is designed specifically for Deathmatch.

McCree was named after a fired real-life Blizzard employee 
 Blizzard Entertainment says it will rename McCree, Overwatch’s outlaw bounty hunter, after his real-life namesake, former game designer Jesse McCree, was let go from the studio in the wake of a sexual harassment and gender discrimination lawsuit filed against publisher Activision Blizzard.
“We believe it’s necessary to change the name of the hero currently known as McCree to something that better represents what Overwatch stands for,” Blizzard’s Overwatch team said in a statement posted Thursday to Twitter announcing the name change.

It’ll be the first Skate game on Windows
 Skate fans with a PC, breathe easy. The newest Skate game — which everyone is calling Skate 4, at least until its actual title is revealed — will be launching on your platform, Electronic Arts said Thursday.
Again, no extra details beyond that; Full Circle developers dropped this quick PC-themed tweet, then got back to work:

— skate. (@skateEA) August 26, 2021



The first three games in EA’s Skate franchise were all console-only, for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Skate fans had worried that a gamepad-intensive game might leave them out, but the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 remaster showed the sport does do well as a Windows PC video game, pulling review scores consistent with console versions’ strong marks.
The next Skate game is in development at Full Circle, a studio formed expressly to handle this sequel. Designers said their project was brought to life purely thanks to fan feedback and social media clamor for a series revival. The Skate franchise’s three games were published between 2007 and 2010.</span>

 Stock car racing has a new engine — Unreal 4 — with NASCAR 21: Ignition, and it gets a close-up in this gameplay trailer Motorsport Games released during Gamescom 2021. The first look at the game’s cars shows presentation and detail that Ignition’s predecessor, the NASCAR Heat series, would struggle to meet with the Unity engine.
NASCAR 21: Ignition is a from-the-ground-up effort, Motorsport Games chief executive Dmitry Kozko told Polygon earlier this month. The new publishing label (a subsidiary of Motorsport.com’s publishing company) picked up the NASCAR franchise last year. This year’s game uses Unreal 4 as well as Studio 397’s proprietary physics package for the rFac…</span>

Discover the March Through Time exhibit from Time Studios
 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s famous “I Have a Dream” speech is now viewable in a Fortnite exhibit. 
Time Studios has launched a new interactive educational experience inside Fortnite Creative called March Through Time. This event acts as a virtual museum for players to explore Washington circa 1963, at the height of the Civil Rights Movement. 
Fortnite players can visit the Lincoln Memorial and the National Mall. They can watch King’s famous speech, which Epic and Time Studios licensed from his family’s estate — a critical piece of history that even the Oscar-nominated 2014 biopic Selma wasn’t able to feature. The interactive exhibit is arriving ahead of the 58th anniversary of the “I Have a Dream” speech, which King delivered from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial on Aug. 28, 1963, during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.

      Players can unlock this Fortnite spray by exploring the MLK exhibit.
  
After the speech, players can further explore the in-game museum and even work together in cooperative minigames. After completing various challenges and exploring the museum, Fortnite players can pick up a “DC 63” wall spray for use in the game.
Fortnite players can dive into the March Through Time experience by finding the link in the Discover Menu, or by inputting a special island code: 3815-8892-143.
The makers of huge gaming platforms like Fortnite are increasingly using them for interactive experiences beyond video games, such as educational opportunities. Last July, after the murder of George Floyd, Fortnite hosted a discussion on race in America. Minecraft also features civil rights education in its Lessons in Good Trouble pack, which features the late congressman John Lewis.
March Through Time was inspired by The March, a 2020 digital exhibit from Time magazine, and was developed by Fortnite community members ChaseJackman, GQuanoe, XWDFr, and YU7A.</span>

 eFootball, the renamed, free-to-play successor to Konami’s Pro Evolution Soccer/Winning Eleven franchise, launches later this fall with a new engine (Unreal 4) running the gameplay. Konami on Thursday published a six-minute trailer showing what that’ll look like, and what players will be able to do with eFootball’s reconstituted attacking and defending controls.
Konami’s developers are focusing on the one-on-one confrontations in soccer, and they’re opening up the ball-handling system to allow attackers more moves to break down a defender. At the same time, defenders who are able to anticipate their opponent’s passes and dribble moves should have a better shot at taking control of the ball — making countera…</span>

The classics get revived on iOS, PC, Switch
 You can play another Pokémon-like game later this year, thanks to the upcoming arrival of Monster Rancher 1 &amp; 2 DX, the remaster of the retro monster collecting games from Koei Tecmo. The collection bundles Monster Rancher (1997) and Monster Rancher 2 (1999), and will launch Dec. 9 on Nintendo Switch, Windows PC via Steam, and iOS, Koei Tecmo announced Thursday.
In the Monster Rancher games, players raise monsters and train them to compete against other creatures in combat and tournaments, just like in Pokémon. The original Monster Rancher launched with a fun gimmick where players could use physical CDs to unlock monsters in the game, with each CD corresponding to a monster. 
Most people don’t use CDs anymore, but the developers found a way to rework the feature into their modern version of the game. In Monster Rancher 1 &amp; 2 DX, you’ll be able to search a database to find each monster’s desired CD and generate a monster from its data. 


The re-release will include new content that wasn’t in the original Western release, like additional save slots, Freeze slots, and Monster Hall of Fame slots. The newer version will bring a few other improvements to gameplay, as well. Players will now be able to use a memo feature while raising monsters, view rankings from random battles, and use a high-speed mode to play through the game faster. 
The Monster Rancher reboots are but a few of the many Pokémon-likes that have been announced or released in recent years. There’s Temtem, a hardcore MMO version of Pokémon released in 2020, and Palword, a game that takes the concept of raising cute monsters and turns it into a brutal survival game, which is due sometime in 2022. Or also, you could just play one of the many actual Pokémon games that are slated to be released in the next few months, like Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl or Pokémon Legends: Arceus.</span>

                    <span>Hi folks. I am taking the rest of August off to spend some time with my family near the ocean. I might extend that through Labor Day weekend, who knows? After hitting it hard here during the first year of the pandemic1 — especially in the first several months — I’ve slowed up a bit this summer to give myself some space to recuperate and reconnect with other areas of my life. That’s been nice &amp; necessary and I’m thankful to have a work situation that allows me to do that, but I plan to be back here in September with a renewed vigor. I hope you have a nice rest of your summer (or winter — I see you southern hemisphere) and I’ll see you back here soon. Stay safe, everyone.

“The first year of the pandemic” — even just writing that tightens the chest.↩

                    <span>It may seem like sometimes that with the pandemic, we’re back to square one. With the much more contagious Delta variant in play and an increasing number of breakthrough infections, the efficacy of these vaccines that we thought were amazing maybe aren’t? (Or maybe we just need to readjust our expectations?) But in terms of what these vaccines were specifically developed for — reducing &amp; preventing severe disease and death — they are still very much doing their job. Just take a look at this graph from a White House Covid-19 press briefing yesterday:

Even with Delta endemic in the country, the vaccines are providing extraordinary protection against infections severe enough to land folks in the hospital. In a recent CDC study of infections and hospitalizations in Los Angeles County, they report that on July 25, the hospitalization rate of unvaccinated people was 29.2 times that of fully vaccinated persons. 29 times the protection is astounding for a medical intervention. These vaccines work, we’re lucky to have them, and we need to get as many people worldwide as we can vaccinated as quickly as we can. Period.

                    <span>Apple CEO Tim Cook this morning attended a cybersecurity meeting with U.S. Joe Biden and executives from other tech companies like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon.





Following the summit, the White House said that the companies in attendance pledged their help to bolster U.S. cybersecurity efforts, with Apple planning to develop a program to make security improvements across its technology supply chain (via Bloomberg and CNBC).



Apple will work with suppliers to adopt multi-factor authentication, security training, and incident response in an effort to improve security.



Google plans to invest $10 billion over five years to strengthen cybersecurity, and it plans to train 100,000 Americans in technical fields through its Career Certificate Program. Microsoft pledged $20 billion over five years to provide more advanced security tools and will invest $150 million to help government agencies upgrade their security systems.



IBM plans to train more than 150,000 people in cybersecurity skills across three years, and it announced a new data storage solution for critical infrastructure companies. Amazon Web Services plans to give account holders free multi-factor authentication devices to improve security, and it will also offer Security Awareness Training.



During the meeting, President Joe Biden asked tech executives to help improve cybersecurity for critical infrastructure and economy, urging them to train up a larger cybersecurity workforce and to provide improvements to cybersecurity in their sectors.

                    <span>iOS 15 didn&#x27;t focus heavily on improvements to HomeKit and the Home app, but there are some notable features like expanded HomeKit Secure Video support and new Siri functionality.





This guide highlights all of the features that are new to ‌HomeKit‌ in the ‌iOS 15‌ and iPadOS 15 updates.



HomeKit Secure Video


‌iOS 15‌ introduces a new iCloud+ service that offers privacy-based features like ‌iCloud‌ Private Relay and Hide My Email, but the feature also comes with ‌HomeKit Secure Video‌ improvements.





With ‌iCloud‌+, Apple is increasing the number of ‌HomeKit Secure Video‌ cameras supported with each ‌iCloud‌ plan. There have been no changes to ‌iCloud‌ plans and all ‌iCloud‌ plans are now ‌iCloud‌+ plans, but more camera footage can be stored.

                    <span>When iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 launch this fall, iCloud Private Relay will be included, but Apple plans to provide the features as a public beta rather than a finalized addition.





According to Apple&#x27;s release notes for the seventh beta of ‌iOS 15‌, ‌iCloud‌ Private Relay is being released as a public beta to allow Apple to &quot;gather additional feedback and improve website compatibility&quot; before the official launch of the feature.



So when ‌iOS 15‌ and the other updates are released, ‌iCloud‌ Private Relay will be available for customers to use, but it will officially be usable in a beta capacity.



In the latest ‌iOS 15‌ and ‌iPadOS 15‌ betas, ‌iCloud‌ Private Relay is now listed as a feature that&#x27;s in beta, with Apple providing the following information: &quot;Private Relay is cur…</span>

iOS 15 is a major update that introduces a slew of new features focused on cutting down on distractions and spending more time with friends and family.

                    <span>Apple today seeded the seventh beta of the upcoming watchOS 8 update to developers for testing purposes, with the update coming one week after Apple released the sixth watchOS 8 beta.





To install ‌‌watchOS 8‌‌, developers will need to download the configuration profile from the Apple Developer Center. Once installed, ‌‌watchOS 8‌‌ can be downloaded through the dedicated Apple Watch app on the iPhone by going to General &gt; Software update.



To update to new software, an Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery life, it must be placed on the charger, and it needs to be in range of the ‌‌iPhone‌‌. It&#x27;s not recommended to install ‌‌watchOS 8‌‌ on a main Apple Watch as the software may be unstable at this early date.

Developers can download the new tvOS 15 beta by downloading a profile onto the ‌Apple TV‌ using Xcode.



Apple shared little about tvOS 15 when it was unveiled, but there are some new features that are coming to the operating system. SharePlay, a FaceTime feature that lets multiple users watch TV shows or movies together, will integrate with tvOS, and there&#x27;s a new &quot;For All of You&quot; recommendation engine that suggests shows everyone might enjoy.



A Shared With You section also displays movies and shows that were shared with you through the Messages app so you remember to check them out. When paired with AirPods Pro or AirPods Max, the ‌Apple TV‌ supports Spatial audio for a theater-like surround sound experience, and there&#x27;s a new feature for automatically connecting your AirPods through Smart ‌AirPods‌ routing.



Hey Siri commands can be used to launch Apple TV+ shows, and two HomePod mini speakers can be paired with the ‌Apple TV‌ 4K for stereo sound. If you have HomeKit cameras, you can also now view multiple cameras at the same time on the ‌Apple TV‌.

                    <span>The non-profit watchdog group Campaign for Accountability today released a report revealing &quot;major weaknesses&quot; in Apple&#x27;s App Store child safety measures that allow minors to easily access adult content such as pornography and gambling.





As part of its Tech Transparency Project, the watchdog group said it set up an Apple ID for a fictitious 14-year-old user and used it to download and test 75 apps in the App Store across several adult-oriented genres: dating, hookups, online chat, and casino/gambling. Despite all of these apps being designated as 17+ on the App Store, the investigation found the underage user could easily evade the apps&#x27; age restrictions.



Among the findings presented included a dating app that presented pornography before asking the user&#x27;s age, adult chat …</span>

&quot;The Changeling&quot; is described as a &quot;fairytale for grown-ups&quot; that&#x27;s part horror story, part parenthood fable, and a &quot;perilous odyssey through a New York City you didn&#x27;t know existed.&quot;



The book&#x27;s main character, Apollo Kagwa, is an antiquarian book dealer who is beginning to settle into his new life as a devoted father when his wife Emma begins acting strangely and eventually disappears. He meets a mysterious stranger who provides him with information about Emma&#x27;s whereabouts and embarks on a quest to find her.



The series will be written and adapted by Kelly Marcel, known for &quot;Cruella&quot; and &quot;Venom.&quot; Melina Matsoukas, known for &quot;Insecure,&quot; is set to direct.

                    <span>Apple today announced that it is celebrating 105 years of America&#x27;s national parks with a series of initiatives that will help customers learn more about them.




&quot;With every passing year, our national parks only become more precious,&quot; said Tim Cook, Apple&#x27;s CEO. &quot;We&#x27;re honored to play a small role in helping even more people explore the parks, learn about their history, and renew their love and appreciation for the planet we share.&quot;
As was announced earlier this week, Apple is donating $10 to the National Park Foundation for each purchase made with Apple Pay on Apple.com. The promotion will last through August 29, but it is limited to the first 100,000 transactions with a $10 minimum purchase.

                    <span>Apple is currently testing new Face ID hardware that could allow users to unlock their iPhone while wearing a mask or foggy glasses, according to leaker Jon Prosser.





Render of the upgraded Face ID prototype case.




Via his website FrontPageTech.com, Prosser explained that Apple is testing more advanced Face ID hardware using a case that fits snugly around an iPhone 12. The case allows the ‌iPhone‌ to bypass its built-in Face ID system to use that of the case instead.



Prosser believes that the prototype Face ID array matches the exact layout depicted in CAD files of the iPhone 13 from earlier this year. This is because the prototype Face ID hardware in the case is considerably narrower than that of the ‌iPhone 12‌, which would line up with the slimmer notch that is e…</span>

                    <span>Starting with iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey, users with a paid iCloud+ storage plan can personalize their iCloud email address with a custom domain name, such as johnny@appleseed.com, and the feature is now available in beta.





iCloud+ subscribers interested in setting up a custom email domain can visit the beta.icloud.com website, select &quot;Account Settings&quot; under their name, and select &quot;Manage&quot; under &quot;Custom Email Domain.&quot; Users can send and receive email with up to five custom domains, while family members can each have up to three email addresses per domain.



After entering a custom domain on the iCloud website, users can add email addresses that they currently use with the domain. Users can also create new email addresses after they have finished setting up the domain with iCloud, according to Apple. Note that any custom email addresses must not be in use with another Apple ID.





For those who missed the announcement back at WWDC in June, iCloud+ is Apple&#x27;s new branding for paid iCloud storage combined with new features like iCloud Private Relay and Hide My Email. iCloud+ features are included with iCloud storage plans at no additional cost, with prices remaining set at $0.99 per month for 50GB of storage, $2.99 per month for 200GB of storage, or $9.99 per month for 2TB of storage in the United States.



The ability to use a custom email address for iCloud is not to be confused with Hide My Email, a separate iCloud+ feature that allows users to create unique, random email addresses that forward to their personal inbox so they can send and receive email without having to share their real email address.

Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.



iPhone 12 mini


To start, you can get Apple&#x27;s 64GB iPhone 12 mini from T-Mobile for $429.99, down from $729.99. This $300 off discount is only available when you select T-Mobile as a carrier, and it&#x27;s a one-time payment that requires activation with T-Mobile at purchase.




$300 OFF
64GB iPhone 12 mini for $429.99





You can save $300 on most models of the iPhone 12 mini: the 128GB is available for $479.99, and the 256GB is available for $579.99. Additionally, Best Buy is offering $75 off some iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max models. Note that all of these savings are seen only under T-Mobile on Best Buy.



iPad mini 5


Best Buy also has $100 off Apple&#x27;s iPad mini 5, starting at $299.99 for 64GB Wi-Fi, down from $399.99. You can also get the 256GB Wi-Fi model for $449.99, down from $549.99.




$100 OFF
64GB iPad mini 5 for $299.99





Both sales represent matches for the previous all-time low prices on the iPad mini 5. We&#x27;re expecting a refresh of the iPad mini lineup sometime this fall, which is likely the reason why we&#x27;re now seeing frequent discounts on the 2019 model.

                    <span>Zoom today announced the latest version of its popular video conferencing app, and one of the key new features is gesture recognition on the iPad, enabling users to use visual gestures to automatically use a corresponding meeting reaction.





The feature currently supports the &quot;Raise Hand&quot; and &quot;Thumbs Up&quot; reactions. If you raise your hand or give a thumbs up in real life, a hand or thumbs up icon will automatically appear alongside your video feed in a Zoom meeting. A raised hand typically indicates that you have a question and would like to be unmuted to speak.



Zoom has also received a new Focus Mode, chat sidebar enhancements, and several other new features, as outlined in the full release notes.



iPad and iPhone users can update to the latest version of Zoom through the App Store.

                    <span>Apple is preparing to open its first retail store in the Chinese province of Hunan, according to a new official webpage on the company&#x27;s website, as well as images shared on Twitter.





The official webpage offers no date for when the store will launch; however, its opening could be relatively close given the store is plastered with marketing material in anticipation. Apple is advertising the store with the following tagline [translated]:

The first law to open your mind is that there is no law. In Changsha, it is a great truth not to set limits for Reiki. Apple Changsha welcomes all kinds of whimsical ideas to let go of their hands and feet and break out of their own world.
On its website, Apple offers wallpapers for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac to celebrate the store&#x27;s opening. The new store will be the first retail store for the Hunan province.

                    <span>Apple today shared a new &quot;Today at Apple&quot; session on YouTube, exploring how to shoot expressive pet portrait photos, with the help of photographer Sophie Gamand and Jahmyra from Today at Apple.








The playful session encourages participants to use their iPhone at the correct height, tune into the pet&#x27;s personality, and take a look at showcase pet portraits for inspiration and top takeaways.



Apple says its free Today at Apple sessions are meant to inspire hands-on creativity in photography, art, design, video, coding, music, and more using Apple products and accessories like the ‌‌iPhone‌‌, iPad, Mac, and Apple Pencil. Initially hosted exclusively at Apple Stores, the sessions started to be offered online during the global health crisis, and Apple also started uploading sessions to YouTube last month.



This is the fifth Today at Apple session uploaded to YouTube, with previous sessions looking at drawing yourself as a &quot;Peanuts&quot; character in the Pages app using an ‌‌iPad‌‌ and ‌‌Apple Pencil‌‌, shooting and editing &quot;otherworldly&quot; photos with Night Mode, creating looped videos in the Clips app, and shooting portrait photos.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/25/youtube-premium-users-ios-picture-in-picture/">

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Google has rolled out picture-in-picture support as an &quot;experimental&quot; feature for YouTube premium subscribers, allowing them to watch video in a small window when the app is closed.





If you&#x27;re a premium YouTube subscriber looking to try out picture-in-picture, follow these steps: 


Launch a web browser and sign into your YouTube account at YouTube.com.

Navigate to www.youtube.com/new.


Scroll down to &quot;Picture-in-picture on iOS&quot;.


Click &quot;Try it out.&quot;
Now, when you&#x27;re in the YouTube app watching a video, return to your Home Screen by swiping up/pressing the Home button, and the picture-in-picture mini player will pop up. Google notes that locking your phone when watching in picture-in-picture mode will pause the video, but you can resume it by using the Lock Screen media controls.





Google in June announced that picture-in-picture support would be rolling out to both premium and non-paying YouTube app users in the U.S., but some people outside the U.S. have been able to get the experimental feature working, so it could be globally available. 


How to Use Picture in Picture Mode on iPhone


However, Google says the feature is only available until October 31. The company doesn&#x27;t explain what happens after that, but hopefully that&#x27;s when support rolls out to both paying subscribers and non-paying users, as originally promised. Whether it will still be available globally outside of its &quot;experimental&quot; context remains to be seen, though.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/25/iphone-13-launch-sept-17-chinese-report/">

                    <span>Apple may be planning to launch the iPhone 13 on Friday, September 17 and third-generation AirPods on Thursday, September 30, according to an image of an e-commerce app discovered by Chinese language site IT Home.





The screenshot, originally posted by Weibo account @PandaIsBald, suggests all four ‌iPhone 13‌ models will go on sale on September 17, followed by the ‌AirPods‌ 3 on September 30.



Apart from the image, which could be easily faked, IT Home offers no other information to back up the claim, and the website has shared screenshots in the past that turned out to be inaccurate, so the above information should be taken with a hefty dose of salt. 



That said, with Apple returning to its traditional September launch timeline, the above dates could easily turn out to be correct. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives has suggested the iPhone will launch in the third week of September, which would be the week of September 13 to 17. Based on past launch events, September 7, September 14, and September 21 are all likely event dates where we could see the new ‌iPhone‌ models unveiled.



The new ‌iPhone 13‌ models will focus heavily on camera capabilities, including ProRes and portrait mode for videos. The new handsets will also include a smaller notch, larger batteries, and improved performance. Apple&#x27;s third-generation ‌AirPods‌ are expected to have a form factor similar to the AirPods Pro, featuring a new case, a shorter stem, and perhaps replaceable ear tips.

                    <span>An Alaska Airlines flight was evacuated on Monday night after a smartphone on the plane caught fire, reports The Seattle Times (via The Verge). A spokesperson for the Port of Seattle said that the device that was burned was a Samsung Galaxy A21. 





In an email to The Seattle Times, the Port of Seattle spokesperson said that the phone was &quot;burned beyond recognition,&quot; but the passenger who owned the device provided details on the model. &quot;We could not confirm it by looking at the remains of the device,&quot; said the spokesperson.



The flight crew extinguished the fire with a battery containment bag, but smoke forced the deployment of the evacuation slides. The smartphone did not catch fire until the flight had landed at the Seattle-Tacoma airport. 128 passengers and six crew member…</span>

Most of us live in cities where we see the casualties of Profit. While pharmaceutical companies happily pay fines and settlements and their stock prices skyrocket, every day more than […]

                    <span>Jason Snell, writing at Six Colors:
Apple, in its iOS 15 beta 7 release notes:
iCloud Private Relay will be released as a public beta to gather additional feedback and improve website compatibility.
[…] It seems like Apple’s slowing this roll-out down, at least in part, because there are lingering compatibility issues with some websites—most notably sites that are displaying the wrong region-specific content, or getting confused when signing in a user. There are some fairly easy remedies web developers can do to make these issues go away, but getting the web to adjust to any new feature takes time, and Apple appears to have erred on the side of caution.
This is what happens in mid-to-late August each year: some features announced at WWDC get postponed for subsequent dot releases throughout…</span>

                    <span>Christine Clarridge, reporting for The Seattle Times:
A passenger’s cellphone caught on fire inside the cabin of an Alaska Airlines flight from New Orleans to Seattle that had landed at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport Monday evening. It was a Samsung Galaxy A21, according to Perry Cooper, a spokesman for the Port of Seattle.
“After much digging, I can tell you that the phone was burned beyond recognition,” Cooper said in an email. “However, during an interview with one of our Port of Seattle Police officers, the passenger volunteered the phone was a Samsung Galaxy A21. Again, we could not confirm it by looking at the remains of the device.”
The crew on Flight 751 extinguished the fire with a battery containment bag, but smoke forced the deployment of evacuation slides, a spokesperson for Alaska Airlines told KOMO-TV.
Good thing no one was hurt. Bad day for Samsung PR. Hope we find out more about exactly how this happened.

Chuck is really changing over the roster, eh?
 The Philadelphia Flyers will just not stop adding some damn dudes to this damn roster!
Announced by the team on Wednesday, they have signed free agent center Derick Brassard to a one-year, $825,000 deal.
OFFICIAL: We&#x27;ve signed forward Derick Brassard to a one-year deal!  ✍️ https://t.co/Qd1YwAFjqA
— Philadelphia Flyers (@NHLFlyers) August 25, 2021



Brassard, 33, is a veteran’s veteran forward, having appeared in a total of 905 NHL games for eight(!) different organizations. Now his ninth in Philadelphia, Brassard is reunited with his former head coach during his time as a member of the New York Rangers, Alain Vigneault. The center played three seasons under Vigneault from the 2013-14 season to his 2015-16 …</span>

He led the team in a major statistical category at just 20 years old.
 Out of every player in the Flyers’ forward group, Joel Farabee took the biggest step forward in 2020-21, and it isn’t even close.



If one considers Farabee’s rookie season a success, comparatively in a year devoid of standout performances, his sophomore season is a highlight. At just twenty years old, playing in the top six, it appears that only the sky is the limit for the Syracuse native. 
By The Numbers


As you can see, Farabee scored 20 goals, which led the Flyers! In fact, he led the NHL in goals among players aged 22 or younger. That’s pretty impressive considering the likes of Brady Tkachuk, Patrik Laine, Martin Necas all populate that list. Farabee is right there a…</span>

It took a minute, but the former first-round pick has established himself firmly as part of the Flyers’ core.
 Teams that win the Stanley Cup always tend to have depth players that prove to be integral along the way, whether or it be during the regular to propel the club in or to get over the hump in the postseason — the Flyers are hoping on Scott Laughton being one of them at some point. 
The 20th overall pick back in the 2012 NHL Entry Draft has had quite the journey towards a regular role in the league, and has put in the work over the years in order to do it. A prime example being the 2016-17 season in which Laughton was essentially told to spend the year in the American Hockey League and remake his game — to focus on transforming hi…</span>

It’s dark and I’m scared of the Philadelphia Flyers Aquaman Jason Momoa.
 It’s raining outside. Dim spotlights cast from street lamps draw circles on the wet pavement of a dark road, leading like markers all the way up to the abandoned house. No one lives there anymore, not since the accident that destroyed lives, families, and an entire town. All that is left is creaking doors and battered floorboards covered in dust.
You step closer to the house. There is a figure. The slow pendulum of light behind it, swaying back and forth, casting shadows across the broken-down porch that only the grimiest of rats call home. Light bouncing through the street and onto your face. Giving you just enough ability to see what is standing in the …</span>

Season 0 includes a new battle pass and a new map
 Splitgate has technically been out for over two years, but its recent move onto console and into open beta has revived the free-to-play shooter, raising its profile on Twitch and elsewhere. In fact, two years after its early access release it’s finally getting new seasons of content. The first season, dubbed season 0, has already started and was announced on Wednesday during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live presentation.  
Splitgate has had battle passes before, but this new opt-in is full of cosmetic items for players to unlock. It’s accompanied by a new patch, which contains with a few much needed balance and quality-of-life tweaks. One thing players will likely notice right away about the cosmetics in that they’r…</span>

The pinnacle PvP mode is getting a major rework
 Destiny’s pinnacle multiplayer experience, Trials, has seen some major issues in Destiny 2. But on Sept. 10, Bungie will upgrade the game mode with a host of changes.
First, Trials of the Osiris won’t be available every weekend anymore. The mode won’t open during the first week of new seasons or before world first raid races. And Trials won’t launch at all on Iron Banner weeks. 
Bungie’s biggest change for the game mode is to matchmaking. Players won’t need to have a three-player team ready in orbit before launching the activity. Starting Sept. 10, players can matchmake with other groups. Bungie will add a solos only “freelance” playlist in the future, which will only match solo players together, just like Iron Banner’…</span>

Combat Evolved
 Splitgate, the new in-beta free-to-play arena shooter from 1047 Games, is what would happen if you stuck Halo 3 and Portal in a blender. The result is a game where no single mechanic feels completely unique, but they all mix together into a fantastic multiplayer offering, and a much-needed update for a very tired genre. 



Splitgate was originally released in early access in 2019 as a fairly barebones version of the game that never really caught on. However, after two years of updates from 1047 Games, the game is now in open beta on PC and consoles. It’s significantly improved, which players have certainly seemed to notice. And with the recent announcement of its first real content season, it seems like Splitgate is going to stick around this ti…</span>

New Saints in a new city return the crime-spree franchise to its 15-year-old origins
 It should come as no surprise that the next Saints Row, launching in February, is a complete reboot of Volition’s open-world crime spree franchise. As fun as it was to make, the studio realized they may have painted themselves into a narrative corner, eight years after the thoroughly surreal Saints Row 4 widened the gangland canon to include an alien invasion, Vice President Keith David, the Dubstep Gun, and the author Jane Austen.
“When we would talk about Saints Row 4, we would talk about how you were coming from the crack house, to the penthouse, to the White House,” Jim Boone, Volition’s chief creative o…</span>

Open beta on PC follows several delays
 Amazon’s New World has been delayed multiple times since 2020, but it appears the Sept. 28 release date announced in August will be the one that sticks. During Gamescom’s Opening Night Live broadcast, Amazon announced the open beta will run Sept. 9-12.
A closed beta was held back in July. Delays for New World began in April 2020, following problems caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. New World is an MMO, for Windows PC, where players colonize a fictional continent somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. Players in groups of 50 or so can battle one another in massive fights.
Amazon Game Studios first announced the game in 2016 at TwitchCon, alongside two other PC games: Breakaway, which was canceled, and Crucible, which was released and then un-released before development was eventually stopped.
Gamescom is ongoing this week, though Microsoft held a pre-show event on Tuesday, where it made announcements regarding Forza Horizon 5, Microsoft Flight Simulator, Xbox Game Pass, and, of course, trebuchets.</span>

King Louie, Baloo, Mowgli, and Shere Khan will get their own bean skins
 Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout showed up at Tuesday’s Gamescom: Opening Night Live event and revealed a bizarre crossover: Disney&#x27;s The Jungle Book skins are coming to Fall Guys. But these skins aren’t modeled after the modern adaptations, they’re pulled, hauntingly, from the animated movie of your childhood. 
Starting in early September, players can pick up skins based on Mowgli, Shere Khan, Baloo, and King Louie. Like all bean skins, The Jungle Book crossover skins feature a top and bottom, with the top featuring full versions of the animated character’s heads. 
King Louie will get his own in-game event from Sept. 3-12 — it’s currently unclear if this event will add any new maps next month. The other The Jungle Book skins will have different availability, which Mediatonic will reveal in a follow-up blog.
The Jungle Book inclusion is all part of Fall Guys season 5’s jungle theme, which launched in July. Players can begin dressing their beans as these iconic characters in just a few weeks.</span>

Up to four players can be terrified at the same time
 Outlast Trials, the third entry in the bloody first-person survival horror game from the team at Red Barrels, revealed its first gameplay trailer on Wednesday. It arrived as part of the Gamescom Opening Night Live streaming event by Geoff Keighley.
The original Outlast was a PlayStation 4 exclusive released in 2013. Its success led to a sequel, Outlast 2, released in 2017. Red Barrels is still in control of the franchise, and has an intimidating new wrinkle for dedicated fans; cooperative multiplayer for up to four players.

“Set in the height of the Cold War era, players take on the role of test subjects abducted by the shadowy Murkoff Corporation,” reads the game’s official description. “Imprisoned in a secret Murkoff facility, players will be thrust into a series of physical and mental ordeals, tormented by iconic characters, and challenged alone or in teams to survive with their sanity intact.”
No release date was announced, and no platforms were mentioned either. You can find out more on the game’s official website.</span>

 The co-creator of Sword &amp; Sworcery, Superbrothers, announced a release date and showed a new trailer for their sci-fi game, Jett: The Far Shore during Gamescom: Opening Night Live on Wednesday. 
Jett: The Far Shore will come to PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Windows PC via the Epic Games Store on Oct. 5. Superbrothers is creating the game in partnership with Pine Scented, and Scntfc is making the score for the game. Pre-orders are going live today. 
Jett: The Far Shore was originally announced in June 2020. Since then, the studio has said that the game would be delayed to 2021. Now we know when it’ll come this fall. 
The game looks like a chilled out space exploration game. You play as Mei, a researcher who is part of a group of aviator scientists who embark on an interstellar trip and arrive on an ocean planet. New footage showed that you’ll be doing plenty of cruising around in your space ship, as well as checking out the planet on foot.</span>

Biking, boarding, and wingsuiting available on PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC
 Riders Republic’s beta is now open to the public on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. The beta runs from Wednesday, Aug. 25 until Saturday, Aug. 28.
Ubisoft presented the game with a two-minute trailer introducing players to Riders Republic, which resembles a Forza Horizon-style racing festival with X-Games-like biking, snowboarding, and wingsuit flying events.
Riders Republic launches Oct. 28, 2021 on the beta platforms, as well as on Google Stadia and Amazon Luna. It was first revealed in September 2020, and originally due in February, but was delayed to this fall in order to deliver “the best fun-fueled experience to our players,” Ubisoft Annecy said at the time. The studio is also the team behind Steep, the 2016 skiing and snowboarding video game.
In Riders Republic, players will ski, snowboard, bike, and glide in “an extreme sports fantasyland” set in virtual versions of U.S. national parks, including Bryce Canyon, Yosemite Valley, Sequoia, Zion, and Mammoth Mountain.</span>

She even does a mic drop
 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge, the new retro beat-’em-up inspired by the classic Konami arcade games, will of course feature Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello on its playable roster. At Gamescom 2021 on Wednesday, developer Tribute Games and publisher Dotemu revealed that intrepid reporter April O’Neil will also kick ass in Shredder’s Revenge.
April will wield her microphone and television camera as deadly weapons in battles against Foot soldiers, but she’s also a capable hand-to-hand martial artist. Some of April’s moves look inspired by another female fighter, Chun-li from Street Fighter and her tenshokyaku rising air kick. “Her agility and far-reaching slide kicks help her close in on targets quickly, and she once again proves the turtles can rely on her unwavering support, even through slices of pizza,” Dotemu said in an official description.
A new trailer for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge also shows off team moves — watch as Leonardo picks April up and turns her into a deadly bowling ball — and the ability to revive teammates with (what else?) a slice of pizza.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge is coming to Nintendo Switch and PC in 2022.</span>

                    <span>Remember Scanwiches? There was even a book version in 2011 and Helen Rosner wrote about the site for Saveur.
To create an image, he simply places half a sandwich on the glass of his Epson V700 scanner. “There’s not a lot of trickery,” says Chonko, who will release a book based on the site in November, with Powerhouse Books. “I try to stay true to the heart and soul of the sandwich. That’s a lofty way to think about it. But then I eat it for lunch.”


The site has stopped publishing new scans, but it’s still good, still delicious. And is a hot dog a scanwich? Apparently so.

                    <span>Only 34 paintings by Dutch master Johannes Vermeer, art history’s foremost painter of Side Views of People Doing Things Near Windows,  have been known to survive to the present day, so when one of them is restored, it’s a big deal. The Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister in Dresden shared the first image of the completed restoration of Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window — and you might notice a pretty big change on the wall behind the girl.
The painting has been in the museum’s collection for more than 250 years and the hidden Cupid had been known about since an x-ray in 1979 and infrared reflectography in 2009. It had been assumed that the artist himself had altered the composition by covering over the painting of Cupid.
But when a major restoration project began in May 2017, conservators discovered that the paint on the wall in the background of the painting, covering the naked Cupid, had in fact been added by another person. When layers of varnish from the 19th century began to be removed from the painting, the conservators discovered that the “solubility properties” of the paint in the central section of the wall were different to those elsewhere in the painting.
Following further investigations, including tests in an archaeometry laboratory, it was discovered that layers of binding agent and a layer of dirt existed between the image of Cupid and the overpainting. The conservators concluded that several decades would have passed between the completion of one layer and the addition of the next and therefore concluded that Vermeer could not have painted over the Cupid himself.


There is a certain aesthetic amenity to the bare wall in the altered version but maaaybe the original Cupid lends the painting some figurative meaning?

                    <span>By making public health central to their health care system, Costa Rica has achieved a higher life expectancy than the US for a fraction of the cost. How did they do it? The New Yorker’s Atul Gawande investigates.
Life expectancy tends to track national income closely. Costa Rica has emerged as an exception. Searching a newer section of the cemetery that afternoon, I found only one grave for a child. Across all age cohorts, the country’s increase in health has far outpaced its increase in wealth. Although Costa Rica’s per-capita income is a sixth that of the United States — and its per-capita health-care costs are a fraction of ours — life expectancy there is approaching eighty-one years. In the United States, life expectancy peaked at just under seventy-nine years, in 2014, and has declin…</span>

Hao Kuo Chi collected more than 620,000 private photos and videos by impersonating Apple customer support staff and sending out emails to trick his victims into providing Apple IDs and passwords. Chi used social engineering and phishing schemes to coerce his victims, and he did not breach Apple&#x27;s ‌iCloud‌ protections.



Chi accessed photos and videos from at least 306 victims across the United States, and most of them were young women. Some of the victims were attacked at the request of people that Chi met online after he marketed himself as &quot;icloudripper4you,&quot; a service that could break into ‌iCloud…</span>

                    <span>Hulu this week began implementing HDR, HDR10, HDR10+, and Dolby Vision for some of its original television shows and movies, so Apple TV owners can now watch Hulu content in HDR.





HDR content offers a higher contrast range for more detail, and Hulu TV shows and movies that support HDR content will display an HDR badge on the details page if they are available to stream in HDR.





Hulu&#x27;s HDR content is available on the fifth-generation ‌Apple TV‌ 4K and later, as well as the Chromecast Ultra, Fire TV devices, Roku devices, and Vizio TVs. HDR support is not available on mobile devices at this time.



As noted by CNET, HDR support is limited to Hulu originals, which includes &quot;Handmaid&#x27;s Tale,&quot; &quot;Little Fires Everywhere,&quot; &quot;Nine Perfect Strangers,&quot; &quot;Future Man,&quot; &quot;Castle Rock,&quot; and more.



Hulu appears to be rolling out support for HDR, so not all ‌Apple TV‌ users may see it available immediately.

                    <span>South Korea may soon ban Apple and Google from requiring app developers to use their in-app purchase systems, reports Reuters.





South Korea&#x27;s legislation and judiciary committee is expected to approve an &quot;Anti-Google Law&quot; that amends the existing Telecommunications Business Act. It will require Apple and Google to allow third-party payment methods in their app stores in South Korea, and it will let developers use independent payment systems.



If the amendment is approved by the committee, the National Assembly of South Korea will hold a final vote on Wednesday. Support for the bill has been picking up, and earlier this month, officials in South Korea met with the founder of the Coalition for App Fairness and the senior vice president of Match Group, both vocal anti-Apple cr…</span>

                    <span>With its mid-band 5G network that&#x27;s widely available, T-Mobile has earned the title of fastest U.S. mobile network in 2021, according to testing conducted by PCMag.





Each year, PCMag sends drivers to traverse thousands of miles of the United States. This year, drivers traveled over 10,000 miles and surveyed network speeds in 30 major metro areas and six rural regions to find the fastest carrier. T-Mobile had the fastest 5G speeds in 24 cities and rural areas, while AT&amp;T won out in eight locations and Verizon won in two.



Verizon had the fastest maximum speeds overall, but T-Mobile had the highest average speeds at 162.3 Mb/s, beating out AT&amp;T and Verizon, which came in at 98.2 Mb/s and 93.7 Mb/s, respectively. T-Mobile earned a total speed score of 96, while AT&amp;T received a…</span>

The account sharing the information goes by UnclePan, who has shared information regarding Apple&#x27;s plans in the past. According to a post from the leaker this week, the upcoming Series 7 will be offered in 41mm and 45mm case sizes. 



Up until the Apple Watch Series 4, Apple had offered 38mm and 42mm case sizes.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(8 min)</span>
                    <span>In late April, Spotify began testing a Podcast Subscriptions program as a way for creators to offer paid subscriber-only content to listeners, and today the streaming music service announced this monetization option is now available to all U.S. creators. Spotify said creators can mark episodes as subscriber-only and publish them to Spotify and other platforms through its podcast creation platform Anchor.





Spotify also announced that it plans to expand the Podcast Subscriptions program internationally starting September 15 of this year.



Spotify said its model is built to maximize revenue for creators, who will receive 100% of subscription revenue minus payment processing fees until 2023, when the company plans to implement a 5% fee on subscription revenue.



Two changes are being made to the program to benefit creators: additional pricing tiers for subscription fees and the option to download a list of email addresses for subscribers so creators can further engage with their audiences.



Apple rolled out its own Podcasts Subscriptions feature worldwide in June, with the company receiving 30% of a subscriber&#x27;s revenue in the first year and 15% if they remain subscribed for longer than one year. Creators are also required to enroll in the Apple Podcasters Program for $19.99 per year in order to offer subscriptions.



Benefits of Apple Podcasts Subscriptions for creators include the ability to offer subscriptions for individual shows or for groups of shows through a &quot;channels&quot; feature, the choice to offer fully paid subscriptions or freemium subscriptions with a mix of free and paid episodes, and availability in over 170 countries and regions today. Apple Podcasts Subscriptions also has options for soliciting subscriber email addresses.

                    <span>On this day ten years ago, Steve Jobs resigned as CEO of the company he built and officially named Tim Cook as Apple&#x27;s new head. Two months later, Steve Jobs passed away and the future of Apple lay solely on the shoulders of Tim Cook.





‌Tim Cook‌ took over Apple at a turbulent time when Jobs was battling pancreatic cancer and the company&#x27;s future seemed uncertain. Questions were widespread after ‌Tim Cook‌ took over, including whether Cook would continue in the footsteps of Jobs or create a new vision for the future of Apple.



A day after he became CEO, Cook sent a letter to Apple employees, promising that despite Jobs no longer being at the helm, Apple &quot;is not going to change.&quot; 



The first device that launched with ‌Tim Cook‌ as CEO was the iPhone 4S in 2011, which w…</span>

The leaker shared the information on Twitter, explaining that both of the upcoming MacBook Pro models, expected to come in 14 and 16-inch sizes, will feature the same performance due to having the same &quot;M1X&quot; chip.



Currently, the 16-inch MacBook Pro offers a significant performance improvement over the high-end 13-inch models due to its more powerful Intel chips and better thermals, so bringing the two model sizes to parity could be a major boost for owners of the smaller, more portable model.

With a price tag said to be $179, the Fitbit Charge 5 will be $50 more expensive than the current Charge 4, but there are some obvious hardware changes on the way that have more in common with the Fitbit luxe, not least being a full-color rounded display that traces the curve of the ergonomic wrist strap.



The images suggest the device will have capacitive touch areas on the sides, and according to the leaked video, the Charge 5 will additionally have built-in GPS and ECG sensors, as well as an electrodermal activity (EDA) sensor that claims to track your stress levels.



The EDA sensor plays into the company&#x27;s Daily Readiness Score, which is a subscriber-only Fitbit Premium feature ($10 per month or $80 per year). The score is based on your exercise history, sleep, and heart rate, and is used to recommend what exercise routine you should undertake each day.

Every device purchased comes with a six-month trial of Fitbit Premium, which is clearly competing with Apple Watch and its Apple Fitness+ integration, with guided workouts and programs on offer on top of sleep tools and other health insights.



The Fitbit Charge will be available in at least three colors, and there&#x27;s no word on the specific release date for the fitness tracker-cum-smartwatch, but Google is likely to place it strategically around the launch of the Apple Watch Series 7 that&#x27;s expected to be announced in the next month or so.

                    <span>The ’90s were not the easiest decade for me because my life was full of more downs than ups. The music that saved me from going off the deep end was Trip Hop. The melancholy breakbeats with haunting vocals spoke to me on so many levels and even inspired me to create music of my own. […]

                    <span>In 1980s German Democratic Republic, also known as East Germany, a group of artists who called themselves Autoperforationsartisten, or “self-perforation artists,” decided to undermine the socialist art authorities by putting on strange and disturbing performances. Check out images of their performances below, featuring member artists Else Gabriel, Micha Brendel, Rainer Görß and Via Lewandowsky. The […]

Season of the Lost adds a handful of new Exotics for Guardians
 Another Destiny 2 season is here, and that means more Exotics for Guardians to get their hands on. With Season of the Lost, players can expect the usual seasonal Exotic weapon, one Exotic armor piece per class, and more. Season of the Lost has at least one bonus Exotic quest. 
However, we don’t know everything about the Exotics coming this season. Bungie has officially revealed four through the in-game collection, but it’s hiding one more. Here’s a look at the four Exotics we know about, and everything we know about the fifth. As in past seasons, players can get the new Armor Exotics by soloing Master or Legend Lost Sectors.

No glasses needed for this nifty, forced-perspective rendering
 Some of the greatest games take the novel experiences of real life and translate them into a cunning virtual experience. For example, this train building game by James Vanas is reminiscent of the feeling of holding one of those plastic 3D bookmarks sold in tchotchke tourist shops. As you tilt it, the game moves like a holographic card.

Microsoft offers updates on Forza Horizon 5, Flight Simulator, and more
 Microsoft gave Xbox fans an end-of-summer update at Gamescom 2021 on Tuesday, revealing new details about upcoming games like Forza Horizon 5 and Age of Empires 4, as well as released (or soon-to-be-released) games like Microsoft Flight Simulator and Psychonauts 2. If you didn’t catch the nearly-90-minute stream, we’ve got a quick rundown of what’s new in the world of Xbox and PC gaming.
But before you start scrolling, we’ll set an important expectation: Xbox Game Studios and 343 Industries did not announce a final release date for Halo Infinite at Gamescom. That game is still slated to hit Xbox consoles and PC sometime this holiday season.
The Xbox team will have more to share on Wednesday, Aug. 25, at Gamescom Opening Night Live, the pre-show event hosted by Geoff Keighley. This post will be updated with whatever Microsoft and Xbox Game Studios has left to announced at Gamescom 2021 later this week.</span>

Procedural storytelling meets player narrative in one of the year’s best games
 Wildermyth clicked for me when my greatest warrior’s human head was transformed into the head of a raven. She had just spent an evening sassing a woman cloaked in black, making fun of her mystical ways, and when that woman turned into a flock of crows the next day, my warrior’s life was never the same. She went on to slay a bunch of constructs made from cogwheels and bones by ripping at their armor with her razor-sharp beak. She entered into myth as a part-woman, part-bird, and all-powerful ass-kicking hero who bought the land a hundred years of peace. 



That story wasn’t fully written by the devs of Wildermyth. There is no warrior-bird hero questline in the game. The random…</span>

Age of Empires 4’s memeable siege unit gets some love in ‘Hands on History’
 Trebuchets — “the ultimate medieval siege weapon,” not the sans-serif typeface created by Microsoft — are coming to Age of Empires 4 and players will be able to learn all about them in the game’s “Hands on History” segments,  developers World’s Edge and Relic Entertainment announced at Gamescom 2021 on Tuesday. Adam Isgreen, creative director at World’s Edge, offered a (very) deep dive into the fan-favorite, highly memed trebuchet during Xbox’s Gamescom stream, as a way to teach players about medieval history.


Age of Empires 4 will include 28 unlockable Hands on History videos, each of which was “filmed on location with experts around the world.” In the case of ye olde trebuchet, mechanical engineer Dr. Shini Somara explained how the don’t-call-it-a-catapult works at Warwick Castle in England during a three-minute-long segment shown at Tuesday’s livestream.
World’s Edge and Relic showed off the Age of Empires 4 trebuchet in action in-game last week, in a trailer that offers a short but satisfying burst of projectile lobbing and castle sieging.


They’ve also shown off other weapons of war coming to Age of Empires 4, including the Nest of Bees, which I only learned about today and was crestfallen to discover does not shoot actual bees.
Age of Empires 4 launches on Oct. 28, on Windows PC via Steam and the Windows Store. It will be available for Xbox Game Pass for PC on launch day.</span>

Season of the Lost will lead straight into The Witch Queen
 Destiny 2’s latest season, Season of the Lost, is here, and it’ll need to keep Guardians occupied for the next six months. Season of the Lost is the final season ahead of Destiny 2’s The Witch Queen expansion, which Bungie revealed alongside Season of the Lost on Tuesday. 
For players concerned about a content drought, Season of the Lost promises some major changes to Destiny 2. Players will finally get their hands on cross play, anti cheat, a Trials of Osiris rework, and dozens of key balance changes. All of that also comes with the usual salvo of seasonal content. 
Here’s a look at the content and updates coming in Season of the Lost. For the complete patch notes, scroll down.…</span>

Nothing’s stopping you from driving the Mercedes-AMG One in the jungle, Playground Games says
 Playground Games revealed Forza Horizon 5’s opening sequence of cinematics and gameplay Tuesday afternoon at Xbox’s Gamescom 2021 showcase, highlighting the varied terrain, weather, and biomes players will encounter on the racing game’s wide-open map of Mexico when it launches in November.
“I think our campaign learns a lot from Horizon 4’s campaign,” Mike Brown, Forza Horizon 5’s creative director, told media in a briefing event last week. The sequence shown at Gamescom bridges the ending of Forza Horizon 4 with the beginning of the latest racing festival. “There are all of these things that you can work towards, but in a way that feels more str…</span>

Destiny will finally get a weapon crafting system as well
 Players finally know what to expect with Destiny 2: The Witch Queen, the game’s fourth expansion, thanks to Bungie’s Destiny Showcase on Tuesday. The studio revealed a host of details around the major update, including the addition of weapon crafting and a new weapon type: the Glaive.
The Glaive is a kind of spear or polearm in Destiny 2, with a long, curved blade on the end. It’s the series second bladed melee weapon, after Bungie added swords in The Taken King, but it’s the first melee weapon that keeps Guardians in first-person. Glaives, like swords,  will have melee combos, but unlike swords, they’re energy weapons and don’t sit in the heavy slot. But players can also launch projectiles with them.
The Witch Queen also introduces Destiny 2’s first real weapon crafting system, although Bungie has fiddled with the idea in past seasons like with The Menagerie’s Chalice of Opulence mechanic. Bungie says this new mechanic will let players “craft the perfect roll,” and combine unique mods with advanced stats. It seems like it should allow players to find the weapons they’re looking for more easily.
The studio isn’t revealing much about the system just yet, but it’s the only way players can unlock the new Glaive. Guardians will be able to craft weapons from The Witch Queen at launch, with even more weapons coming later in 2022.
The Witch Queen expansion takes players to meet Savathun — the titular Witch Queen and sister of Oryx from Destiny’s The Taken King expansion. Players will adventure into her Throneworld to discover how Savathun and her brood of Hive began wielding their own Ghosts and the Light powers that come with them.</span>

The power is in your palms
 The Xbox Gamescom presentation on Tuesday showed off indie titles heading to Xbox Games Pass, but one of them stood out from the bunch. Into the Pit is a fast-paced game that pulls off retro graphics and gameplay. It’s Doom, but you’re a wizard casting spells and firing off magical bolts instead of firing a gun. 
In Into the Pit, you play a member of a family of mystics. Your cousin has gone missing, and it probably has something to do with the demonic pit she uncovered in her search for occult power. From there, the player has to run through a roguelite dungeon, mixing and matching runes and spells to become better at killing demons.
Into the Pit is set to release on PC and Xbox One on Oct. 19, which makes it a perfect pre-Halloween experience for those who enjoy old school FPS gameplay. The game will be available on Xbox Game Pass at launch.</span>

Microsoft says Xbox One will be able to stream Xbox Series X games
 Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers can cloud-stream games on both Xbox Series X and Xbox One this holiday season, Microsoft announced Tuesday during Gamescom 2021. The expansion will mean Xbox One owners can play Xbox Series X games on their console, provided the title is among Game Pass’ streamable library of more than 100 games.
That’s “will mean” because the ability to stream Series X games to Xbox One — a statement from Microsoft used Microsoft Flight Simulator and The Medium as examples — is “coming in t…</span>

                    <span>You might want to take a deep breath or do a couple of laps around the house before watching this video about a community in the Ozarks with a very low Covid-19 vaccination rate. Here’s a sample. An ICU patient wearing an oxygen mask on why he didn’t get vaccinated:
I’m more of a libertarian and I don’t like being told what I have to do. I’m still not completely 100% sold on the inoculation.


Video narrator:
It was eerie to hear Christopher insist on his individual freedoms even as he struggled to breathe.


Can you hear me screaming all the way from my desk to wherever you are? I don’t like being told what I have to do?! Fucking hell. And this:
There’s no better place to see the impact of this political rhetoric than in the hospital. Only about 50 percent of the staff are vaccinated. None of the unvaccinated staffers were willing to talk.


Absolutely maddening. I want off this ride.

Instead it was a year in limbo: school on stuttering Zoom, school in person and then back home again for quarantine, school all the time and none of the time. No part of it was good, for kids or parents, but most parts of it were safe, and somehow, impossibly, we made it through a full year. It was hell, but we did it. We did it.
Time collapsed and it was summer again, and, briefly, things looked better. We began to dream of normalcy, of trips and jobs and school. But 2021’s hot vax summer only truly delivered on the hot part, as vaccination rates slowed and the Delta variant cut through some …</span>

                    <span>I love this post from the NYPL comparing astronomical drawings by E.L. Trouvelot done in the 1870s to contemporary NASA images.
Trouvelot was a French immigrant to the US in the 1800s, and his job was to create sketches of astronomical observations at Harvard College’s observatory. Building off of this sketch work, Trouvelot decided to do large pastel drawings of “the celestial phenomena as they appear…through the great modern telescopes.”


He made drawings of Saturn, Jupiter, aurora borealis, the Milky Way, and more. Here’s his incredible drawing of sun spots compared to a recent image of the Sun’s surface:


And his drawing of a solar eclipse compared to a recent image:


Check out the post for more examples of Trouvelot’s work.

                    <span>Apple CEO Tim Cook is set to join other tech executives in a cybersecurity meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden next week, reports Bloomberg.





The meeting will focus on the efforts by private companies to improve cybersecurity following a surge in online attacks over the course of the last year, an official familiar with the event told Bloomberg.
The executives could discuss efforts undertaken by critical infrastructure entities, including those in the banking, energy and water utility sectors, to improve cybersecurity and collaborations with the government. The tech executives are likely to discuss how software can drive better security in the supply chain, the senior official said.
The meeting will include Cook and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, with executives from Google, Amazon, IBM, Southern Co., and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co also invited to attend.

                    <span>Facebook is re-adding voice and video calling features to its main Facebook app after moving the features to Messenger back in 2014, reports Bloomberg.





Users in some countries including the United States are now able to make voice or video calls directly from the Facebook app. As of now, Facebook is testing the feature, which is meant to cut down on the number of times that Facebook users need to swap over to the Messenger app.



Messenger and Facebook used to be a single app, but in 2014, Facebook split them into separate apps and removed Messenger functionality from Facebook. Customers were forced to download the Messenger app to send private messages to other Facebook users or to make phone calls using the Facebook platform.

                    <span>Apple appears to be expanding on the native Apple Maps review functionality that it first introduced in iOS 14, allowing ‌Apple Maps‌ users in the United States the option to review places of interest, restaurants, and other locations.





In the ‌Apple Maps‌ app in ‌iOS 14‌ and iOS 15, U.S. users can now see an option to provide a thumbs up or thumbs down for most locations. Tapping on the thumbs up/down icon brings up a secondary interface for providing thumbs up and thumbs down ratings for various categories like products, customer service, food, atmosphere, and more, based on the location being reviewed.



Users also have the option to upload photos of the location to the ‌Apple Maps‌ app to be added to the maps listing.





At the current time, the ‌Apple Maps‌ native rating system is displayed alongside the Yelp ratings that are provided for various locations. Apple may eventually be planning to replace Yelp and TripAdvisor integrations, but will need to build up a database of ratings before that will be possible.



There are no options for written reviews at this time, however, so it is not clear if Apple plans to entirely replace Yelp.



Native rating options in the ‌Apple Maps‌ app appear to be new for users in the United States, but Apple has been testing the feature in other countries like the UK and Australia for some time now. Ratings may also be available in additional countries based on the Ratings and Photos Terms legal site for Maps that was shared on Reddit.

                    <span>Pop star and actress Olivia Rodrigo today released the music video for her song &quot;brutal,&quot; off of her debut album &quot;SOUR&quot;. For the video, Rodrigo partnered up with Apple to create a suite of augmented reality face masks using an iPad Pro.







Alongside the release of the music video, Rodrigo shared a few clips on Instagram that showcased her editing the AR face masks using an ‌iPad Pro‌ and an Apple Pencil. The face masks can be seen throughout the video, and include effects like drooping tears made of fire, rainbow hearts, a robot mask, and much more.








Interscope Records, which is Rodrigo&#x27;s label, has a history of using Apple to promote many of its artists. This includes Lady Gaga and Selena Gomez, both of which had music videos shot on iPhone in recent years, and Billie Eilish, whose documentary &quot;The World&#x27;s A Little Blurry&quot; debuted on Apple TV+ earlier this summer.

                    <span>Upcoming Apple TV+ movie &quot;The Tragedy of Macbeth&quot; is set to premiere at the BFI London Film Festival on the final day of the event, Sunday, October 17.





Apple also plans to offer preview screenings of the film at London Film Festival partner cinemas across the UK.



Written by Joel Coen, &quot;The Tragedy of Macbeth&quot; is set to star Denzel Washington and Frances McDormand. Filmed entirely in black and white, the movie is described as a &quot;bold and fierce adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s classic, a tale of murder, madness, ambition, and wrathful cunning.&quot;



&quot;The Tragedy of Macbeth&quot; is the first film directed by a single Coen brother. Joel Coen and his brother Ethan Coen have been responsible for hit movies that include &quot;The Big Lebowski,&quot; &quot;No Country for Old Men,&quot; &quot;Fargo,&quot; and &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot;



Apple announced that it had acquired the rights to the movie back in May, and the film is being produced by Apple partner A24. Apple has previously worked with A24 on &quot;On the Rocks,&quot; starring Bill Murray and Rashida Jones.



After premiering in theaters, &quot;The Tragedy of Macbeth&quot; will be available on ‌Apple TV+‌, but Apple has not yet provided a date for its availability.

                    <span>Apple has today shared a trailer for the second season of &quot;The Morning Show&quot; and highlighted the impending return of the award-winning Apple Original drama series.






The second season of the show will feature ten episodes, and continues to star Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, who also serve as executive producers. Other returning cast members include Steve Carell, Billy Crudup, Mark Duplass, Nestor Carbonell, Karen Pittman, Bel Powley, Desean Terry, Janina Gavankar, Tom Irwin, and Marcia Gay Harden. 



The Morning Show was one of Apple TV+&#x27;s flagship original shows when the video streaming service launched in late 2019. Apple describes the second season as follows:
Picking up after the explosive events of season one, season two finds &quot;The Morning Show&quot; team emerging from the wreckage of Alex (Aniston) and Bradley&#x27;s (Witherspoon) actions, to a new UBA and a world in flux, where identity is everything and the chasm between who we present as and who we really are comes into play.




The first episode of the second season of The Morning Show will debut on Friday, September 17 exclusively on ‌Apple TV+‌, followed by one new episode weekly, every Friday. The complete first season is available to watch now.

&quot;While we hold the incomparable Jeremy Swift in no ill regard and are honored to be mentioned on the platform that&#x27;s brought us high-quality programming ranging from Mythic Quest season one to Mythic Quest season two, we must insist that you cease and desist from the casting of any doubt regarding our commitment to the club, the fans and the entire Wrexham community,&quot; the letter reads in part.

                    <span>T-Mobile today announced that new and existing Magenta and Magenta MAX customers can receive 12 months of Apple TV+ for free starting this Wednesday, August 25 in the United States. T-Mobile has launched a promotional page with further details.





The offer can even be redeemed by users who already pay for Apple TV+. Once you redeem the offer, your paid Apple TV+ subscription will pause and the free one-year period will begin. Once the free period ends, standard billing will resume. T-Mobile&#x27;s offer can also be stacked with any free trial included with the purchase of a new Apple device.



Magenta, Magenta MAX, and T-Mobile for Business customers can login to the T-Mobile app or my.t-mobile.com and navigate to Rate Plan Details to redeem the offer starting Wednesday. Look for a &quot;one year of Apple TV+ on us&quot; banner. T-Mobile customers still on the Sprint billing system can redeem by visiting T-Mobile&#x27;s promotions page and entering the promo code 2021APPLETVP1 into the redemption field.



Eligible plans for T-Mobile customers include Magenta, Magenta MAX, and other Magenta plans, as well as Business Unlimited Advanced and Business Unlimited Ultimate. The offer extends to select Sprint plans, including Unlimited Plus, Unlimited Premium, and others. 



Apple TV+ is regularly priced at $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year. The streaming service provides access to Apple&#x27;s growing library of original TV shows and films, including the hit comedy series &quot;Ted Lasso&quot; starring Jason Sudeikis.



T-Mobile recently suffered a massive data breach that exposed personal information about nearly 50 million customers.

                    <span>Apple today announced that it will make an unspecified donation to the National Park Foundation for each qualifying Apple Pay purchase at an Apple Store, on Apple.com, or in the Apple Store app in the United States from August 23 through August 29.





The promotion is limited to the first 100,000 transactions and it is subject to a $10 minimum purchase with Apple Pay, according to fine print on Apple&#x27;s website.



This is at least the fifth consecutive year that Apple has ran this promotion in support of the National Park Foundation, the official charitable partner of the National Park Service in the United States. Apple CEO Cook has expressed his appreciation for national parks, and in an interview last year he said that Apple Park has conference rooms named after U.S. national parks, such as the Grand Canyon room near his personal office.



On August 25, all U.S. national parks that charge an entrance fee will offer free admission in celebration of the National Park Service&#x27;s birthday. On August 28, Apple Watch users around the world can earn an Activity Challenge award themed after national parks by completing a hike, walk, run, or wheelchair workout of a mile (1.6km) or longer.

                    <span>Despite having tested and worked on the technology, Apple has decided not to include an under-screen Touch ID sensor with the upcoming iPhone 13, continuing to leave customers with Face ID as the only biometric authentication option for the iPhone.





Apple had been testing ‌Touch ID‌ technology that would have allowed the company to place the sensor under the display on the ‌iPhone‌, allowing users to simply put their finger on the display to authenticate. While Apple regularly tests and researches new ideas and technologies, reports earlier in the year had suggested the company was on track to include ‌Touch ID‌ under the display with the 2021 iPhones.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(8 min)</span>
                    <span>Effective next year, pricing for all commercial plans of Microsoft 365 will be increased as a way to compensate for the &quot;increased value&quot; Microsoft&#x27;s suite of tools has provided to customers over the last ten years, Microsoft has announced.





In a blog post late last week, the company says the new changes are the first time it has substantively increased the price of Office 365 since it launched a decade ago. Microsoft notes some of the ways that Microsoft 365 has grown in prominence over the last year, including that it has added 24 different apps to its suite of tools. 

Since its launch a decade ago, Office 365 has grown to over 300 million commercial paid seats. Along the way, we have continuously re-invested to meet the changing needs of our customers. Four years ago, we introduced Microsoft 365 to bring together the best of Office, Windows, and Enterprise Mobility and Security (EMS). That same year we added Microsoft Teams as the only integrated solution where you can meet, chat, call, collaborate, and automate business processes—right in the flow of work.



In fact, since introducing Microsoft 365 we have added 24 apps to the suites—Microsoft Teams, Power Apps, Power BI, Power Automate, Stream, Planner, Visio, OneDrive, Yammer, and Whiteboard—and have released over 1,400 new features and capabilities in three key areas.
The pricing increases are small, consisting of only $2-$4 hikes, and are as followed:

Microsoft 365 Business Basic (from $5 to $6 per user), Microsoft 365 Business Premium (from $20 to $22), Office 365 E1 (from $8 to $10), Office 365 E3 (from $20 to $23), Office 365 E5 (from $35 to $38), and Microsoft 365 E3 (from $32 to $36).
All of the changes will apply globally on March 1, 2022.

                    <span>When it comes to unrelentingly bleak and suspenseful thrillers, South Korean cinema reigns supreme. Especially when serial killers enter the equation, with a cat and mouse chase that’ll leave all parties irrevocably changed. Kwon Oh-seung‘s debut feature, Midnight, enters the pantheon of breathless thrillers, delivering a propulsive, unpredictable film that’s lighter than most of its ilk […]</span>

                    <span>Jacqueline Howard, reporting for CNN:
The US Food and Drug Administration on Monday granted full approval to the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine for people age 16 and older. This is the first coronavirus vaccine approved by the FDA, and is expected to open the door to more vaccine mandates.
Way more mandates. Mandate vaccinated status for everything. School, air travel, train travel, restaurants, stores. Everything. Get vaccinated or stay home.
The vaccine will be marketed as Comirnaty, the FDA said in its announcement on Monday.
I don’t care what they call it, but that’s a bad name. Looks like someone spilled a drink on the keyboard while trying to type “Cormac McCarthy”.
(Moderna has secured “Spikevax” for their vaccine, an excellent name.)

Get it? Because he’s from Austria? Please laugh.
 After heading to Dallas in free agency in search of winning a Stanley Cup, Michael Raffl leaves behind an interesting legacy after eight seasons as a Flyer. The non-Swiss army knife and longtime bottom six presence initially departed at the trade deadline, heading to Washington in exchange for a fifth round pick in 2021 that became Ty Murchison.



While many would (fairly or unfairly) tag him as a career just-a-guy, it’s important to remember that Raffl was, at one point, a very effective NHLer. Unfortunately for him and fans of the Orange &amp; Black, that wasn’t the case in 2020-21. Let’s look at why.

 *In case you forgot, development camp starts this week! The end of this week, but still. This week. Hockey players, on ice, in Voorhees. [Flyers]
*Big news over the weekend though was the Flyers getting a deal done with Travis Sanheim, without the help of the arbiter. [BSH]
*He got a raise, of course, because that’s how these things work. [Inquirer]
*They also locked up Connor Bunnaman. So that’s cool and good. [BSH]
*We took a look back at Oskar Lindblom’s season which, all things considered, was pretty dang impressive. [BSH]
*And then the other big big news this weekend was Henrik Lundqvist’s announcement that he’ll be calling it a career. [Blueshirt Banter]
*Despite his being a real pain in the butt to play against for his entire career, you have to respect just how good he was. [NBC Sports Philly]
*And finally, if anyone has ever been a lock for the Hall of Fame upon retirement, it’s him. [Sportsnet]</span>

Some say the nerfs don’t go far enough, others wonder why a nerfed Seer is even worth having in the game
 Apex Legends’ latest update got players’ hopes up with news of a nerf to the shooter’s newest character, Seer, but the changes don’t go far enough on the newest Legend’s most disruptive ability.
The nerf takes out both the damage and the half-second, screen-blinding flash that opponents suffer when they’re hit with Seer’s “Focus of Attention” Tactical ability. But it still interrupts enemies who are healing themselves or reviving teammates. So Seer can continue playing havoc with opponents’ last-ditch defensive moves, much as the character has done since being introduced three weeks ago.

Mojang and Xbox Game Studios will bring the game to Valve’s store
 Minecraft Dungeons, the dungeon crawler inspired by Mojang’s classic survival game, is coming to Steam on Sept. 22. 
The base game will be available for purchase for $19.99 and the Ultimate Edition, which includes the base game along with all six DLCs, will cost $39.99. Currently, the Windows PC version game is available for purchase on the Microsoft Store.
Minecraft Dungeons is a top-down action RPG game where you explore procedurally generated dungeons. (Think, Diablo but for kids.) Since its release in May 2020, Mojang and Xbox Game Studios have continued to release DLC that expands on the core game and bring new dungeons to explore. 
Three additional battle passes for the game — the Hero Edition, Hero Pass, and Season Pass — will be discounted from digital sales from Aug. 31 and will only be available in retail stores until stock runs out. Mojang and Xbox Games Studios said in a news release, “Players will still be able to purchase the same DLCs and in-game content, which will be available as part of the Standard Edition (game only) and Ultimate Edition (game and all six DLCs).”
Now, it’ll all come to Steam and give folks another way to purchase the game. Minecraft Dungeons is out now on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.</span>

The alpha will be for PlayStation players only
 The latest Call of Duty won’t be released until November, but PlayStation players will have a chance to check the game out early during a multiplayer alpha for the game’s new Champion Hill mode. Call of Duty: Vanguard’s alpha will begin on Aug. 27 at 1 p.m. ET and end on Aug. 29 at 1 p.m. ET.
The alpha will focus on Vanguard’s new Champion Hill mode, in which duo (2v2) or trio (3v3) squads compete against each other in a round-robin tournament. Each team has individual lives that carry over from match to match, but when your team’s lives hit zero, you’re out. The last team standing wins. 
The mode also features an economy system that’s fairly new to the franchise. Every player in Champion Hill wil…</span>

In exchange, this granted an XP multiplier — unfortunately, I had misread the second half of this mutator. Every 10 to 15 seconds the Drone, a Xenomorph with the ability to pin you down à la the Hunter in Left 4 Dead, appeared and terrorized my squad. It was so ridiculous that it became a running joke until we inevitably failed the mission.

                    <span>A Freudian adventure full of warmth, compassion, and humor
 Psychonauts 2 begins with the camera sweeping over the textured contours of a giant brain. At this scale, the complex organ looks topographical — every curve a hill in the landscape of the mind. The image reminded me of one of the more common editions of Sigmund Freud’s landmark The Interpretation of Dreams. The cover image depicted a pastoral scene of rolling green hills.

                    <span>We&#x27;re rapidly approaching Apple&#x27;s busy product launch season, and rumors are continuing to fly. It sounds like Apple has enough products in the pipeline that it&#x27;ll need to hold multiple virtual events before the end of the year to introduce them all, so get ready for a flurry of activity over the next few months.







Other news this week included a fresh round of betas for iOS 15 and most of the associated operating system updates, reducing the update interval to one week as Apple finalizes things ahead of an expected September public launch. We also saw an interesting story of a &quot;double agent&quot; in the Apple leaker community, confirmation of a never-released &quot;iPhone nano&quot; thanks to an old email from Steve Jobs, and more.

Finally, no more uncertainty.
 After a long, arduous battle over the stipulations of his new contract this offseason, Travis Sanheim finally agreed to a new contract with the Flyers: two years at a $4.675 million AAV. This represents a slight, but not enormous pay raise for Sanheim, which will certainly be a polarizing outcome within the eyes of the fanbase. Still, the price and term is around what most models projected the still-young defender to receive. Evolving-Hockey.com’s contract projections pegged Sanheim at two years for $4.303 million AAV, which isn’t too far off from what the Flyers ended up paying.


Sanheim is coming off of a season where he had awful on-ice results despite solid underlying numbers. Costly mistakes and strong analytics have been staples of the big blue liner’s career in Philadelphia, making him an interesting case for arbitration. Looking at the whole of Sanheim’s work in the NHL within the context of an advanced metrics-driven perspective would likely argue that he’s worth more than the deal he was signed to.

The Flyers now technically have -$643,523 in cap space, but are fine due to the ability to exceed the salary cap by ten percent in the offseason. However, it does put them in a precarious position when it comes to running a 23-man roster as opposed to just 22:
Barring a trade or reworking of the roster, it now looks like the Flyers are going to roll with a 22-man roster to start the year. That&#x27;s the only way they can fit everyone under the $81.5 million cap ceiling, to my eyes. Can&#x27;t fit 23 without moving somebody out.
— Charlie O&#x27;Connor (@charlieo_conn) August 21, 2021



With the season just 55 days away, signing Sanheim solidifies the outlook of the roster heading into 2021-22.</span>

Bungie won’t separate Destiny 2’s two main modes, and it’s starting to create problems
 Since the launch of Destiny 2, Bungie has struggled to maintain the balance between its PvE and PvP communities. The two camps have argued for years about whether Destiny should just be a PvE game or if it truly has room for competitive offerings. In the process, every player has lost out. Every time Bungie tries to make a new addition to the cooperative game, it’s hamstrung by multiplayer balancing — and vice versa.
Bungie’s devotion to both sides of the Destiny coin, while admirable, has resulted in an identity crisis. The studio likely won’t ever separate its PvP Crucible from its PvE cooperative activities. But if anything is clear, it’s that current attempts toward harmony a…</span>

                    <span>Apple in 2020 acquired popular weather app Dark Sky, and in iOS 15 some of those Dark Sky features have been incorporated into the official app. Apple&#x27;s Weather app has received a major design overhaul in ‌iOS 15‌, making it a much better weather resource.





Design Overhaul


The Weather app in ‌iOS 15‌ has an updated design that makes it easier than ever to see the information that you want to know at a glance. The Weather app adopts the card-style interface that&#x27;s also been used for the Settings app, separating different information into sections.





There continues to be a main view with the weather conditions on an hourly basis that you can shift through, and a new 10-day forecast view lets you know what weather you can expect in the future. The updated 10-day foreca…</span>

Tetris Beat features music from a diverse set of artists including Alison Wonderland, GARZA (of Thievery Corporation), Hannah Diamond, Octo Octa, Dauwd, CINTHIE, and more. There are 18 exclusive songs that span the dance, hip hop, and pop genres, with new music set to be introduced each month.

                    <span>An Apple II manual signed by Steve Jobs and Mike Markkula sold for $787,484 at auction this month after garnering 46 bids.





The 196 page manual was addressed to Julian Brewer, the son of Michael Brewer. Michael Brewer negotiated distribution rights for Apple in the UK in 1979, and the manual had a personal message inside. &quot;Julian, your generation is the first to grow up with computers. Go change the world! Steven Jobs, 1980,&quot; read Jobs&#x27; note.
Julian recalls, &quot;I was sitting in my bedroom writing games on my Apple II when Dad called me down to meet some guests. To my amazement it was Steve Jobs and Mike Markkula. I had the manual with me and only later understood how rare it was for Jobs to sign anything, let alone to write an inscription like this. He got on well with Dad, so I feel the inscription was made with care.&quot;
RR Auctions, the site that sold the Apple II manual, also auctioned off other Steve Jobs memorabilia that fetched high prices. A Steve Jobs&#x27; letter that said &quot;I&#x27;m afraid I don&#x27;t sign autographs&quot; sold for $479,939, and a NeXTSTEP software package sold for $210,325.





A functional Apple-1 computer previously owned by Roger Wagner fetched $464,876, which is less than some prior Apple-1 computers have sold for. A signed 128K Macintosh Motherboard sold for $132,049, and an Apple Lisa Computer sold for $94,949.





A copy of Macworld #1 that was signed by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak sold for $201,021, and a leather bomber jacket that was worn by Jobs in the 1983 &quot;middle finger to IBM&quot; photo sold for $66,466.

At the time, T-Mobile said that data from 7.8 million current customers had been compromised, as well as information from 40 million former or potential customers. In an updated statement provided today, T-Mobile says that it has confirmed that data from another 5.3 million postpaid customers was accessed.



Information accessed from these customers included names, addresses, birth dates, phone numbers, IMEIs, and IMSIs. The prior 7.8 million customers also saw their SSN and driver&#x27;s license information stolen.

                    <span>Documents highlighted by The Verge and disclosed as part of the Apple vs. Epic Games trial have revealed that Apple discussed plans for sideloading apps, sought to lock users into its ecosystem using gift cards, attempted to tackle chaos in the App Store review process, and more.





Several of the internal documents related to internal discussions around the possibility of sideloading iPhone apps outside of the ‌App Store‌. Some of these discussions may have gone further than expected, since in 2008, software chief Scott Forstall asked Steve Jobs what text should appear to iOS users when they want to open a sideloaded app. Jobs agreed to the following alert: &quot;Are you sure you want to open the application &#x27;Monkey Ball&#x27; from the developer &#x27;Sega&#x27;?&quot;

Apple has begun promoting and posting Today at Apple sessions on YouTube due to the global health crisis. The company was planning to bring back its session to its in-person retail stores at the end of this month; however, it has since decided differently due to the health crisis. The sessions cover photography, art, design, video, coding, music, and more using Apple products and accessories like the ‌‌iPhone‌‌, iPad, Mac, and Apple Pencil.

Thanks to the completely reworked engine, DaVinci Resolve 17.3 can work up to 3 times faster on Apple Mac models with the M1 chip, according to the company. The speed increase should make playback, editing, and grading of 4K and 8K projects faster using the software. 



The new processing engine also uses tile based rendering, which can give users on notebooks up to 30% longer battery when working in DaVinci Resolve.

Apple has multiple new products in store for release this fall, ranging from the iPhone 13, Apple Watch Series 7, third-generation AirPods, an updated iPad mini, a new baseline iPad, and of course, the highly anticipated redesigned 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pros.

                    <span>In a long and extensive interview with the Australian Financial Review, Apple CEO Tim Cook discussed many topics, from Apple&#x27;s core values on privacy, the importance of user trust, his morning routine, App Store regulation, and more.





The interview, conducted in July, is in celebration of the Financial Review&#x27;s 70th anniversary. Cook begins the interview by sharing his morning routine, noting he likes to read emails from customers as it helps him keep a &quot;pulse on what customers are feeling.&quot;

Tim Cook likes to begin his days early; he&#x27;s at his desk by 4am. &quot;I do that because I can control the morning better than the evening and through the day. Things happen through the day that kind of blow you off course,&quot; he tells The Australian Financial Review. &quot;The morning is yours. Or sh…</span>

                    <span>Twitter says it is rolling out a number of changes to the way direct messages work, including the ability to send a direct message to several people in different conversations. 





Going forward, Twitter says users will be able to share the same tweet in up to 20 separate direct message conversations, which should ensure &quot;no more (awkward) accidental group chats when you DM a tweet to multiple people.&quot;



Twitter says this change is rolling out on iOS and web over the next few weeks, with the changes coming &quot;soon&quot; on Android.



Twitter is also tweaking DM timestamps for iOS users in order to reduce &quot;timestamp clutter.&quot; Rather than having each message within a DM conversation stamped with the date and time, Messages will be grouped by day. 



In addition, the Twitter iOS app is gaining a couple of user interface tweaks, including a long-press gesture to access the &quot;add reaction&quot; buttons (previously only accessible via a double tap, and a new down-arrow button to return to the most recent message in a DM conversation after scrolling through.



Earlier this month, Twitter added support for Sign in With Apple, allowing new users to create an account using their Apple ID while hiding their true email address from the social network.

                    <span>Apple has delayed its plan to return employees back to the office until at least January, due to concerns over an increase in COVID-19 cases and the possible emergence of new variants, Bloomberg reports. 





Apple had previously planned to return to in-person work by early September, but the company delayed that timeline until October. Now, due to continued concerns, that timeframe has been further pushed back until at least January. 



In a memo sent to staff, obtained by Bloomberg, the company&#x27;s human resource and retail chief, Deirdre O’Brien, said that Apple is not planning to close its offices or retail stores that are currently open, but is encouraging employees to get vaccinated. Unlike other companies, Apple has yet to enforce a requirement for employees to be vaccinat…</span>

Philadelphia has locked up an RFA for a couple of seasons.
 The Philadelphia Flyers are continuing to work through their depth this summer and most recently, have brought back a familiar face to keep that dearth of mid-20’s forwards active.
Announced by the team on Friday, the Flyers have re-signed center Connor Bunnaman to a two-year deal that will have a two-way salary structure for the first season to a one-way deal in the second. Other than a league-minimum NHL salary of $750,000, further financial details have not been disclosed by the club.

The now-24-year-old returned to regular action last season after fighting Ewing’s sarcoma to win the Masterton Trophy.
 When you talk about perseverance, heart, character, and toughness, look no further than Flyers winger Oskar Lindblom. 
After battling a rare form of bone cancer that robbed him of what was a breakout 2019-20 season, Lindblom did the unthinkable — returning that very season to play in the Stanley Cup playoffs. Given what a tremendous battle Lindblom was facing, truly remarkable stuff that he was able to work his way into play shape after losing a ton of weight undergoing treatment for Ewing’s sarcoma. 
That taste of hockey propelled Lindblom into the offseason with sights set on getting fully back into shape and returnin…</span>

*Anyhoo, the Flyers. This summer saw the most action, roster-wise, in a very long time. Remember the last time the team made such wholesale change? [NBC Sports Philly]
*We chatted with our pals at The Cannon about their newest addition, and our recent subtraction. [The Cannon]
*The Golden Knights are hanging some hopes on Nolan Patrick. Oh, those sweet summer children. [ProHockeyTalk]

The first update to Inazuma hits in September 
 Genshin Impact’s giant update, The Immovable God and the Eternal Euthymia, is getting more content on Sept. 1. 
The 2.1 update, “Floating World Under the Moonlight,” will bring the main storyline in Inazuma to a close, and add new characters, additional boss fights, and two new islands to explore. And fishing is coming to Teyvat. (Everybody’s doing it!)
Genshin Impact developer Mihoyo released a trailer teasing some of the 2.1 content on Friday. It showed combat gameplay from new characters and a cinematic of Scaramouche laughing maniacally as the Traveler falls to the ground and blacks out — suggesting some sort of confrontation between the two. 
The update will bring new playable characters, including fan favorite Raiden Shogun (the Electro Archon also known as Baal) and Horizon Zero Dawn’s Aloy. Aloy will join the Genshin Impact cast in the 2.1 update as a free five-star archer, but comes first to those with PlayStation consoles via early access. Aloy and Shogun will be joined by Sangonomiya Kokomi, a five-star who wields the power of Hydro and is a catalyst, and Kujou Sara, a ranged attacker with Electro attacks.  
As for fishing, Mihoyo said in a news release that “players can soon go angling for a variety of fishes across the continent of Teyvat,” which can be used to produce fish meat of exchange for rewards.</span>

The announcement was made Friday in a video update by 343 Industries
 Halo Infinite won’t launch with two of the franchise’s most desirable features. Developers at 343 Industries said Friday that campaign co-op and the multiplayer map-editing Forge mode won’t be available when the game arrives. Forge in particular will lag behind “about six months.” The announcement was made on YouTube.
“Unfortunately as we focused the team for shutdown and really focused on a quality experience for launch we made the really tough decision to delay shipping campaign co-op for launch,” Staten said, “and we also made the tough call to delay shipping Forge past launch as well.”
343 announced one year ago that Halo Infinite would miss its original 2020 launch window, delaying the game into 2021. It still has no firm release date. On Friday, 343 said that the co-op campaign mode would be released as season 2 of Halo Infinite’s post-launch content, and that Forge mode would be part of season 3.
Staten said that these modes were delayed in order to ensure the quality of the base game.
“Our number one priority is making sure that whatever we ship, whenever we ship it, it meets the right quality bar across all platforms,” he said in the video. “And when we looked at these two experiences, campaign co-op and Forge, we made the determination they’re just not ready. And as a studio we don’t want to ship things if they’re not ready.”
Co-operative play has been at the heart of the Halo franchise since the beginning. Forge mode, which allows players to build their own multiplayer levels and game modes and share them online, was introduced with Halo 3 in 2007.</span>

Loads of new changes and decisions in a staple mode don’t seem like a lot, until they do
 Every year, Madden NFL seems to have a glaringly neglected mode. The great news — the best news — about Madden NFL 22: That mode is Madden Ultimate Team.
For once, MUT is the mode that goes begging. For once, Madden Ultimate Team is the mode that gets a maintenance-level update from last year. Good! Madden lifers have long resented MUT, for all its microtransactions and monetization, accusing it of sucking up what little oxygen a year’s development cycle leaves, while core features and gameplay are left gasping and semi-conscious. But for Madden NFL 22, EA Tiburon stood pat on MUT, and that alone is a message to the community, just as much as the Franchise m…</span>

Play on a selection of rotating maps in Trials this week
 Trials of Osiris is back in Destiny 2. Saint-14 is the new Trials vendor and announcer, and players can find him and his wares in the Tower Hangar every Friday at reset.
Each week, the Trials of Osiris map changes, as do the rewards for winning a certain number of matches. The rewards are consistent across all players, although each player’s weapon roll will differ.
Here are the guaranteed Trials of Osiris rewards this week:
Map: Rotating Maps
3 wins — Pyrrhic Ascent Cloak, Mark, Bond (Hunter, Titan, and Warlock class item)
5 wins — Shayura’s Wrath, Void submachine gun
7 wins — Pyrrhic Ascent Mask, Helm, Hood (Hunter, Titan, and Warlock helmet)
Flawless — Eye of Sol (Adept), Kinetic sniper rifle
Note: As of Season of Arrivals, players can complete the End Game weekly bounty — which just needs Trials match completions (wins give more progress) — to earn the three-win reward.
Players who manage to reach seven wins without a single loss can go to the Lighthouse social space — this is called a Flawless run. The Lighthouse offers additional rewards for players, some of which are unique, like a special emblem. Players who reach the Lighthouse also earn a special armor glow for any of their Trials of Osiris armor, which lasts for the remainder of the weekend.</span>

Head to the Tower for some Exotics
 The weekly Exotic item merchant, Xur, hangs out in random locations around the world of Destiny. In Destiny 2, he can appear all over the map, as well as inside the Tower. This week, you can find Xur in the Tower, in the Hangar, standing on the back steps.

Xur’s inventory this week consists of the following:
Trinity Ghoul, Arc bow: 29 Legendary Shards
Raiden Flux, Hunter chest: 23 Legendary Shards
One-Eyed Mask, Titan helmet: 23 Legendary Shards
Sanguine Alchemy, Warlock chest: 23 Legendary Shards
Exotic Engram: 97 Legendary Shards (you can now purchase a second with an Exotic Cipher)
Exotic Cipher quest: free


Xur’s items drop at a similar power level as your character.

Season of the Lost is one of Destiny 2’s biggest non-expansion updates in years
 Destiny 2’s upcoming Season of the Lost will see some major weapon changes. Players will not only get their hands on non-Exotic Stasis weapons for the first time, they’ll also see unlimited ammo for primary weapons and a host of potent Exotic changes.
In a blog post ahead of its Destiny Showcase on Tuesday, where players will learn all about season 15 and next year’s The Witch Queen expansion, Bungie detailed those Stasis weapons. Legendary Stasis weapons will go in either the Power slot — reserved for rocket launchers, drum-fed grenade launchers, swords, linear fusion rifles, and machine guns — or the kinetic slot.

Bungie revealed that Season of the Lost will start this Tuesday
 The name and art for Destiny 2’s 15th season leaked Thursday night, and Bungie officially confirmed it on Friday morning. Season of the Lost, starring Mara Sov, will start on Tuesday, Aug. 24, immediately following Bungie’s Destiny Showcase. The developer will reveal the new season and the upcoming The Witch Queen expansion during the livestream.
Normally, a simple season name and the reveal of its main characters only serve to hype players up. But Season of the Lost’s name and Mara’s involvement bring a certain weight: Both details appear in a major, months-old leak. With Bungie’s confirmation, one of the biggest rumors in the series’ history just got a lot more credible.

                    <span>For the New Yorker, the novelist Donald Antrim wrote about wanting to die by suicide and being saved by electroconvulsive therapy: Finding a Way Back from Suicide.
I had survived, or thought that I’d survived, my parents’ drinking and shouting, our constant moving, the losses of places and friends, annihilation after annihilation. I’d played in the yard, and smashed tennis balls against walls for hours, and built model airplanes, and listened to my records at night in my room. I’d slept with cats for company, and ridden my bike, and struggled in school, and, later in life, gone to bars, and then quit going to bars, and smoked cigarettes and pot, and fallen in love, and argued and made up, and refused to speak to my father, and suffered my mother. None of this had stopped my dying. Writing had not stopped my dying. The Twelve Steps had not stopped my dying. Therapy hadn’t stopped it, and my old friends couldn’t stop it; nor could Regan. No one could.

                    <span>I’ve been a bit obsessed recently with urban architecture that incorporates nature &amp; greenery into the mix, especially since seeing the technique employed so creatively in Singapore last year, so this new book called Evergreen Architecture is tickling that fancy right now.
As more of the earth’s surface is swallowed up by the built environment, architects are increasingly advised to integrate urban flora and fauna into their designs. Whether developing green roofs, living walls, abundant indoor courtyards, or balconies that connect interior and exterior spaces, the urge to intertwine nature and architecture has never been more apparent.
Embracing this ubiquitous trend, Evergreen Architecture surveys a broad spectrum of residential, institutional, urban, and rural spaces. But as change occurs and solutions to the climate crisis are being integrated on the ground, many new questions are posed. How do residents keep moss-covered walls alive? How can a skyscraper uphold the weight of hundreds of trees?


You can order the book from Bookshop. (via colossal)

                    <span>The United States Federal Trade Commission today reinforced its antitrust case against Facebook by providing more detail on how the company either crushed or bought out its rivals in an attempt to get rid of competition.





The updated filing is longer than the original complaint and it offers additional evidence in favor of the FTC&#x27;s argument that Facebook is a monopolist, plus it again asks the judge overseeing the case to force Facebook to sell Instagram and WhatsApp, the two social networking apps that Facebook also operates.



In the complaint, the FTC says that Facebook used an illegal &quot;buy-or-bury&quot; scheme to maintain its dominance in the social networking market after it failed to &quot;develop innovative mobile features&quot; during the transition from desktop to mobile devices.…</span>

                    <span>Apple supplier Foxconn is making a major push into electric vehicle manufacturing and has long been aiming to get into the vehicle market, according to a new profile of Foxconn&#x27;s car ambitions that was shared by Nikkei.





&quot;If we can make iPhones, why can&#x27;t we make EVs?&quot; Foxconn founder and former chairman Terry Gou said in an internal meeting. &quot;It is an iPhone with four wheels.&quot;



Foxconn has been pursuing electric vehicles since 2014 when there was an &quot;A-Fu Initiative&quot; to build an electric vehicle prototype. That project ultimately folded because of the complexity of creating a car, but Foxconn is once again building up a vehicle supply chain with plans to get into EV manufacturing.

                    <span>Apple has temporarily shut down its retail store located in Charleston, South Carolina after more than 20 staff members were exposed to or tested positive for COVID-19, reports Bloomberg.





According to the website for the store, it will be shuttered until Monday, August 23. According to Bloomberg, stores of this size typically have 70 to 80 employees, so around a quarter of the staff may have been exposed.



Apple appears to be suffering from staff shortages at the Charleston store and other retail locations, both because of COVID exposures and the difficult labor market. Stores remain operational at this time, but some have been forced to close earlier and open later because of a lack of staff.



Continuing issues with the delta variant of COVID-19 have impacted Apple&#x27;s store plans. Apple stopped requiring customers and employees to wear masks back in June, but then reinstated mask mandates at many retail locations in the United States in late July. So far though, Apple has not reinstated widespread store shutdowns.



Apple had also planned to bring back in-person Today at Apple classes on August 30, but has since pushed back those plans because of the prevalence of the delta variant.

Hide My Email builds on the idea of Sign in With Apple by providing you with unique, random email addresses that forward to your personal inbox whenever you want to keep your personal email address private. 



It&#x27;s especially useful if you suspect that a business you&#x27;re transacting with is likely to share your email address with ad agencies or other third-parties for marketing purposes.

                    <span>Nanoleaf today announced the addition of Thread Border Router technology to the Nanoleaf Shapes and Elements Controllers, with the functionality available through a firmware update in the Nanoleaf app.





With the Nanoleaf Border Router, Nanoleaf Essentials devices will be able to connect to the Thread network automatically when the Shapes or Elements Controller is connected to WiFi.



Nanoleaf is also partnering with Eero for similar capabilities. The Eero Pro, Eero Beacon, Eero Pro 6, and Eero 6 will function as Border Routers with the Nanoleaf Essentials line. Eero will expand compatibility with other products in the future.



Nanoleaf is one of the first companies bringing Thread Border Routers to the HomeKit network, making Thread technology available to other Thread-based smart home devices.



Thread technology is designed to improve the smart home networking and usage experience. Thread is a networking protocol designed for smart home products, and it offers improved connectivity, reliability, and range compared to the single connection points of Bluetooth and WiFi. Border Router technology connects a Thread network to another network like WiFi and is essential for the Thread system.



With Thread Border Router functionality built into the Nanoleaf Shapes Controller, Elements Controller, and Eero routers, there is no need for an extra hub because these devices serve as a bridge to connect the WiFi network and the Thread network together.

Apple TV


Low prices on the Apple TV start at $129.98 for the Apple TV HD bundled with the new Siri Remote on Amazon. This is a match of the lowest price we&#x27;ve ever seen on this model, and it first appeared online earlier in August.





This version is the same fourth generation Apple TV HD device that was released in 2015, but now it&#x27;s bundled with the revamped Siri Remote. The new accessory features a one-piece aluminum body, tactile clickpad …</span>

The email, spotted in a trove of evidence by The Verge, was sent by late Apple CEO Steve Jobs to fellow executives in October of 2010, months after the company had released the ‌iPhone‌ 4. The email consists of several different business plans for 2011, including Jobs wanting Apple to find its identity, its best selling points, and Apple&#x27;s &quot;Holy War with Google.&quot;

                    <span>Apple TV+ today shared the official trailer for highly-anticipated sci-fi series &quot;Foundation&quot; ahead of its premiere on September 24.






Based on the best-selling novels by Isaac Asimov, Apple says &quot;Foundation&quot; is an epic saga chronicling a band of exiles on their monumental journey to save humanity and rebuild civilization amid the fall of the Galactic Empire.
When revolutionary Dr. Hari Seldon predicts the impending fall of the Empire, he and a band of loyal followers venture to the far reaches of the galaxy to establish The Foundation in an attempt to rebuild and preserve the future of civilization. Enraged by Hari&#x27;s claims, the ruling Cleons – a long line of emperor clones – fear their grasp on the galaxy may be weakening as they&#x27;re forced to reckon with the potential reality of losing their legacy forever.
&quot;Foundation&quot; stars Emmy Award nominees Jared Harris and Lee Pace, alongside Lou Llobell, Leah Harvey, Laura Birn, Terrence Mann, Cassian Bilton, and Alfred Enoch.



The first episode of &quot;Foundation&quot; will be released on Apple TV+ on September 24, followed by one new episode weekly every Friday. Series writer and showrunner David Goyer hopes to tell the story over the course of 80 episodes.



Apple TV+ costs $4.99 per month, with a free seven-day trial available, or a longer trial available with the purchase of select new Apple products.

                    <span>Apple today highlighted that the Apple Card and Goldman Sachs has been ranked top for customer satisfaction in the midsized issuer credit card segment, according to J.D. Power.





The J.D. Power 2021 U.S. Credit Card Satisfaction Study showed that the ‌Apple Card‌ ranked highest with a score of 864.1, across all of the surveyed categories including interaction, credit card terms, communication, benefits and services, rewards, and key moments. Apple&#x27;s vice president of Apple Pay, Jennifer Bailey, said:
It is exciting to be recognized with this first J.D. Power win, just two years after introducing Apple Card in 2019 and the first time being included in this study. We designed Apple Card to help our customers lead healthier financial lives, so it&#x27;s incredibly meaningful to see that our customers are valuing this. Being recognized as the leader in this category this year is an honor, and we look forward to continuing to deliver this product, service, and support with our award-winning issuer as Apple Card expands to more and more customers across the U.S.




The ‌Apple Card‌ launched in 2019 as a no-fee credit card designed for the iPhone and supported by Goldman Sachs, featuring Apple Wallet integration and Daily Cash rewards with up to three percent cashback. The card is only available in the United States.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/19/alleged-cutout-of-sixth-generation-ipad-mini/">

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(8 min)</span>
                    <span>Images of an aluminum cutout allegedly based on the upcoming sixth-generation iPad mini have surfaced online. The cutout is largely in line with rumors of what we can expect in the ‌iPad mini‌ 6, including a larger display in lieu of a Home button, a thinner body, and flat edges.





The images originated from the website techordo.com in cooperation with a leaker named xleaks7, whose track record for accurate leaks isn&#x27;t very well established. The cutout showcases a design much in line with renders of the upcoming ‌iPad mini‌ shared by Apple leaker Jon Prosser earlier in June.



One interesting new change the images depict is the relocation of the volume buttons. The volume buttons on iPads have always been on the right side, however, the images show the buttons relocated to the top, on the opposite side of the power button. 



The new ‌iPad mini‌ will take inspiration from the updated iPad Air and iPad Pro by ditching the Home Button in favor of an all-screen design. Apple is unlikely to provide users with Face ID embedded into the bezel and is expected instead to integrate Touch ID into the power button, similar to the ‌iPad Air‌. It&#x27;s also expected to feature a faster processor and possibly USB-C. 



Reliable Bloomberg journalist Mark Gurman has reported that the new iPad mini is on track to be released this fall, alongside new iPhones, Apple Watches, AirPods, and MacBook Pros.

                    <span>An international coalition of more than 90 policy and rights groups published an open letter on Thursday urging Apple to abandon its plans to &quot;build surveillance capabilities into iPhones, iPads, and other products&quot; – a reference to the company&#x27;s intention to scan users&#x27; iCloud photo libraries for images of child sex abuse (via Reuters).

                    <span>As the back-to-school season kicks in, Apple plans to update its baseline iPad this fall with a new ninth-generation model tailored towards students, sporting a thinner design and an improved processor, according to Bloomberg&#x27;s Mark Gurman.





In September of last year, Apple updated the baseline iPad with the faster and more powerful A12 Bionic chip starting at $329, or $299 for education customers. The baseline update sits at the lower end of the ‌iPad‌ lineup and is tailored for customers needing an affordable ‌iPad‌ for day-to-day use.



For the 9th generation model, Apple is likely to continue with the current design featuring Touch ID and a Home Button. The updated model will feature a faster processor with improved performance and graphics and a thinner form factor.



The updated ‌iPad‌ joins a busy fall season for Apple, as the company is also expected to be preparing a more significant update to the iPad mini. The new iPad mini is rumored to feature a larger display with smaller bezels, improved performance, and an updated overall design. Apple is also preparing new iPhones, Apple Watches, AirPods, and MacBook Pros for launch in the coming months.

                    <span>Apple this evening began offering refurbished versions of the 24-inch M1 iMac in its U.S. online store, one day after starting to sell refurbished ‌M1‌ iMacs in the UK.





Apple has over a dozen ‌M1‌ iMacs available at the current time, and this is the first time the ‌M1‌ iMacs have been available through the refurbished store in the U.S. since the machines launched in April.



The entry-level model with 8-core GPU, 7-core GPU, and 256GB SSD is available for $1,099, which is a $200 discount from the regular price of $1,299.



Apple also has higher-end refurbished models available for purchase, up to an 8-core CPU and 8-core GPU option with a 1TB SSD and 16GB RAM, which is available for $1,779. At full price, the machine would cost $2,099.



There are multiple color options and configurations available at the current time, though stock will fluctuate going forward based on the machines that people are sending Apple for repairs and returns.



Apple&#x27;s refurbished ‌M1‌ iMacs are sold with the same one-year warranty offered with a new ‌iMac‌, plus they come with all manuals and accessories. Apple uses a rigorous testing, repair, repackaging, and cleaning process to ensure refurbished devices are identical to new devices.

This list isn’t meant to make you feel bad about your writing. I’ve probably
done all of these things! I’m certainly going to do them again! I even did at

Nightborne and Lightforged Draenei get a treat
 When World of Warcraft: Shadowlands launched, there was with a buffet of character customization options for humans, night elves, orcs, and undead. However, a few of the races — especially the game’s Allied Races, which don’t have their own starting zone and can only be unlocked in the end game — fell a little short. Blizzard stated that they would not be revisiting the issue during Shadowlands, but it looks like that’s about to change. On Thursday, a community manager shared the following information on the official Blizzard forums.
Our characters in game are a virtual representation of who we are in Azeroth and having more character customization options to design our characters helps us feel closer to…</span>

The anniversary edition arrives Nov. 11
 Bethesda announced a new edition of the fantasy RPG The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim on Thursday, during QuakeCon at Home 2021. Skyrim is about to turn 10, which is a very momentous anniversary indeed, and the new Anniversary Edition will have some nice bonuses for players. 
Skyrim’s Anniversary Edition will be available for players on the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. The Anniversary Edition contains the full game, all enhancements from the Special Edition, and the Dawnguard, Hearthfire, and Dragonborn expansions.
The game comes with a free next-gen console upgrade, over 500 Creation Club elements like quests, dungeons, bosses, and weapons.  Also, there’s fishing now, which is great. You could argue that Skyrim didn’t need a fishing pole, but it’s always nice to have a fishing minigame, and the elements from popular mods will likely round the experience out as well.
It’s a common joke that Skyrim will never die, especially because Bethesda continues to re-release and port the game. The base game can run on less powerful platforms like the Nintendo Switch, and in 2018, Bethesda debuted a joke announcement for Skyrim: Very Special Edition, which is an actual playable game on the iPhone, iPad, and Amazon Echo ... as long as you can figure out the voice commands. The Elder Scrolls 6 remains elusive, but fans will be able to tuck into Skyrim once again and enjoy all of their old quests — as well as a new spin, thanks to fishing.</span>

Plus, you can date weapons
 The sincerity with which developer Kitfox Games enters into Boyfriend Dungeon is contagious. It’d otherwise be easy to write the game off as a joke, a concept that’s wacky just to be wacky. I mean, it’s a dating simulator in which you date people that can turn into weapons, which can then be used to fight through monstrous dungeons. But it’s a concept that’s executed in earnest, with thoughtfulness and care grounding the otherwise implausible world. It was easy to just go with it. So yeah, the game is about dating people that you’ll also use as weapons to fight your insecurities. What of it?

Black Panther absorbs attacks 
 Marvel’s Avengers’ version of Black Panther is impervious to most attacks, and it makes him as kinetic to play as his MCU counterpart is to watch.
The first expansion for Marvel’s Avengers, War for Wakanda, hit the game earlier this week and added Black Panther to the list of playable heroes. With the roster up to nine Avengers, making the heroes stand out is key to the games’ success. But Black Panther has some defensive abilities that make him a blast to play. 
There are three different varieties of enemy attacks in Marvel’s Avengers: light attacks, strong attacks, and unblockable attacks. For strong attacks, players either need to time a parry to avoid damage or dodge out of the way. And as you might expect, un…</span>

Plus a new Quake expansion pack
 Three Quake games — Quake, Quake 2, and Quake 3 Arena — are now available through Xbox Game Pass. Microsoft announced the additions on Thursday alongside the start of QuakeCon 2021, shortly after id Software revealed and released a remastered version of the original Quake.
Quake’s enhanced version is available on Xbox consoles and Windows PC via Xbox Game Pass, while Quake 2 and Quake 3: Arena can be played on Windows PC through the subscription service “in their original form.” In other words, Quake 2 and Quake 3 haven’t been remastered. Players looking to enjoy Quake 2 in prettier form should check out the free Quake 2 RTX release, pictured above.
Bethesda Software’s remastered Quake, a new version of the 25-year-old game, has 4K resolution support, cross-platform play, enhanced visuals, and a new expansion pack from Wolfenstein developer MachineGames. It’s also available on its own on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 (and PlayStation 5 via backward compatibility), and Windows PC.
The three Quake games join a lineup that includes more than 30 Bethesda Softworks-published titles, many of which were added to Xbox Game Pass following Microsoft’s acquisition of Bethesda.</span>

The original Colors is from 2010, but this animation is all new
 Sonic Colors: Ultimate is an upcoming remaster of the original Wii platformer, and Sega has released a cartoon for players who need a refresher on the game’s lore. “Rise of the Wisps” is a two-part animation, and the first part was released on Thursday. Directed by Tyson Hesse, the artist behind Sonic Mania Adventures, Rise of the Wisps tells the story of Sonic, Tails, and one Jade Wisp, who needs help taking down Dr. Eggman.
The animations and cartoons surrounding Sonic releases are some of the best hedgehog-related content in years. Even if you’re not a fan of the games themselves, it’s nice to see that Tails, Sonic and company are still up to their old hijinks. While the upcoming Part 2 of Rise of the Wisps will probably have much more action, Part 1 helps set the scene, and it includes some fun exchanges between Tails, the Jade Wisp, and Sonic.
The next mainline game in the Sonic series is currently planned for 2022, and is a 3D game, although details are otherwise light. Sonic Colors: Ultimate is set to release on Sept. 7 on the Epic Games Store, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.</span>

id Software classic gets 4K/60 fps support and new expansion from MachineGames
 Bethesda Softworks released a remastered version of the original Quake, the landmark first-person shooter id Software published 25 years ago, on Thursday. The new version of Quake includes 4K resolution support, cross-platform play, enhanced visuals, and a brand-new expansion pack from Wolfenstein developer MachineGames.
The remastered Quake is available now on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows PC, and Xbox One, and is playable through backward compatibility on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. On PC, Steam and Bethesda Launcher users who already own Quake will automatically receive the new version with a free download. 
In terms of visuals, players can expect improved lighting and models, dynamic shadows, motion blur, and anti-aliasing. The game’s score, produced by Nine Inch Nails’ Trent Reznor, is also included. Expansion packs Scourge of Armagon, Dissolution of Eternity, and Dimension of the Past (the new, MachineGames-created add-on), are now included as part of the standard Quake package. More details are available at Bethesda’s announcement.
The original Quake, which launched in the summer of 1996, was id’s successor to the Doom series. Although it, too, launched as a single-player FPS with a campaign, it became much more popular as a multiplayer arena shooter. It was followed by four sequels between 1997 and 2007.
Bethesda acquired id Software and its franchises in 2009, but the only Quake title published since then is 2017’s Quake Champions on Windows PC, which is now a free-to-play game.</span>

But maybe a good game isn’t the point
 Fortnite’s new Impostors event is simple: Ten players enter a station, but two of them are impostors. The innocent crew members need to complete a series of tasks around the map without getting murdered — or at least while catching the murderer as quickly as possible. Yes, there’s no way around it: It’s Among Us. 
Among Us’ gameplay loop is simple and lean; Fortnite’s Imposters clutters it up. Impostors is visually busy and crowded, and it’s not just because everyone has their fancy 3D model with custom skins and emotes attached. It’s hard to see myself playing it with family members, much less politicians using it as a public outreach tool.

Health regen is back
 Call of Duty: Vanguard will bring the series back to World War II. But it’s not a continuation of developer Sledgehammer Games’ previous WWII game, nor will Vanguard carry over Call of Duty: WWII’s health pack system. Vanguard will instead use the automatic health regeneration system common to modern Call of Duty games.
During a presentation lead by Sledgehammer Games, Call of Duty: Vanguard game director Josh Bridge said that the game’s campaign will feature automatic health regen, for a “more unified experience.
“[The] campaign will have auto health regen,” Bridge said in a statement to Polygon. “[The] goal is to keep to a more unified experience between modes, and matching health systems was something that the team felt was important. Coupled with that decision, each of the main characters you play as bring unique to them abilities/mechanics in their levels. This further drives an overall sense of gameplay variety across the campaign, but also these abilities help distinguish each character’s identity.”
Call of Duty: Vanguard will span four theaters of war and four playable characters: Sgt. Arthur Kingsley, of Britain’s 9th Parachute Battalion; Lt. Polina Petrova, of the Soviet 138th Rifle Division; Captain Wade Jackson, from the U.S.’s Scouting Squadron Six; and Second Lieutenant Lucas Riggs of Australia’s 20th Battalion. For more on the game, check out Polygon’s preview.
At the same time that Vanguard is being shown for the first time, Call of Duty publisher Activision Blizzard faces wide-ranging allegations that it maintains a toxic workplace environment that is particularly hostile to women. A lawsuit, filed by California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing in July, alleges the company pays women less, subjects them to sexual harassment, and that perpetrators are not meaningfully punished.

Vanguard Zombies will tie into Black Ops Cold War’s Zombies mode
 Treyarch’s Call of Duty Zombies modes are usually limited to the games the studio develops itself, but that’s not the case this time around. During Thursday’s announcement stream for Call of Duty: Vanguard, Activision revealed that the Sledgehammer-developed game will feature a Zombies mode made by Treyarch.
Treyarch’s latest Zombie content was for Black Ops Cold War, which it also developed. Unlike previous games, the Zombie content in Black Ops Cold War came as part of free seasonal updates to the game, rather than expansion packs that players had to pay for. On top of the extremely popular round-based maps, Treyarch also introduced a new mode called Outbreak that throws players and zombies together inside a massive open area where players have to complete a series of random objectives. 
Treyarch’s Zombies entries have also continued to tell an ongoing story, which just got a new update with the latest round-based map. It’s unclear if the Zombies mode in Vanguard will continue Treyarch’s Black Ops storyline or be something entirely separate. 
Call of Duty: Vanguard will be released on Nov. 5. Activision and Treyarch hasn’t announced if the Zombies mode will arrive when the game launches or sometime after. 
At the same time Vanguard is being shown for the first time, Call of Duty publisher Activision Blizzard faces wide-ranging allegations that it maintains a toxic workplace environment that is particularly hostile to women. A lawsuit, filed by California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing in July, alleges the company pays women less, subjects them to sexual harassment, and that perpetrators are not meaningfully punished.

                    <span>Americans are collectively almost $15 trillion in debt, most of it related to housing (i.e. mortgage debt). For the New Yorker, Margaret Talbot shares some images from Brittany Powell’s The Debt Project, a series of 99 portraits of Americans in debt.
Powell set about photographing ninety-nine Americans who owe money (she ended up with a few more, including herself, but started with that figure as a reference to the slogan “We are the ninety-nine per cent”) and asked them to handwrite accompanying text about how much they owe, and to whom. The litany of reasons gets repetitive, because that’s how it goes — difficulty finding a job in one’s field after graduating during the recession, a bad marriage, a bad divorce, vertiginous rents in expensive cities, medical crises, many, many student loans. Occasionally, there are epic and awful variations: one woman’s mother took out credit cards in her name and, in a ten-year period, racked up “a mortgage worth of debt” to fund her “compulsive shopping and hoarding habits.”


The Debt Project is also available in book form.

                    <span>Well. The robots sure are getting good at moving around — running, jumping, doing flips, casually vaulting over railings like an eighth grader trying to impress friends. It is eerie and weird and uncanny and all other such adjectives watching these machines smoothly caper around like humans. Even in the blooper reel they seem really toddler-esque.

                    <span>Jumbo the Elephant was one of the most famous animals in the world. Bought as a calf in Sudan by a European animal dealer in 1860, Jumbo found fame first at the London Zoo and later as the centerpiece of the Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus in the US. Jumbo was so beloved in London that news of his sale to P.T. Barnum prompted 100,000 children to write to Queen Victoria, urging her to nix the deal. In the video above, Andrew McClellan recounts Jumbo’s too-short (and probably unhappy) life and the impact he had on society.
The word “jumbo” hadn’t been known or used in the English language before he came along and has since become the byword for anything humongous or supersized. So every time we use the word “jumbo jet” or “jumbotron”, we’re actually referring back to Jumbo the elephant.

                    <span>Juli Clover, again:
Apple in iOS 15 beta 6 has added a toggle to move the Safari
address bar to the top of the interface, which returns Safari to
an iOS 14-like design and mitigates all of the Safari changes
introduced in earlier betas.
Those who prefer the bottom bar can still opt to have that toggled
on with the Tab Bar view, but Apple has also changed the look and
the url bar at the bottom has been merged with a dedicated control
panel that does away with trying to merge all page management
options into a single address bar view.
I was a little worried when beta 5 shipped last week and Safari’s interface was unchanged, but beta 6’s changes are very good.
The initial iOS Safari 15 design failed in two big ways. First and foremost, Apple tried to squeeze two horizontal bars’ worth of cont…</span>

                    <span>Juli Clover, writing for MacRumors:
Netflix is rolling out support for Spatial Audio on the iPhone and
the iPad, based on reports shared by MacRumors readers
and on Reddit. A Netflix spokesperson also confirmed to
MacRumors that the rollout is underway.
When you’re watching a movie on an iPhone or iPad, spatial audio is a  game changer for degree of immersiveness. Henceforth when preloading a movie or two for a plane trip, I’ll favor titles with spatial audio support. It really helps make up for the small screen by having big immersive sound.
Not surprised that Netflix is adding support sooner rather than later — one thing Netflix gets right is they want viewers to be happy. Spatial audio makes me happy.

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…

*The dev camp participant list is looking pretty good top to bottom, honestly. Should be fun to watch, if we can go. [Inquirer]
*Robert Hagg, good luck out there buddy. You had a good season on your way out the door. [BSH]
*Cam Atkinson seems to bring a lot to the table, but there are two specific ways he should be able to help the Flyers in a big way this season. [NBC Sports Philly]
*The Flyers’ most recently drafted goalie doesn’t crack to top ten, but he got darn close. [The Athletic]
*Yesterday we learned, officially, that jersey advertisements are coming to the NHL this season. [ProHockeyTalk]
*And finally, with that news being reports, we couldn’t help but wonder: whose logo should make its way onto the Flyers’ orange and black? [BSH]</span>

                    <span>Johnny Cirillo photographs people on the streets of New York in the style of paparazzi (half a block away with a long lens) and posts them, with permission, to his Instagram account. From an interview with Cirillo in Vogue:
I decided early-on that if I was going to shoot candids of New Yorkers, I didn’t want it to be with a wide lens, up-close in their faces. I started using a 200mm lens so that I could be half a city block away from the subject. It’s similar to the way paparazzi shoot, and all my subjects are celebrities to me, so it’s fitting in that respect.

                    <span>Apple today seeded the sixth beta of the upcoming watchOS 8 update to developers for testing purposes, with the update coming one week after Apple released the fifth watchOS 8 beta.





To install ‌‌watchOS 8‌‌, developers will need to download the configuration profile from the Apple Developer Center. Once installed, ‌‌watchOS 8‌‌ can be downloaded through the dedicated Apple Watch app on the iPhone by going to General &gt; Software update.



To update to new software, an Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery life, it must be placed on the charger, and it needs to be in range of the ‌‌iPhone‌‌. It&#x27;s not recommended to install ‌‌watchOS 8‌‌ on a main Apple Watch as the software may be unstable at this early date.

                    <span>Apple released the sixth beta of iOS 15 just a week after the fifth beta, but the new update brings some of the most significant tweaks that we&#x27;ve seen to ‌iOS 15‌ during the beta testing period.





Safari Redesign


Apple in ‌iOS 15‌ beta 6 has added a toggle to move the Safari address bar to the top of the interface, which returns Safari to an iOS 14-like design and mitigates all of the Safari changes introduced in earlier betas.





Those who prefer the bottom bar can still opt to have that toggled on with the Tab Bar view, but Apple has also changed the look and the url bar at the bottom has been merged with a dedicated control panel that does away with trying to merge all page management options into a single address bar view.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/17/google-5g-low-cost-pixel-5a-smartphone/">

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(8 min)</span>
                    <span>Google today announced the launch of the low-cost 5G Pixel 5a, a follow up to the Pixel 4a that debuted last year. At its $449 price point, the Pixel 5a most closely competes with the $399 iPhone SE, which is $50 cheaper, though it has a similar feature set to Apple&#x27;s $699 iPhone 12 mini thanks to the inclusion of 5G.





Apple is rumored to be working on a new version of the ‌iPhone SE‌ that will also include 5G, with the device set to launch in 2022. The updated ‌iPhone SE‌ will be positioned as Apple&#x27;s cheapest 5G iPhone, and based on the $449 price point of the Pixel 5a, it could be priced similarly to keep it competitive with lower-cost Android devices.



In addition to 5G mmWave and sub-6GHz connectivity, the Pixel 5a brings a bigger 6.3-inch hole punch display that offers more available screen space than the prior Pixel 4a, so it may still have an edge over Apple&#x27;s upcoming 2022 ‌iPhone SE‌. The new ‌iPhone SE‌ is rumored to feature a design that&#x27;s &quot;roughly the same&quot; as the current ‌iPhone SE‌, which is modeled after the iPhone 8.



Other Pixel 5a features include IP67 water resistance, a dual camera setup with wide and ultra wide lenses, a 4,620mAh battery, 6GB RAM, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G chip.



Google is selling the Pixel 5a with an 18W adapter that supports fast charging, but Google is taking a page from Apple&#x27;s playbook. The Pixel 5a will be the last Pixel phone that will include a charger, according to The Verge. Google says that because most people already have a charging brick, its future phones, including the upcoming Pixel 6, will not ship with one.



Apple stopped providing a 5W charger with ‌iPhone‌ models in 2020 and in most countries, iPhones no longer come with a charger.

                    <span>Apple today released a new firmware update for the Siri Remote designed for the new Apple TV 4K and ‌Apple TV‌ HD models. The new firmware has an internal version number of 9M6772, while the prior firmware version was 9M6336. Note that this is not the firmware version that you see in the ‌Apple TV‌ Remote settings. 





There&#x27;s no word on what&#x27;s new with the ‌Apple TV‌ remote update, but it likely addresses minor bugs and performance issues. 



Apple has not detailed how to install a firmware update for the ‌Siri‌ Remote, but it&#x27;s likely similar to AirPods, delivered silently and over the air while the ‌Apple TV‌ is asleep. Firmware updates are installed in the background and it may take some time for the ‌Siri‌ Remote update to be downloaded and installed.

                    <span>Tweetbot 6 designed for the iPhone and the iPad today received a major update, with Tapbots introducing several significant new features that are designed to make the app experience better than ever.





There&#x27;s now a Tweetbot 6 widget that can be added to the Today View or the Home Screen, and it shows the Twitter timeline. A single tweet can be shown in the smallest widget view, but there are also larger options that show more tweets at a glance.



When using the Tweetbot 6 update on iOS devices, there&#x27;s now support for Handoff, so you can resume what you were doing on one device on another device using the built-in Handoff feature. Handoff does not yet work on the Mac, but support will be added later.



Tweetbot 6 now supports Shortcuts so Tweetbot actions can be used in the shortcuts created on iOS devices, plus on the ‌iPad‌, multiple Tweetbot windows are now supported for multitasking purposes. There are also additional app icons to choose from.



Tweetbot 6 can be downloaded from the App Store for free, but a subscription costs $5.99 per year or $0.99 per month. [Direct Link]

                    <span>Apple has renewed &quot;Carpool Karaoke: The Series&quot; for a fifth season, and with the renewal, the TV show will be migrating from Apple Music to Apple TV+. &quot;Carpool Karaoke&quot; could be watched through the ‌Apple Music‌ app or the Apple TV app, but it has not previously been a part of ‌Apple TV+‌ and limited to ‌Apple TV+‌ subscribers.





Based on the &quot;Carpool Karaoke&quot; segment of the &quot;The Late Late Show With James Corden,&quot; Apple&#x27;s version of &quot;Carpool Karaoke&quot; has been available since 2017.



Filming on &quot;Carpool Karaoke&quot; has been on hiatus due to the ongoing pandemic, according to Deadline, but efforts are underway to begin production once again.



&quot;Carpool Karaoke: The Series&quot; brings various actors, athletes, and musicians together to chat and sing popular songs with one another. The fourth season of the show featured pairings like Maya Rudolph and Haim, Keegan-Michael Key and Rob Gronkowski, and the &quot;Shark Tank&quot; sharks.



There&#x27;s no word yet on which celebrities will be featured in the fifth season of the show.

Apple will ask Apple Watch owners to complete a hike, walk, run, or wheelchair workout of a mile to earn a special National Parks award.
Let&#x27;s take a day to appreciate the beauty of national parks all over the world. On August 28, earn this award by recording a hike, walk, run, or wheelchair workout of a mile (1.6K) or more with any app that adds workouts to Health.
As with all Activity Challenges, the award will be accompanied by animated stickers that can be used in the Messages app.

















Apple always celebrates national parks in August, and last year introduced an Apple Pay donation program and highlighted Apple TV+ content, Apple Music songs, podcasts, books, and more all focused on national parks.

                    <span>Apple in iOS 15 introduced a new Safari experience that moves the URL bar and tab interface to the bottom of the iPhone, a decision that has been controversial with ‌iPhone‌ users.




Safari options in ‌iOS 15‌ beta 6


Throughout the beta testing period, Apple has been tweaking the design of the Safari browser on the ‌iPhone‌ and in beta 6, there are further refinements. The bottom tab bar has been redesigned to appear below page content, and Apple has also added a toggle to show the address bar at the top of the ‌iPhone‌ rather than the bottom.




The original design in ‌iOS 15‌ beta 5


The addition of a toggle to show the address bar at the top of the Safari interface returns Safari to a more iOS 14-like experience, walking back many of the ‌iOS 15‌ changes.





With the bottom view option toggled on, Safari offers a dedicated toolbar with buttons at the bottom of the interface, which is also an improvement over the prior floating design.



Apple has also introduced new setting options to remove the website tinting and to enable a Tab Bar while in landscape mode. There was previously a &quot;Show Color in Tab Bar&quot; accessibility setting, which appears to be the same as the new &quot;Allow Website Tinting&quot; toggle.  



Apple previously added similar toggles in iPadOS 15 and macOS Monterey to offer either a separate tab bar (which was the original default when the betas launched) or a merged tab bar, which is more similar to the previous design.

                    <span>In the beta notes for the sixth updates to iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and tvOS 15, Apple says that the FaceTime SharePlay feature has been disabled for future beta releases and will not be available to use when the updates initially launch this fall. 





Apple will instead make SharePlay available in an update to ‌iOS 15‌, ‌iPadOS 15‌, tvOS 15, and macOS Monterey that&#x27;s coming later this year. 



With SharePlay being removed temporarily, Apple is offering an alternative tool for developers to test SharePlay development features, and a SharePlay profile is available for developers to download. 
SharePlay has been disabled for use in iOS and iPadOS 15 developer beta 6 and will be disabled for use in its initial release this fall. SharePlay will be enabled for use again in future developer beta releases and will launch to the public in software updates later this fall. To continue your development, we have provided a SharePlay Development Profile which will enable successful creation and reception of GroupSessions via the Group Activities API.
With SharePlay, ‌FaceTime‌ users can share their screens with one another, watch movies and TV shows in sync together, listen to music and contribute to a group playlist, and more.

                    <span>Apple today announced that a new version of Temple Run is coming to Apple Arcade in the near future, and based on the game&#x27;s description, it will merge classic endless runner gameplay with match 3 puzzles.





Players will be tasked with assisting adventurer, archeologist, and Temple Runner Scarlett Fox, solving puzzles to overcome obstacles. Players will create powerful match 3 combos and use special pieces to become the Temple Champion, sending out runners to chase treasure before the demon monkey catches up to them.

                    <span>Apple today seeded the sixth beta of the upcoming tvOS 15 update to developers for testing purposes, with the new beta coming one week released the fifth beta.





Developers can download the new tvOS 15 beta by downloading a profile onto the ‌Apple TV‌ using Xcode.



Apple shared little about tvOS 15 when it was unveiled, but there are some new features that are coming to the operating system. SharePlay, a FaceTime feature that lets multiple users watch TV shows or movies together, will integrate with tvOS, and there&#x27;s a new &quot;For All of You&quot; recommendation engine that suggests shows everyone might enjoy.



A Shared With You section also displays movies and shows that were shared with you through the Messages app so you remember to check them out. When paired with AirPods Pro or AirPods Max, the ‌Apple TV‌ supports Spatial audio for a theater-like surround sound experience, and there&#x27;s a new feature for automatically connecting your AirPods through Smart ‌AirPods‌ routing.



Hey Siri commands can be used to launch Apple TV+ shows, and two HomePod mini speakers can be paired with the ‌Apple TV‌ 4K for stereo sound. If you have HomeKit cameras, you can also now view multiple cameras at the same time on the ‌Apple TV‌.

In-person Today at Apple sessions will no longer be resuming at this time, with Apple putting in-person classes off because of the ongoing rise of the Delta variant across the United States and other countries.



Apple yesterday was taking reservations for in-person classes at some store locations, but as of now, all of those in-person reservations are gone and Apple is only offering virtual sessions.

                    <span>Refurbished 24-inch M1 iMac models are now available from Apple&#x27;s refurbished store in the UK, just a few months after the machines first launched in April.





Right now, Apple has one 24-inch iMac available in a pink color, which was first spotted by 9to5Mac. The machine features an 8-core CPU, 7-core GPU, and 256GB SSD and it is priced at £1,059, a £190.00 savings over the standard £1,249 price.



Refurbished stock varies based on what people have sent in for repair and replacement, and additional ‌M1‌ ‌iMac‌ models will be available in the future. Those looking for a specific build or a specific color will need to keep an eye on the store to wait for their preferred version to pop up.



All of Apple&#x27;s refurbished Macs are sold with the same one-year warranty that&#x27;s offered with a new Mac, plus they come with all manuals and accessories, including a USB-C power adapter and cable. Apple&#x27;s refurbished devices are subjected to a rigorous testing, repair, repackaging and cleaning process to make them identical to new devices.



Categories for refurbished 24-inch iMacs have also shown up in the United States, so we can expect to see the refurbished ‌iMac‌ models available in other countries in the near future.

                    <span>Apple has developed a first-of-its-kind hydration sensor designed for the Apple Watch, a company patent filing has revealed.





The patent, first spotted by Patently Apple, is titled &quot;Hydration measurement with a watch&quot; and was granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.



&quot;Traditional techniques for tracking hydration are generally invasive, expensive, or unreliable,&quot; according to Apple. This refers to existing ways of determining hydration such as single-use tests of fluid samples.



Apple&#x27;s hydration sensor takes the form of non-invasive electrodes that are placed against the skin, which it describes as a &quot;reliable and elegant&quot; solution. The sensor works by measuring the electrical properties of the Apple Watch wearer&#x27;s sweat. The patent explains:

                    <span>Mastercard last week announced that its cards will no longer be issued with the magnetic stripe by 2029, which will presumably include Apple Card.





The magnetic stripe was an early 1960s technology that allowed card information to be encoded onto magnetic tape that is laminated to the back of a card, paving the way for electronic payment terminals and chip cards. Now, Mastercard is set to be the first payments network to phase out the magnetic stripe.



Starting in 2024, Mastercard credit and debit cards will not be required to feature a magnetic stripe in most markets, including Europe. Banks in the United States will no longer be required to issue cards with a magnetic stripe in 2027. Mastercard expects that the magnetic stripe will disappear in Europe most quickly, where …</span>

                    <span>The Apple Watch Edition with titanium for the Series 6 is currently entirely unavailable for purchase on Apple&#x27;s online store, following some models being unavailable for delivery or pick-up earlier this month.





On August 1, select models of the Series 6 Edition with titanium were unavailable for delivery and/or pick-up. Now, all titanium models are unavailable for delivery or pick-up and can&#x27;t even be added to Apple&#x27;s online store bag.



The unavailability comes just weeks ahead of when we expect Apple to announce the Apple Watch Series 7 with a new design. Bloomberg&#x27;s Mark Gurman has speculated that the spotty lack of availability for the Apple Watch Edition earlier this month could entail Apple deciding to discontinue the higher-end lineup with the Series 7.



We&#x27;ve contacted Apple for comment and will let MacRumors&#x27; readers know if we hear back.

From the renders, we can see that the rear of the Apple Watch will consist of the same configuration of health sensors as the current Series 6.

“We have determined that unauthorized access to some T-Mobile data
occurred, however we have not yet determined that there is any
personal customer data involved,” T-Mobile wrote in its new
announcement. “This investigation will take some time but we are
working with the highest degree of urgency. Until we have
completed this assessment we cannot confirm the reported number of
records affected or the validity of statements made by others,”
the announcement added.
The seller told Motherboard that 100 million people had their data
compromised in the breach. In the forum post, they were offering
data on 30 million people for 6 bitcoin, or around $270,000.

                    <span>This has easily been the longest sale we&#x27;ve ever had on Acorn - since March 17th!
But if you&#x27;ve been holding out on buying it for some reason, now is the time to purchase. The 50% off sale will end Monday, August 23rd, and the price will double from $19.99 up to $39.99 USD.
The bundle discount will still be available though. So if you buy multiple copies (or multiple apps), you can save some cash. Or buy now and save even more.</span>

The jersey ads are coming; whose money will the Flyers end up taking? 
 It leaked earlier today that, despite Gary Bettman’s assurances to the contrary last year, the NHL will finally give in to the corporate gods whose money and influence rules us all and sell advertising space on NHL jerseys for the upcoming season. 
From ESPN’s report on the story: 
The league’s board of governors formally voted this month to approve jersey advertisements. The NHL had surveyed its teams and found the majority of them in favor of jersey ads. The ads will be featured in a 3-inch-by-3.5-inch rectangle, which is larger than the NBA’s 2.5-by-2.5-inch space for uniform ads.

This is, of course, the second foray into selling advertising space on the players’…</span>

So long, farewell, etc, etc. 
 The time has come, folks. Lengthy, tumultuous, and often divisive, the Robert Hagg saga has come to an end in Philadelphia. As part of the return for Buffalo in the trade that brought Rasmus Ristolainen to the Flyers, this awful and messy 2020-21 season was Hagg’s last with them, and in a lot of ways it was a solid individual final showing, and serves as a positive endnote and send-off. 



Really, we’re not being snarky, we promise. Let’s break it down, shall we?
By The Numbers


Hagg’s not one that we’ve known to put up stellar scoring numbers, but he can chip in a bit of offense when push comes to shove. That said, his scoring pace was pretty well below the range of what we’ve seen from him in the past—i…</span>

 *FOLKS! We’ve got a start date for this year’s Development Camp and it is less than two weeks away!!! Professional hockey players in Flyers jerseys on the ice in twelve days. Oh baby. [Flyers]
*In other news that we got yesterday, the Flyers will continue their partnership with the Reading Royals for a few more years. [Royals]
*Brian Elliott was a good dude, a good backup, and a fine Flyer during his tenure. We’ve nothing but good things to say as we send him off to Tampa Bay. [BSH]
*It may be mid-August but we’ve still got some pretty good free agents kicking around and, as such, some rumors kicking around them. [Sportsnet]
*And finally, Cam Atkinson is really laying it on thick and really trying to ingratiate himself with the Flyers’ fanbase. AND IT IS WORKING. [BSH]</span>

The Imperium still stands, and man are they pissed
 Eve Online’s latest player-led war has come to an end, not with a bang but with a cavernous whimper. Those on the offense have turned tail, and the defenders are putting everything they have into running them down.
The massive coalition known as PAPI campaigned for 55 weeks in a quest to destroy The Imperium, led by Alex “The Mittani” Gianturco, before losing the will to fight. Along the way, Eve Online developer CCP Games told Polygon, combatants destroyed more than $3 million worth of in-game ships and virtual infrastructure in the conflict dubbed World War Bee 2.
“This is as real as real talk gets,” said Brave Collective’s Dunk Dinkle in a live address to his fleets, in what amounted to PAPI’s conces…</span>

A bug that caused a bug
 “Hey, you’re finally awake ...” and now being catapulted to the moon thanks to a very strong bee.
Former Bethesda developer Nate Purkeypile posted a Twitter thread on Tuesday describing a notorious bug — an actual bug, at least in-game — that caused major problems during The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim’s development. Purkeypile described the introductory scene in Skyrim where the player wakes up in the back of a cart with other prisoners. It’s where the famous “You’re finally wake” meme originated — but it’s also remembered by the developer for a catastrophic collision. 
So, I have a story about the Skyrim Intro and how hard game development is.
That intro is famous now, but back then, it was just that one thing …</span>

A meticulously paced disciple of Metroid
 Axiom Verge 2 is a Metroidvania game for people who hate the term “Metroidvania.” Thomas Happ Games’ second outing has a purist’s view of the genre built by Metroid that feels like a refreshing change of pace in a sea of imitators. More importantly, while its meticulously paced exploration and upgrade loops are a little too close to its inspiration at times, it’s the way Axiom Verge 2 digs into the isolation at the heart of the Metroid series that makes it stand out.
Axiom Verge 2 strands you on the cold, mysterious world of Kiengir and cuts right to the chase. You don’t know what’s going on or what anyone else is doing here, but you’re bent on going back to Earth. So you …</span>

No release date was given, but it is expected to arrive soon
 Cyberpunk 2077’s next big patch, labeled 1.3, is on the way. On Tuesday, developer CD Projekt Red released a complete set of patch notes detailing fixes for 85 quests and gigs, plus improvements and balance changes throughout the game. The developer said the free update is headed to consoles, PC, and Stadia soon but declined to provide a release date.
In addition to the quality of life changes detailed on Monday, the 1.3 patch appears to be a substantial one. CD Projekt is also including a few of what it is calling “free DLCs.” They will take the form of additional cosmetic items for the player character, quest options, phone texts, and animations. Several of those DLCs were teased during a Twitch livestream, and a complete list will be included in the Main Menu under “Additional Content” heading.
Senior level designer Miles Tost was on hand during today’s Twitch stream to speak to the complexity of the issues that his colleagues are dealing with. He likened this and other patches to “open heart surgery.”


Cyberpunk 2077 launched in a sorry state in December, with many bugs and quality issues across every platform on which it was released. Though it quickly recouped its development costs, it was a source of embarrassment for the company’s leadership, which chose to accept the blame and apologize to fans and investors. The game was even delisted from the PlayStation Store shortly after launch, only to return in June of this year. It has yet to release for current generation consoles, including the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X, where it is only playable in compatibility mode.


Cyberpunk 2077’s most recent major patch, version 1.23, went live in June. You can read the full 1.3 patch notes at the game’s official website.</span>

Eat your heart out, Garo Yepremian
 Super Slam Dunk Touchdown, Rick Felice’s empty-the-garage mashup of sporting goods and athletes, at last launches on Xbox One on Aug. 27. This version, teased as far back as GDC 2017, brings along a new Season Mode that supports local cooperative play with up to three players.
“Now you and your friends can create a team, build a fan base, win trophies, and discover secrets, multiple endings, and 100 achievements along the way,” Felice said. An update for the Windows PC version is coming soon; it will support cloud saves, remote play, and the 100 new achievements, too.

This is Epic Games’ second crack at a hidden role mode
 Fortnite has another new Among Us-style mode and this time its a lot closer to its inspiration. Epic revealed the new mode on Tuesday, as part of Fortnite’s latest patch.
The new limited time mode is called Impostors, and it features 10 players — eight Agents and two Impostors — in each match. All 10 players are aboard The Bridge on the island (also like Among Us). The Agents are trying to complete tasks that will help them arrive at their destination safely; Impostors try to eliminate the Agents without having their identity discovered. Whenever things seem a little too suspicious, or when player’s body is found, all the remaining players convene to discuss who the Impostor might be.

                    <span>Over at In Focus, Alan Taylor is highlighting the work of Bob Wick, a photographer for the U.S. Bureau of Land Management who recently retired after 33 years of service.
In a recent interview, Bob reflected on his career. “It has been extremely fulfilling to see my photos used in BLM, across the Department, and non-profits and getting to showcase the beauty of public lands and the resources we see,” he said. “When you see things on paper in words, it’s one thing, but when you see the image of the lands that you’re affecting with that resource decision, it’s a more powerful way to communicate the message.” 
Bob added, “I like bringing joy to people with photos. A lot of people are armchair travelers and can’t go to remote places, but they get the satisfaction of seeing the beauty through my photos. I’m always happy to be able to share that beauty. I also think that images help build pride among employees as reminders of the vast and irreplaceable places that BLM manages.”

                    <span>For a Volkswagen ad campaign in 1988, Kurt Vonnegut wrote a letter of advice to people living in 2088. In the video above from 2019, Benedict Cumberbatch reads Vonnegut’s prescient letter. His main message is an environmental one: that if we don’t get our shit together, Nature will have its way with us.
The sort of leaders we need now are not those who promise ultimate victory over Nature through perseverance in living as we do right now, but those with the courage and intelligence to present to the world what appears to be Nature’s stern but reasonable surrender terms:
1. Reduce and stabilize your population.


Vonnegut: definitely a prophet. (via open culture)

                    <span>Pulitzer prize-winning photojournalist Lynsey Addario has covered Afghanistan for the past 20 years. In the Atlantic, she writes about the effect of the return to power of the oppressive Islamic-fundamentalist Taliban will have on the country’s citizens, particularly women and girls. Here she describes life under the Taliban in 2000 and 2001:
Perhaps the silence of life under the Taliban sits with me more than anything. There were very few cars, no music, no television, no telephones, and no idle conversation on the sidewalks. The dusty streets were crowded with widows who had lost their husbands in the protracted war; banned from working, their only means of survival was to beg. People were scared, indoors and out. Those who were brave enough to venture out spoke in hushed voices, for fea…</span>

                    <span>In The Hidden Melodies of Subways Around the World, the NY Times takes a look at an often overlooked aspect of transit design: the door closing sounds on the subway. My favorite door jingle is from the Paris Metro — I never knew where it came from: 
In Paris, a simple “A” note plays as the doors shut. This is also a throwback, a sound that mimics the vibrations of a mechanical part that is no longer in use on any of the system’s trains. “But for a half century Parisians and visitors alike became used to that sound, so we decided to keep it, and recorded a synthesized version,” said Song Phanekham, a communications manager for the Paris transit system. “It’s a tribute to the heritage of the Paris Metro.”
In Tokyo, each station has its own custom jingle to signal departures. In Rio de Janeiro, the subway’s door chime pays homage to bossa nova. In Vancouver, the doors still close to a three-note sound that was recorded in the 1980s on a Yamaha DX7. (“The hallmark of any mid-80s pop song,” said Ian Fisher, manager of operations planning at British Columbia Rapid Transit Company.)


You can listen to more sounds of subway doors closing in these three videos recorded by Ted Green.

                    <span>Apple today told retail staff in the United States and Europe that it is planning to bring back in-person Today at Apple classes starting on August 30, reports Bloomberg.





Classes are set to resume at most U.S. locations, but Apple&#x27;s plan to roll out in-person classes could be delayed at some Apple Store locations in areas where there is a surge in COVID-19 cases. 



With Today at Apple sessions slated to return, Apple today began accepting signups for in-store sessions on its website. Apple has not held in-person classes at its retail stores since March 2020, but the company has been offering virtual classes and the occasional outdoor class.





Apple retail stores have been reopened since earlier this year, but Apple recently reinstated a mask mandate that requires customers visiting most retail stores in the United States to wear a mask. Apple had dropped mask mandates for vaccinated customers in June, but brought them back in areas heavily impacted by the Delta variant of COVID-19.

                    <span>T-Mobile today confirmed that some of its data had been accessed without authorization in a breach that may impact more than 100 million of its users.





Over the weekend, T-Mobile began investigating a forum post that offered data from more than 100 million people. T-Mobile was not mentioned in that post, but the person selling the data told Motherboard that it had come from T-Mobile&#x27;s servers, thus leading T-Mobile to look into it. The hacker who spoke to Motherboard claimed that several T-Mobile servers had been breached.



T-Mobile has now confirmed that there was indeed unauthorized access to some customer data, but T-Mobile in a statement says it does not yet know if personal customer data has been accessed.

                    <span>Apple today released a new version of its iCloud for Windows app, with the 12.5 update adding a new ‌iCloud‌ Keychain password manager app for Windows users.





With the new password management option, those who are running Windows can access their ‌iCloud‌ Keychain passwords and can add, edit, copy and paste, delete, and look up usernames or passwords. Apple in January released an updated version of ‌iCloud‌ for Windows that hinted at the new password app, but Apple did not implement it until now.



New ‌iCloud‌ password extensions for Microsoft Edge and Windows Chrome work in tandem with the password feature, letting ‌iCloud‌ passwords be autofilled on a Windows machine just like in Safari. Usernames and passwords created for websites are automatically added to the Passwords app.





‌iCloud‌ Keychain passwords on Windows are stored in an encrypted database and are transferred to the browser extension using an encrypted channel, with passwords not stored in clear text.



‌iCloud‌ for Windows Passwords is part of ‌iCloud‌ for Windows 12.5, and Windows users can download it from the Microsoft Store. The ‌iCloud‌ for Windows app is designed to let Windows users access their ‌iCloud‌ files, photos, emails, and more from Windows devices.

As of version 6.6.1, NordVPN natively supports Apple silicon Macs, such as the MacBook Air, 13-inch MacBook Pro, Mac mini, and 24-inch iMac, which each sport the M1 chip.



Although the update started to roll out on August 3, a blog post by Nord has today announced that the 6.6.1 update is now fully available via the App Store and the NordVPN website, where the app is available for download.



While the VPN app previously ran on Apple silicon Macs via Rosetta 2, which translates apps made for Intel Macs so that they work on Macs with the ‌M1‌ chip, the new native version of the app is able to run more efficiently without the need for Rosetta 2. The new version of the app is universal, meaning that it can run on both Intel and Apple silicon architectures.



The update comes ahead of the widely-anticipated launch of new Apple silicon Macs, such as 14 and 16-inch redesigned MacBook Pro models. NordVPN version 6.6.1 is now available via the ‌App Store‌ and the NordVPN website.

Launched in January, Time to Walk are audio stories from influential people that Apple Watch users can listen to with AirPods or other wireless headphones while walking. 



Time to Walk episodes are automatically downloaded to the Apple Watch with a Fitness+ subscription, and users can start an episode directly from the Workout app. An equivalent Time to Push is available for wheelchair users.

                    <span>Apple must pay $300 million in damages to Optis Wireless Technology for infringing a handful of patents related to 4G LTE technology, a Texas jury has ruled (via Reuters).





In August 2020, a jury found that Apple had infringed five Optis wireless patents and awarded $506 million in damages, but a Texas judge vacated that award in April and ordered a new trial to focus on damages only.



US District Judge Rodney Gilstrap said the first jury was unable to determine if the amount was awarded on the FRAND terms (a fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory basis) usually required in standard essential patent cases.



PanOptis and its sister companies, Optis Wireless Technology, Optis Cellular Technology, Unwired Planet, and Unwired Planet International, are non-practicing entities that hold patents and generate revenue through patent litigation, otherwise known as patent trolls.



In a statement, Apple said: &quot;Optis makes no products and its sole business is to sue companies using patents they accumulate. We will continue to defend against their attempts to extract unreasonable payments for patents they acquire.&quot;

                    <span>Apple&#x27;s use of mini-LED panels in its forthcoming MacBook lineups will catalyze supplier investment and push the entire industry toward adoption of the display technology, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.





Like the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, Apple&#x27;s upcoming redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros are expected to feature mini-LED displays. In his latest investor note, seen by MacRumors, Kuo says this will stoke strategic supplier investment in the technology, which will allow Apple to diversify supply risk and bring down production costs.

We believe that MacBooks, not iPads, mainly drive Mini LED panel shipments. MacBook shipments have not grown much in the past few years. However, we expect MacBook shipments to grow significantly by 20% YoY, or more in 2021 and 2022, due to th…</span>

It’s impossible not to like our new #89.
 The summer of 2021, across nearly all sports worldwide, has brought about massive amounts of change for both athletes and teams. Some clubs have come back with completely different rosters, while others (such as Cleveland’s baseball team) with an entirely different name. This theme of change was really cemented when arguably the most popular athlete in the world, Lionel Messi, swapped Barcelona, a city he’s called home for over twenty years, for Paris in a move that shocked most of the world. 
But that’s enough about other sports, this is a hockey blog!
Perhaps no other team in the NHL has done more to overhaul themselves than the Philadelphia Flyers. After what was decidedly an unac…</span>

The veteran goalie was, again, pressed into more action than him or the Flyers would have liked — and the results backed it up.
 Just about nothing went right for the Flyers in terms of goaltending in 2020-21, but Brian Elliott provided dependable veteran presence despite albeit less-than-stellar results. 
And in a massive — and unexpected — surprise, Elliott ended up logging the most games and starts of any Flyers goalie last season. The 36-year-old was pressed into more duty than expected as Carter Hart struggled mightily in his third season of NHL action. 
Hart’s numbers weren’t pretty, and playing behind a Flyers defense that couldn’t keep it together for large stretches of the season didn’t help either. Those results took a toll on …</span>

The Department of Fair Employment and Housing is also suing Activision Blizzard
 League of Legends developer Riot Games has been accused by California regulators that the game maker hasn’t properly told its workers’ of their rights to participate in an ongoing investigation and lawsuit against the company. The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing, which also filed suit against Activision Blizzard in July, released a statement Monday (PDF) that said Riot has delayed informing its employees of their rights for two months.
Riot was ordered to send a notice to its employees on June 4 — to issue a memo that “advise[d] workers of their right to speak freely with the government about unlawful workplace practices” without fear of retaliation, regardless o…</span>

Horror game’s next chapter may summon Pinhead
 Horror game Dead by Daylight’s next chapter will apparently bring the Hellraiser film franchise into the fold, based on a series of teases from developer Behaviour Interactive. That will likely mean the addition of Pinhead (aka the Hell Priest, aka Xipe Totec), the lead Cenobite of Clive Barker’s sadomasochistic demon gang, as the next Dead by Daylight killer.
Behaviour Interactive’s teases have quickly been deciphered by the Dead by Daylight community. The studio sneaked the letters R-A-I-S-E into a series of tweets and images over the past week, and the letters H-E-L-L into an audio file recently posted to Discord. A video teaser released Friday also subtly hints at Hellraiser, showing staticky, VHS-style footage of flower blossoms that evokes a scene from the original Hellraiser movie from 1987.
That’s the good news. The bad news for Dead by Daylight fans is the impending loss of another license: Netflix’s Stranger Things. Behaviour Interactive announced Monday that characters Nancy Wheeler, Steve Harrington, and the Demogorgon will no longer be available for purchase as DLC as of Nov. 17. Dead by Daylight players who already have those characters will still be permitted to play with them after that date, but the Hawkins National Laboratory Underground Complex map will no longer be playable.
Behaviour is giving Stranger Things fans a chance to get that expiring content at a discount. before it goes away. Steve, Nancy, and the Demorgorgon (and cosmetic DLC for all three) are currently on sale for 50% off.
Dead by Daylight’s Stranger Things content was added to the game in September 2019. Since then, Behaviour has added licensed killers such as Pyramid Head from Silent Hill and the Nemesis T-Type from Resident Evil, alongside original characters like K-pop killer Ji-Woon Hak and creepy conjoined twins Charlotte and Victor Deshayes.</span>

 Crystal Dynamics and Square Enix dropped a detailed video about Marvel’s Avengers’ War for Wakanda expansion during a livestream on Monday. The new War Table presentation gives players a look at what Black Panther can do in Marvel’s Avengers. 
T’Challa will finally become a playable character in Marvel’s Avengers on Aug. 17, bringing the roster of playable heroes to nine. Black Panther is a melee-based character and can double jump to help him traverse the environment quickly. Unlike Kate Bishop and Clint Barton — who shared some baseline gameplay similarities — Black Panther is a completely unique hero.

Sledgehammer Games’ new Call of Duty is almost here
 Activision released a new teaser trailer for Call of Duty: Vanguard, officially announcing the next game in the series after a series of leaks. Players will get a first look at this year’s Call of Duty game on Aug. 19, during a special event inside Call of Duty: Warzone called the Battle of Verdansk.
The first trailer for Call of Duty: Vanguard opens with a montage of battlefields that centers on World War II. There’s a sniper’s nest that appears to be in or near Russia, a desert battlefield, a German forest, and a beach littered with destroyed aircraft. Each one of these areas features a face somewhere in the landscape, and sometimes a name (Petrova in Cyrillic, Sgt. Kingsley), hinting at characters that will …</span>

Kratos’ voice actor on how legacy factors into his T’Challa performance
 “My mom’s always right,” Christopher Judge told me in an interview ahead of his starring role as King T’Challa, the Black Panther, in Marvel’s Avengers’ upcoming War for Wakanda expansion.
Crystal Dynamics and Square Enix announced that Judge — known as the voice of Kratos in 2018’s God of War and as Teal’c in Stargate SG-1 — would play Black Panther in an Entertainment Weekly interview in mid-July. In the article, Judge revealed that he initially turned down the opportunity to voice T’Challa, believing that nobody could do the role justice after Chadwick Boseman. But his mother, as well as his children, convinced him otherwise. On the other side of the experience, Judge t…</span>

Patch 1.3 is expected soon
 Cyberpunk 2077’s next big patch, labeled 1.3, is expected to launch soon. On Monday, developer CD Projekt Red teased a trio of changes which should be exciting for dedicated players. It also includes a fix to an early game quest that has been frustrating players for a while now. The in-fiction announcement was made on social media, and includes a fairly obtuse description of what to expect. Here’s the gist of what’s on the way.
First, the minimap while driving appears to show slightly more of the road ahead of you than it did before. That should make navigating — especially at high speeds — a lot easier. 


Second, the early game quest that takes place in the Clouds club has been altered slightly. Previously, players were presented with the choice of hiring one of two different sex workers, named Angel (male presenting) and Skye (female presenting). However, their pictures were removed from view prior to giving players the option to choose. With patch 1.3, CD Projekt will now show the image of both sex workers on screen while the dialogue option is available, giving players a better idea of which gender expression they’ll be intimate with over the course of the night.


Finally, Cyberpunk 2077’s 1.3 patch also lowers the cost to respec your character’s perks. Previously, players had to visit a ripperdoc and purchase an item called Tabula e-Rasa for 100,000 eurobucks. With the next patch you can simply pay 13,200 eurobucks right from their character menu.
“For our players, this feature will mean safer experimentation with builds,” CD Projekt Red gameplay designer Katarína said in a blog post. “It is easily accessible and affordable for everyone, so there is no need to hesitate while investing in particular perks.”
Monday’s announcement went on to say that a full list of changes is on the way. CD Projekt promises more details on Aug. 17 during a live Twitch stream.
Cyberpunk 2077’s most recent major patch, version 1.23, went live in June.</span>

Diana Prince will join Batman and Superman in the battle royale 
 Fortnite is getting a little more heroic with the addition of a Wonder Woman outfit in an upcoming update. 
Diana Prince’s outfit will come with a battle armor variant as well as her iconic regular costume. Of course, the outfit won’t be the only cosmetic for the Amazonian hero. She’ll also be released alongside the Athena’s Battleaxe gathering tool, the DC Trinity loading screen, where she poses with Batman and Superman, the Golden Eagle Wings glider, and the Diana’s Mantle back bling. 
The new skin will make Diana Prince the latest member of the Justice League to join Fortnite. Many other heroes have found a place on the Fortnite island in the last several years, including several others from DC, like Beast Boy and Raven, as well as Marvel heroes like Black Widow, and the rest of the Avengers. 
Fortnite’s Wonder Woman skin will be released on Aug. 19. To celebrate the release of the new outfit, Epic will also host the Wonder Woman Cup tournament and give players a few challenges to complete, all related to the Amazonian warrior.</span>

Arc System Works’ second DLC fighter is almost here
 Jack-O’ Valentine is coming to Guilty Gear Strive at the end of August, developer Arc System Works announced Sunday. Jack-O’ will be the second playable fighter included as part of the fighting game’s first season pass, following alien-coffin-wielding military man Goldlewis Dickinson’s release in July.
Guilty Gear fans are already quite familiar with Jack-O’. She was added as a playable character in 2016’s Guilty Gear Xrd Revelator, and in Strive, she’ll fight using her jack-o’-lantern-themed ball and chain, and a trio of summonable minions. You can see her in action in the trailer above.


Jack-O’ is coming to Guilty Gear Strive on Aug. 27 for players who own the game’s $29.99 season pass. Everyone else can download her starting Aug. 30, for $6.99. She’s one of five characters planned for Guilty Gear Strive’s first season pass. One more DLC fighter is planned for release in 2021, with two more coming in 2022.
Guilty Gear fans can also look forward to Baiken from Arc System Works’ fighting game series coming to SNK’s Samurai Shodown as part of season pass 3.


Guilty Gear Strive is available now on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC.</span>

In his latest weekly Power On newsletter, Gurman says that much like last year, Apple will hold multiple events this coming fall, with the first likely being in September for the iPhone 13. Last year, due to the global health crisis and production constraints, the iPhone 12 lineup was not announced until October. The 2020 September event, rather than focusing on new iPhones, showcased new Apple Watches, iPads, and services.

                    <span>HBO Max will release a completely rebuilt Apple TV app by the end of the year to overcome a variety of issues users have experienced with the current version, according to a new report.





Shortly after Warnermedia removed its HBO Max offering from ‌Apple TV‌ Channels in May, an update to its subsequently released tvOS app essentially broke several features of the service.



In June, HBO Max dropped the native tvOS video player in favor of a custom video player, which introduced issues with fast-forwarding and rewinding video in the app.



Recognizing its mistake, HBO quickly reinstated the native tvOS video player UI. However, problems with playback control remained, while users have continued to report other issues to do with subtitles and audio description.

School-based teachers and staff, central office, regular vendors and network employees who aren’t fully vaccinated or can’t provide documentation of an exemption by the deadline will be ineligible to work for the district until they submit proof of inoculation or exemption.
Until the Oct. 15 cutoff, staff who aren’t vaccinated will be required to take a COVID-19 test at least once a week, the district said. As of August, 68 percent of district employees have been fully vaccinated, according to self-reported district data. Among teachers, that rate is higher, with 82 percent reporting that they are fully vaccinated.

A bit of housekeeping is complete. 
 We’re deep into August and things are pretty quiet on the hockey news front, at least for the Flyers, but they still have a few loose ends that needed (or might need) tying up, and they knocked out one of those today. 
The Flyers announced this afternoon that they’ve signed their 2021 second round pick Samu Tuomaala to a three-year entry level contract. Tuomaala spent the 2020-21 season with Kärpät’s U20 team, where he put up 31 points (15 goals and 16 assists) in 30 regular season games, and four points (1G, 4A) in five playoff games. He also represented Finland in the U18 World Championship, and he recorded 11 points (5G, 6A) in seven games, leading his team in scoring. 
In short: he’s good, gang! Here’s what Flyers’ AGM Brent Flahr and Director of European Scouting Joakim Grundberg had to say about him. 
“He’s a guy we targeted. We kind of thought he would probably go at the end of the first or somewhere in the 20s and he fell. A real talented winger. Great skater. Real dynamic speed. Loves to shoot the puck. Talented kid. He’s going to take a little time to get stronger and put on a little weight. A talented kid that has real good offensive upside.” - Flahr
“Obviously very excited getting him. He was rated as a first round talent. We were able to get him in the middle of the second round, so we’re really excited about that. To us, he has elite speed and high skill. Very good shot. High-offensive upside. There’s things he’s got to work on like his overall game and obviously getting stronger. We’re really excited. We see a lot of upside there.” - Grundberg
Now, it may still be a little while before we see Tuomaala make the jump over to North America. He’s slated to join Kärpät (Liiga) next season, and this ELC can slide to allow that to happen. But he’s locked in with the Flyers all the same, and it’s a bit of housekeeping taken care of.</span>

                    <span>For The Atlantic, Katherine Wu writes about the difficulty of communicating how vaccines work and how they protect individuals and communities from disease: Vaccines Are Like Sunscreen… No, Wait, Airbags… No, Wait…
Unfortunately, communal benefit is harder to define, harder to quantify, and harder to describe than individual protection, because “it’s not the way Americans are used to thinking about things,” Neil Lewis, a behavioral scientist and communications expert at Cornell, told me. That’s in part because communal risk isn’t characteristic of the health perils people in wealthy countries are accustomed to facing: heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer. Maybe that’s part of why we gravitate toward individual-focused comparisons. Slipping into a pandemic-compatible, population-based frame of mind is a big shift. In the age of COVID-19, “there’s been a lot of focus on the individual,” Lewis told me. That’s pretty at odds “with how infection works.”


As someone who has struggled with analogizing the virus &amp; vaccines, I was nodding my head a lot while reading this. Something I’ve noticed in recent years that Wu didn’t get into is that readers desire precision in metaphors and analogies, even though metaphor is — by definition! — not supposed to be taken literally. People seem much more interested in taking analogies apart, identifying what doesn’t work, and discarding them rather than — more generously and constructively IMO — using them as the author intended to better understand the subject matter. The perfect metaphor doesn’t exist because then it wouldn’t be a metaphor.

                    <span>In an issue of his newsletter, The Convivial Society, L.M. Sacasas posed 41 questions that we should ask ourselves about technologies to help us “draw out the moral or ethical implications of our tools”. Here are a few of the questions:
3. How will the use of this technology affect my experience of time?


Sacasas recently joined Ezra Klein on his podcast to talk through some of the answers to these questions for certain technologies.
EZRA KLEIN: I’m gonna group the next set together. So what was required of other human beings, of other creatures, of the earth, so that I might be able to use this technology? When you ask that, when you think of that, what comes to mind?
MICHAEL SACASAS: So I recently wrote a piece, and its premise was that sometimes we think of the internet, of digital life, as being immaterial, existing somewhere out in the ether, in the cloud, with these metaphors that kind of suggest that it doesn’t really have a material footprint. But the reality of course — I think as most of us are becoming very aware — is that it very much has a material reality that may begin in a mine where rare earth metals are being extracted in inhumane working conditions at great cost to the local environment.
But that’s very far removed from my comfortable experience of the tablet on my couch in the living room. And so with regards to the earth, the digital realm depends upon material resources that need to be collected. It depends on the energy grid. It leaves a footprint on the environment.
And so we tend not to think about that by the time that it gets to us and looks so shiny and clean and new, and connects us to this world that isn’t physically necessarily located anywhere in our experience. And so I think it is important for us to think about the labor, the extraction cost on the environment, that go into providing us with the kind of world that we find so amusing and interesting and comfortable.

                    <span>One of the many effects of human-driven climate change is that, on average, the bodies of animals are getting smaller — birds, fish, deer, frogs, rodents, insects. And these changes could have large and unpredictable consequences.
“That’s the problem with human-driven climate change. It’s the rate of change that’s just orders of magnitude faster than what the natural world has had to deal with in the past. Size is really important to survival, and you can’t just change that indefinitely without consequence. For one thing, I don’t think it’s feasible that species are going to be able to continue to get smaller and maintain things like a migration from one hemisphere to another.”
And since smaller bodies can hold fewer eggs, they result in fewer offspring, and a lower population size in the long run. For amphibians who need to keep their skin wet in order to breathe, shrinking can mean higher chances of drying out in a drought because their bodies absorb and hold smaller quantities of water.
But the more concerning consequences have to do with how this could destabilize relationships between species. Because shrinking plays out at different rates for different species, predators might have to eat more and more of shrinking prey, for example, throwing a finely-tuned ecosystem off balance.

                    <span>Apple in iOS 15 is taking another step toward replacing the traditional wallet, adding several new features to its digital Wallet app that will allow people to leave their physical cards and keys behind.





This guide highlights all of the new features that are coming to the Wallet app in ‌iOS 15‌, but it&#x27;s worth noting that many of them rely on third-party companies and services adopting Wallet support.



Digital IDs


In the United States, Apple is working with state authorities to allow iPhone users to add their driver&#x27;s license or state ID card to the Wallet app, which would allow digital IDs to be used in lieu of a physical ID card.





Apple is also working with the TSA to allow digital ID cards to be used at TSA checkpoints, with the digital ID able to be shown…</span>

Apple&#x27;s plan to detect known Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) images stored in iCloud Photos has been particularly controversial and has prompted concerns from some security researchers, the non-profit Electronic Frontier Foundation, and others about the system potentially being abused by governments as a form of mass surveillance.

                    <span>Apple Arcade recently surpassed 200 games available on the service, and several new titles are coming soon, including Tetris Beat, Baldo, Asphalt 8: Airborne, Layton&#x27;s Mystery Journey, Zen Pinball Party, Zookeeper World, MasterChef: Let&#x27;s Cook, and more.





Another game can be added to the list, as Castlevania: Grimoire of Souls from well-known Japanese company Konami is set to launch exclusively on Apple Arcade, across the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV. Mobile gaming enthusiasts may remember that the game had soft launched on the App Store in Canada back in 2019, but it was removed less than a year later. No specific release date has been announced for its Apple Arcade return.



The side-scrolling action game will feature a lineup of iconic characters from the popular gothic video game series, including Alucard, Simon Belmont, Charlotte, Shanoa, Maria, and more to come. Players will be tasked with blasting their way through Dracula&#x27;s army using a variety of attacks, weapons, and unique character moves.



The original trailer for the game from 2019 can be watched below.






In addition, a trio of Apple Arcade games have recently been updated, with a new mini-game and new quests added to The Oregon Trail, five new songs added to Taiko no Tatsujin Pop Tap Beat, and 200 new levels added in Simon&#x27;s Cat - Story Time.



Priced at $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year, Apple Arcade is a subscription-based service that provides access to a catalog of over 200 games without ads or in-app purchases across the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV, with additional titles added periodically. A free one-month trial is available for first-time subscribers.

                    <span>The Connectivity Standards Alliance, which includes Apple, Google, and Amazon, has announced it will delay the launch of its &quot;Matter&quot; standard, which aims to unify the smart home ecosystem of the largest tech giants, according to a blog post by the Alliance posted today (via Stacey on IoT).





&quot;Matter,&quot; announced last year and formerly known as &quot;Project CHIP,&quot; is a unified IP-based connectivity that aims to make a standard universal protocol for developers to build Internet of Things devices. The Alliance had previously sought to roll out the standard in the latter portion of this year, but it&#x27;s now been delayed until 2022. 



The group says that &quot;Matter&quot; is complete in regards to its feature set. However, according to the blog post, it still needs to continue working on the program in which developers can apply for certification and finish the SDK for developers to use.



Several smart home accessory makers have signed onto using Matter as a standard protocol, including Amazon, ASSA ABLOY, Comcast, Espressif Systems, Eve Systems, Google, Grundfos Holding A/S, Huawei, Infineon Technologies, LEEDARSON, Legrand, Nanoleaf, and others.

                    <span>LG&#x27;s first-ever OLED monitor has officially come to market, with the company&#x27;s new 32-inch UltraFine Display OLED Pro Monitor now available to order through B&amp;H Photo Video. Pricing is set at $3,999 in the United States.





Designed for creative professionals, LG says the monitor&#x27;s 4K OLED panel provides exceptional color accuracy. However, the technology comes at a steep price compared to LG&#x27;s standard UltraFine 4K monitor with LCD technology, which is available for $699.95 through Apple&#x27;s online store in the United States.



Key tech specs of the monitor include HDR10, 99% coverage of the Adobe RGB and DCI-P3 color gamuts, a 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio, a 60Hz refresh rate, 250 nits peak brightness, pixel dimming technology, a 1ms response time, and a 178º viewing angle. The monitor can be connected to a compatible Mac with a single USB-C cable, with 90W pass-through charging for any MacBook Air or MacBook Pro.






Other connectivity on the rear of the monitor includes one HDMI port, two DisplayPort 1.4 ports, three USB-A ports, and a 3.5mm headphone jack.



The monitor is currently out of stock on LG&#x27;s website, but can be ordered from B&amp;H Photo Video.

                    <span>Eve Spectrum bills itself as the first crowd-developed monitor, and it was in the works for quite some time ahead of launch. The Eve Spectrum is now shipping out and available, so we thought we&#x27;d test it out to see if it&#x27;s worth picking up.




Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos.


There are three versions of the 27-inch Spectrum display. For $459, you can get a Spectrum QHD with a 144Hz refresh rate, while a 240Hz version is available for $609. A 4K version is also available with a 144Hz refresh rate, and this top-of-the-line version costs $799. The Spectrum stand for those who aren&#x27;t using a VESA mount is an additional $99.



MacRumors videographer Dan Barbera has been testing the 4K 144Hz version, and he found the design to be minimal, clean, and subtle, and for video editing work, it performed well.



Colors were accurate and natural and viewing angles were solid, but there is some light bleed with blacks and contrast doesn&#x27;t quite measure up to some other displays at this price point.



Gameplay was smooth thanks to the high refresh rate, and the high contrast and peak brightness made games look great. There were times, however, that the video feed would die, and it&#x27;s unclear if the issue was a cable or a port.



The Eve Spectrum comes equipped with a single DisplayPort port, two HDMI 2.1 ports, two USB-C ports, and one USB-A port, along with an audio port. There&#x27;s no Thunderbolt support, but with a 100W USB-C port, it can charge even the 16-inch MacBook Pro.



There are few gaming monitors with these specs and HDMI 2.1, so for those who need these features, the Spectrum may be worth checking out. Make sure to watch the full video up above to see it in action.

                    <span>Apple&#x27;s senior vice president of software engineering, Craig Federighi, has today defended the company&#x27;s controversial planned child safety features in a significant interview with The Wall Street Journal, revealing a number of new details about the safeguards built into Apple&#x27;s system for scanning users&#x27; photos libraries for Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM).





Federighi admitted that Apple had handled last week&#x27;s announcement of the two new features poorly, relating to detecting explicit content in Messages for children and CSAM content stored in iCloud Photos libraries, and acknowledged the widespread confusion around the tools:
It&#x27;s really clear a lot of messages got jumbled pretty badly in terms of how things were understood. We wish that this would&#x27;ve come out a little more…</span>

                    <span>Apple may be forced to remove the Lightning port from the iPhone in favor of USB-C, according to legislation expected be presented by the European Commission next month, Reuters reports.





The legislation would establish a common charging port for all mobile phones and other relevant devices in all European Union countries. The move is expected to primarily affect Apple, since many popular Android devices already feature USB-C ports.



In 2018, the European Commission tried to reach a final resolution on the issue but it failed to come into law. At the time, Apple warned that forcing a common charging port on the industry would stifle innovation and create electronic waste as consumers were forced to switch to new cables.





	
The EU Wants All Phones to Work With Interoperable Chargers, Here’s What That Means for Apple&#x27;s Lightning Port






A European Commission impact assessment study conducted in 2019 found that half of all charging cables sold with mobile phones had a USB micro-B connector, 29 percent had a USB-C connector, and 21 percent had a Lightning connector. The study suggested five options for a common charger, with various options that cover ports on devices and ports on power adapters.



Last year, the debate was reignited as the European Parliament overwhelmingly voted in favor of a common charger, citing less environmental waste and user convenience as the main benefits.



The executive branch of the European Union is currently drafting the legislation, according to sources speaking to Reuters, which is expected to be presented next month.

                    <span>Apple employees are now joining the choir of individuals raising concerns over Apple&#x27;s plans to scan iPhone users&#x27; photo libraries for CSAM or child sexual abuse material, reportedly speaking out internally about how the technology could be used to scan users&#x27; photos for other types of content, according to a report from Reuters.





According to Reuters, an unspecified number of Apple employees have taken to internal Slack channels to raise concerns over CSAM detection. Specifically, employees are concerned that governments could force Apple to use the technology for censorship by finding content other than CSAM. Some employees are worried that Apple is damaging its industry-leading privacy reputation.

                    <span>More on the thinking behind Glass:
Om: Tom, tell us a bit about yourself and what prompted you to
start Glass.
Tom Watson: I’ve been designing digital products for over 20
years now. I was an early Product Designer at Facebook (2009-2013)
and Pinterest (2013-2018). I saw the tradeoffs firsthand around
having to design for engagement versus people using the product.
That experience made me want to build something different. […]
We intentionally didn’t raise venture capital. We didn’t want to
make the compromises that I saw earlier in my career. With no
outside capital and subscriptions, we’re able to forgo
advertising, engagement algorithms, pivots to video, and several
other things we feel would compromise the product and community
we’re trying to build.
Om: Who are you focused on as a primary customer — a professional
photographer? A pro-am photographer? Or amateurs?
TW: It’s for photographers — amateur or professional. That can be
anything from someone just starting with their iPhone or someone
with tens of thousands of dollars worth of equipment. We believe
great photography can come from anywhere and anyone. We hope to
build a community for all levels of photographers to learn, grow,
and generally nerd out about photography.

                    <span>Glass is a new photo sharing app/community:
We want you to adore Glass, not become addicted to it. We’ve
created a distraction-free app focused on one thing — your
photos. […] All the social network features you’d expect with
none of the dark patterns driving engagement. Build relationships
with and learn from other photographers while enjoying a
chronological feed and no public counts. […]
Glass is subscription-based, which means we won’t sell your data
or pollute your feed with ads. We don’t answer to outside
investors or advertisers, just members of our community.
$4.99 monthly or $49.99 yearly $29.99 yearly (at launch)
keeps Glass rolling.
Is it just like OG Instagram? No. Glass is doing its own thing in a bunch of subtle ways. But it’s certainly a lot more like Instagram circa 2010 than Instagram is today. In spirit, it feels a lot like the early days of Flickr. I’ve been beta testing Glass for a few months and it’s an absolutely lovely, exquisitely-designed app. It’s downright serene scrolling through my Glass timeline, something that I haven’t been able to say about Instagram in many years.
Currently iOS only — in fact, I believe the only way to sign in is through Sign In With Apple. There’s a wait list to get in now that they’re out of beta; if Glass intrigues you, I encourage you to sign up now.

                    <span>Clarifying interview, with at least one bit of news: Federighi says the heretofore unspecified “threshold” for CSAM fingerprint matches that must be reached before an iCloud account is flagged (or even can be flagged, thanks to how the shared-key cryptography is implemented) is “on the order of 30 known child pornographic images”. Right around the 3:00 mark:
“And if, and only if you meet a threshold of something on the order
of 30 known child pornographic images matching, only then does
Apple know anything about your account and know anything about
those images.”
There’s also a WSJ news story (News+ link), co-bylined by Stern and Tim Higgins, in which Federighi emphasizes that the database of CSAM fingerprints is auditable:
Beyond creating a system that isn’t scanning through all of a
user’s photos in the cloud, Mr. Federighi pointed to another
benefit of placing the matching process on the phone directly.
“Because it’s on the [phone], security researchers are constantly
able to introspect what’s happening in Apple’s [phone] software,”
he said. “So if any changes were made that were to expand the
scope of this in some way — in a way that we had committed to not
doing — there’s verifiability, they can spot that that’s
happening.”
Critics have said the database of images could be corrupted, such
as political material being inserted. Apple has pushed back
against that idea. During the interview, Mr. Federighi said the
database of images is constructed through the intersection of
images from multiple child-safety organizations — not just the
National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. He added that
at least two “are in distinct jurisdictions.” Such groups and an
independent auditor will be able to verify that the database
consists only of images provided by those entities, he said.

The young prospect that made a huge impact last season is staying off the ice for a while.
 This is going to be a significant year for Philadelphia Flyers prospects, but one of them is going to be sitting on the sidelines for potentially quite a while.
Announced by the team on Friday, 2020 fourth-round pick Zayde Wisdom has undergone successful shoulder surgery this summer and is out indefinitely.
Injury update: 2020 NHL Draft pick (4th round, 94th overall) Zayde Wisdom had successful shoulder surgery today in Philadelphia. Wisdom appeared in 28 games last season with the @LVPhantoms (AHL), recording 18 points (7g-11a). He is out indefinitely. pic.twitter.com/rkXfsnxCv1

The former second overall selection has had his fair share of troubles in Philadelphia, but it was never really a fit, especially last season.
 Nolan Patrick’s entire existence as a member of the Philadelphia Flyers has been a weird one. With overcorrection and hope that he would be worthy of his second overall status, or just plain hatred towards him for suffering through multiple injuries and not being the answer for an aging core of forwards—even at just 22 years old he was seen as washed up.
Well, now we don’t really have to worry about him anymore, as he was eventually shipped off to the Vegas Golden Knights after being a part of the package for top-pairing defenseman Ryan Ellis. Who knew that his draft pedigree could carry him that …</span>

                    <span>On Monday, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an arm of the United Nations, published its first major report on climate science in seven years, warning that climate change is “widespread, rapid, and intensifying” and urging immediate, large-scale emissions reductions.

The developers sneaked in a reference to the game 
 A new victory scene from Call of Duty: Warzone’s recently launched season hints at 2021’s Call of Duty game, according to footage posted online on Friday. This year’s entry in the franchise, which is currently in development at Sledgehammer Games, will be called Call of Duty: Vanguard and send players back to World War II, according to images of the game that leaked earlier this week.
The victory scene is new for season 5 of Call of Duty: Warzone and Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, which went live on Friday. The cutscene shows the winning team being extracted from the battlefield — that is until, a red-haired woman in a Soviet World War II uniform shoots the last player with an old-school wooden sniper rifle. The soldier’s attire and weapon seem to support the aforementioned leaks, which suggested that 2021’s Call of Duty game will take place in WWII. 
What’s more is that the character herself resembles a person depicted in leaked images of Vanguard — further seeming to confirm prior information, and that the victory scene is a reference to the upcoming game. 
The leaks also contained details on Vanguard’s Ultimate Edition and information about three bundles for the game. However, they didn’t mention a release date for Vanguard. 
Call of Duty publisher Activision Blizzard faces wide-ranging allegations that it maintains a toxic workplace environment that is particularly hostile to women, pays them less, and subjects them to sexual harassment, and that perpetrators are not meaningfully punished, according to a lawsuit filed by California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing in July. You can read more about the allegations against Activision Blizzard in Polygon’s explainer.</span>

Get four weapons in Trials this week
 Trials of Osiris is back in Destiny 2. Saint-14 is the new Trials vendor and announcer, and players can find him and his wares in the Tower Hangar every Friday at reset.
Each week, the Trials of Osiris map changes, as do the rewards for winning a certain number of matches. The rewards are consistent across all players, although each player’s weapon roll will differ.
Here are the guaranteed Trials of Osiris rewards this week:
Map: Endless Vale
3 wins — Eye of Sol, Kinetic sniper rifle
5 wins — Igneous Hammer, Solar hand cannon
7 wins — The Messenger, Kinetic pulse rifle
Flawless — Shayura’s Wrath (Adept), Void submachine gun
Note: As of Season of Arrivals, players can complete the End Game weekly bounty — which just needs Trials match completions (wins give more progress) — to earn the three-win reward.
Players who manage to reach seven wins without a single loss can go to the Lighthouse social space — this is called a Flawless run. The Lighthouse offers additional rewards for players, some of which are unique, like a special emblem. Players who reach the Lighthouse also earn a special armor glow for any of their Trials of Osiris armor, which lasts for the remainder of the weekend.</span>

Head to the EDZ for some Exotics
 The weekly Exotic item merchant, Xur, hangs out in random locations around the world of Destiny. In Destiny 2, he can appear all over the map, as well as inside the Tower. This week, you can find Xur in the EDZ, in the Winding Cove, standing on cliff by a Fallen Ketch.

Xur’s inventory this week consists of the following:
Prometheus Lens, Solar trace rifle: 29 Legendary Shards
Graviton Forfeit, Hunter helmet: 23 Legendary Shards

                    <span>Usually when I post these sorts of non-narrative videos — in this case, a series of creative stop motion vignettes featuring matchsticks made by Tomohiro Okazaki — I say something to the effect of “I could have watched this all day” or “I wish this video were longer” because they’re often quite short. Well, this one is seven and a half minutes long and I still wish it had gone on for longer. Ok sure, you get the point after awhile, but each successive animation is just as inventive than the last that it kept me hooked.

                    <span>This is an extraordinary story by Jennifer Senior about the various ways in which members of a family grieved the death of a beloved son who died in NYC on 9/11: What Bobby McIlvaine Left Behind.
Early on, the McIlvaines spoke to a therapist who warned them that each member of their family would grieve differently. Imagine that you’re all at the top of a mountain, she told them, but you all have broken bones, so you can’t help each other. You each have to find your own way down.
It was a helpful metaphor, one that may have saved the McIlvaines’ marriage. But when I mentioned it to Roxane Cohen Silver, a psychology professor at UC Irvine who’s spent a lifetime studying the effects of sudden, traumatic loss, she immediately spotted a problem with it: “That suggests everyone will make it down…</span>

                    <span>I’m just going to go ahead and say it right up front here: if you had certain expectations in May/June about how the pandemic was going to end in the US (or was even thinking it was over), you need to throw much of that mindset in the trash and start again because the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 has changed the game. I know this sucks to hear,1 but Delta is sufficiently different that we need to reset and stop assuming we can solely rely on the vaccines to stop Covid-19 from spreading. Ed Yong’s typically excellent piece on how delta has changed the pandemic’s endgame is helping me wrap my head around this.
But something is different now — the virus. “The models in late spring were pretty consistent that we were going to have a ‘normal’ summer,” Samuel Scarpino of the Rockefeller Foundatio…</span>

A trusted member of her community, Oliver teams up with county commissioner Drucilla Russ-Jackson to call &amp; go door-to-door, talking with people one-on-one, cajoling and telling personal stories of loss to get folks signed up for a mobile vaccination clinic.
In the film, Oliver and Russ-Jackson arrange for a hospital to set up a pop-up site in Panola, but the site will only be established if they get at least forty people to sign up to take the vaccine.

                    <span>Apple in iOS 15 is making several improvements to Spotlight, aka the universal search feature that can be accessed on the iPhone or iPad&#x27;s Home Screen with a downward swipe.





Spotlight is a one-stop resource for accessing everything you might want to find on an iOS device, and in ‌iOS 15‌, it&#x27;s better than ever. This guide highlights all of the new features that are coming to Spotlight with Apple&#x27;s latest update.



Rich Search Results


Apple&#x27;s Siri knowledge database has been expanded and the Spotlight feature now supports rich search results, so you can get more information than before directly from the Spotlight interface.

The images of the new macOS iWork icons for Pages, Numbers, and Keynote are relatively low-resolution given the small size they are displayed at for sharing purposes, but it&#x27;s clear they are a mix of the flat design and solid background colors of the iWork icons first introduced with iOS 7 and the latest macOS versions introduced for Big Sur in November 2020 that feature more photorealistic elements.

                    <span>Apple today seeded a new public beta of the macOS 12 Monterey beta to public beta testers, allowing non-developers to test the new macOS Monterey software ahead of its public release. The fourth beta comes two weeks after Apple released the third macOS Monterey public beta.





Public beta testers can download the macOS 12 Monterey update from the Software Update section of the System Preferences app after installing the proper profile from Apple&#x27;s beta software website.



‌macOS Monterey‌ introduces quite a few major updates for the macOS operating system. Universal Control, for example, lets a single mouse, trackpad, and keyboard be used across multiple Mac or iPad devices, and it&#x27;s now possible to AirPlay directly to a Mac from an iPhone, ‌iPad‌, or even another Mac.

                    <span>Apple will likely unveil its next-generation iPhones next month, and ahead of time, Taiwanese research firm TrendForce has outlined its expectations for the devices.





TrendForce said its latest investigations indicate that some of the notable hardware upgrades for the iPhone 13 models will include a faster and more power efficient 5nm+ chip that will presumably be named the A15 Bionic, support for mmWave 5G in additional countries outside the United States, and space-saving internal circuitry that will likely allow for larger batteries inside the devices. All of these features have been rumored previously.



As for pricing, TrendForce believes the iPhone 13 series will be priced similarly as the iPhone 12 series, assuming that Apple is able to effectively control manufacturing costs, due to the lack of many significant hardware upgrades. While the iPhone 12 series was announced in October last year, likely due to pandemic-related delays, the research firm said Apple will return to a September release for the iPhone 13 series this year.



TrendForce said iPhone shipments will likely maintain a growth trajectory in the third quarter of 2021 following the launch of the iPhone 13 series.

                    <span>Today on Verizon you can bundle Apple&#x27;s Magic Keyboard for 11-inch iPad Pro and the Apple Pencil 2, and get a total of $128.70 off both products. Verizon has been discounting these accessories separately for a few weeks, but now with this bundle you can save even more.



Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.

                    <span>Apple has teamed up with singer Billie Eilish on a new short film to promote Apple Music&#x27;s recently launched Spatial Audio feature.






The 90-second video, created by Apple Music in close collaboration with Eilish, mashes up the songs &quot;Getting Older&quot; and &quot;GOLDWING&quot; from the artist&#x27;s latest album &quot;Happier Than Ever.&quot; Eilish is seen singing in front of a vanity mirror, and as the song transitions, her reflections start to multiply in additional mirrors surrounding her, which Apple said is a metaphor meant to represent what it&#x27;s like to listen to Spatial Audio.



Apple said Spatial Audio takes the listening experience of the new album to new heights, bringing dimensionality to Eilish&#x27;s vocal performance.



Based on Dolby Atmos, Spatial Audio provides a surround sound experience, making songs sound like they are coming from all around you. Thousands of Apple Music songs have been made available in Spatial Audio since the feature rolled out in June, including Lady Gaga&#x27;s &quot;Rain on Me&quot; and Kanye West&#x27;s &quot;Black Skinhead,&quot; and Eilish&#x27;s new &quot;Happier Than Ever&quot; album can also be listened to in the immersive audio format.

                    <span>Foxconn, one of Apple&#x27;s largest suppliers, has said it will begin construction of all-electric vehicle plants in the United States and Thailand this year, with hopes of them being operational by 2023, according to a report from Nikkei Asia.





From the report: 

Foxconn, the world&#x27;s largest contract electronics producer, on Thursday said it will build electric vehicle manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and Thailand next year, as the key iPhone assembler accelerates efforts to catch the rising EV wave to offset the slowing smartphone industry.



Foxconn has already ruled out Mexico as a location but is in negotiations with three states in the U.S. to build its first EV manufacturing plant in North America, Nikkei Asia has learned. Those include Wisconsin, which just agreed with Foxconn to amend its former plan of investing $10 billion in the state -- a promise Foxconn made in 2017.
At first, Foxconn will use the U.S. plant to build vehicles for its client Fisker, although there could be a potential expansion to serve Apple in the future.



Apple is widely reported to be working on its own vehicle and is thought to be looking for third-party companies to help it launch the Apple Car. One report vaguely referenced Foxconn as a potential candidate for the ‌Apple Car‌&#x27;s production, but Apple is also looking at other possible suppliers. Apple is reportedly committed to ensuring that the battery used in the ‌Apple Car‌ is produced in the United States, but Foxconn does not produce batteries.

                    <span>Apple researchers have discovered that wearable devices like AirPods can be used to estimate a user&#x27;s respiratory rate, opening up another potential avenue in biometric health sensor smarts.





Respiratory rate (RR) is a clinical metric used to assess overall health and physical fitness. In a paper highlighted on the Apple Machine Learning Research website and spotted by MyHealthyApple, researchers found that &quot;wearable headphones&quot; are able to pick up audible inhalations and exhalations during exertion using the device&#x27;s on-board microphones.



According to the paper, the appeal of remote estimation of RR is that it offers a cost-effective method of tracking disease progression and cardio-respiratory fitness over time using &quot;accessible, aesthetically acceptable,&quot; non-invasive w…</span>

                    <span>Zoom has introduced a new feature called Focus Mode that&#x27;s designed to prevent students from distracting each other during virtual classrooms. 





When enabled, Focus Mode allows the teacher or lecturer taking the class to see all the students, while each student can only see the teacher. 



The setting can be activated at any time by the teleconferencing host, so for example it could be turned on for lecture periods to reduce distractions from students&#x27; video feeds and then turned off for group discussion.



Focus Mode is available on the free desktop Zoom client, therefore lending itself to other uses, like business meetings, family gatherings and so on. 





Zoom announced the new feature in a blog post offering other back-to-school tips to get children prepared for virtual or hybrid learning. Version 5.7.5 of Zoom for Mac is available to download from the Zoom website.

                    <span>Apple is reportedly changing up the way it produces camera modules for its iPhone, now opting to individually produce each of the camera lenses separately, rather than procure them together and have them pre-assembled, according to a report from The Elec.





The report notes that up to last year, Apple&#x27;s ‌iPhone‌ camera lenses were produced by its suppliers LG InnoTek, Sharp, and O&#x27;Film. The lenses were &quot;pre-assembled.&quot; Now, Apple is consolidating the production of its camera modules to its largest supplier, Foxconn, to save costs.

Up to last year, Apple has procured double and triple camera modules from its suppliers LG InnoTek, Sharp, and O&#x27;Film that are pre-assembled.



But it is now procuring these camera modules individually and gave the job of assembly to Foxconn. The measure is being done to save cost.
Foxconn, in preparation for its new camera assembly responsibility, has received new inspection equipment from the South Korean firm Hyvision System. The new system will check whether the wide, Ultra Wide, and Telephoto cameras&#x27; lenses, including their optical axis and image sensors, are correctly aligned on higher-end ‌iPhone‌ models. An incorrect alignment could result in drastically reduced image quality.



The new changes are being done to &quot;save costs,&quot; but it remains unclear if those savings would be presented to customers. It&#x27;s also unclear whether the new production methodology and Foxconn&#x27;s role in camera assembly will be in practice for the upcoming iPhone 13. Given that the new iPhones are already in production, that&#x27;s unlikely to be the case.

                    <span>The New York Times:
San Francisco leaders on Thursday unveiled some of the nation’s
toughest restrictions on unvaccinated people, barring them from
indoor dining, bars, nightclubs, gyms, large concerts, theaters
and other events held inside. The new rules, which take effect on
Aug. 20, would apply even to people who can show they have tested
negative for the coronavirus.
“This is an important step towards our recovery,” Mayor London
Breed said during a briefing announcing the new requirements. “We
all have to do our part. We need to get vaccinated.”
More like this, please.
Philadelphia re-instituted an indoor mask mandate starting today; I hope we follow New York and San Fran with a full-on “vaccinated or stay the fuck home” mandate.

                    <span>Adam Liptak, reporting for The New York Times:
Eight students had sued the university, saying the requirement
violated their constitutional rights to “bodily integrity,
autonomy and medical choice.” But they conceded that exemptions to
the requirement — for religious, ethical and medical reasons — “virtually guaranteed” that anyone who sought an exemption would
be granted one.
Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who oversees the federal appeals court
in question, turned down the student’s request for emergency
relief without comment. She acted on her own, without referring
the application to the full court, which was an indication that
the application was not on solid legal footing.

                    <span>Charles Gaba:
One thing I’ve been noting is that the R-squared (coefficient of
determination) for the graphs at both the state &amp; county levels
seems to have been inching up higher over the past month or two
… that is, the outlier counties seem to be gradually moving
closer to the graph’s trend line.
Furthermore, the slope of the trend line seemed to be moving
upwards as well over time. Both of these mean that not only is
there a clear correlation between a county’s 2020 partisan lean
and how quickly their residents are getting vaccinated, that
correlation is only increasing over time.
I decided to check to see whether this was an anomaly (just a
temporary thing) or not by going back to the county-level
vaccination data all the way back to February 1st, 2021. At that
point supplies of both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were
ramping up, but getting vaccinated was still limited mostly to
senior citizens 65 and older in the United States.
The whole series of charts is telling, but the last one — the animated one that shows how the partisan divide is increasing over time — is startling. The vaccinated aren’t going to forget this.

                    <span>The Hill, reporting on a new Fox News poll:
32 percent of Trump voters say they have no plans to receive one
of the three coronavirus vaccines available in the U.S., compared
to only 3 percent of Biden voters, the poll found.
86 percent of Biden voters say they’ve already been vaccinated,
while 54 percent of Trump voters said the same.
The Republican Party is a death cult. There’s no other way to put it.
And the one person who could most affect this — a man who himself was vaccinated as soon as possible — refuses to say a word.

About the visual part… Not sure what is doing Catalonia&#x60;s Almogabars in the image, as far as I know, they have nothing in common with India, but generally, this image looks good.

Like a flaming bag of dog poop passing in the night.
 A while back, I joked on Flyperbole that Flyers fans should erect a wall memorializing all of the awful defenseman the team has employed during the Claude Giroux era. Today, we take a look at an easy inductee for that unfortunate club in Erik Gustafsson, who was so terrible that the Flyers chose to healthy scratch him on occasion for the likes of Nate Prosser.



What exactly happened with Gustafsson this year that warranted frequent utterances of expletives from the mouths of fans? Let’s dive in.

Run a radio station, play D&amp;D, and try out a dating app
 Life is Strange: Wavelengths is a prequel to the upcoming Life is Strange: True Colors, and it has a super cozy vibe. Wavelengths is a DLC addition to True Colors, and it doesn’t seem to touch at all on the main mystery of Gabe Chen. Instead, we’re in the shoes of Steph, a young DJ who’s looking to make a mark in the world. Steph’s story plays out over four seasons, and we get to find out more about her and her life before we head into the main plot.
True Colors stars Alex Chen, a young woman who moves to a new city and ends up investigating the death of her brother. Alex is accompanied on her investigation by a supporting cast, which includes Steph, who also showed up in Before the Storm. Wavelengths gives us a little more background on who Steph is, and that may influence the choices players make throughout the story of True Colors.
The soundtrack includes songs from Girl in Red, Alt-J, Portugal, The Man, Foals, Hayley Kiyoko, and Maribou State. As Steph becomes more comfortable as a DJ, the player gets to see other aspects of her life. This includes running a D&amp;D game with a friend, using the D20 to give callers advice on the radio, and swiping left or right on profiles during Pride month. 
The entire DLC looks incredibly cozy, and it’ll be interesting to see how it adds to the main story. True Colors is set to be released on Sept. 10; Wavelengths will release soon after on Sept. 30.</span>

No, my spectral charge is ALSO named Bort
 League of Legends is in an interesting spot right now when it comes to lore, as its big world-spanning event has come to a close. Now that the Sentinels of Light have put down the Ruined King and saved the world, things should be pretty peaceful, right? Well, the event left a lot of loose threads hanging, like the fate of characters like Karma, Shyvana, or Thresh. On Thursday, Riot released a new cinematic that answers at least a few of those questions.
The cinematic stars Thresh, who is a spectral warden from the Shadow Isles. In the Sentinels of Light event, he gathered up all of the power from Viego’s scary invasion and used it to craft himself a different form. With this new, mostly human form, Thresh is free to wander the world. This cinematic is an immediate follow-up that shows us what he’s doing with his freedom, and it’s nothing good! He’s back to shackling and torturing souls inside his scary lantern, but at least he’s appointing middle management to help out. In this case, that’s an unfortunate tavern keep called Bort with a crab claw for an arm.
This cinematic also shows Thresh in a different light than his in-game splash art. Instead of having his sick abs out for everyone to admire, he appears much more sinister and skeletal in this one. Even when he’s just in the tavern, pretending to be a normal guy, you can tell there’s something off there. It’s a great rendition of the character, and it’ll be intriguing to see where his story leads.</span>

Another chance to meet Clyde, Tommy, and CJ
 Rockstar Games may be releasing remasters of three classic Grand Theft Auto Games, according to a report from Kotaku. This remains unconfirmed, but the remastered version of Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City, and San Andreas are rumored to arrive on Google Stadia, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and mobile devices.
Kotaku’s report suggests that the games will be “a mix of new and old graphics,” akin to a “heavily-modded version of a classic GTA title.” The UI of the games will be updated for clarity as well, though it’ll remain the classic visual style. Gameplay is expected to remain as close as possible to the original iterations.
These three titles are part of the “3D universe” of Rockstar Games, which include the PS2 era of Grand Theft Auto before the series moved into high definition with Grand Theft Auto 4. While these games aren’t quite as fleshed out or involved as Rockstar’s modern titles, they still remain classics. Lines from San Andreas, like CJ’s iconic “Ah, shit, here we go again,” remain a popular part of the zeitgeist.
Kotaku says Rockstar Dundee, a Scottish studio, is heading up development on these remastered titles. It’s unclear when they might be released, especially due to concerns from the COVID-19 pandemic, but it seems as though it will likely be in one bundle.
Rockstar also reportedly has plans for a Red Dead Redemption remaster.
We’ve reached out to Rockstar for comment, and will update this story should it respond with additional information.</span>

 Oil is coming to the apocalyptic world of Frostpunk in 11 bit studios’ reveal trailer for Frostpunk 2. The sequel takes place 30 years after the story in the original game, and will see players lead another society through the newly imposed ice age. Societies that were once built on coal will now be built on oil, and leaders will need quiet any rebellions that question their rule.
The original Frostpunk launched to critical acclaim in 2018 on PC; 11 bit studios eventually ported the game to consoles and added numerous expansion packs.

Michael K. Williams returns as ‘Irish’ from Battlefield 4
 Battlefield 2042 won’t feature a traditional narrative single-player campaign, but that doesn’t mean it won’t carry over storytelling elements from previous games — or that it won’t tell stories of its own. In a newly released short film titled “Exodus,” developer DICE and publisher Electronic Arts set up the story of Battlefield 2042 and confirm the return of a beloved character: Battlefield 4’s Kimble “Irish” Graves, once again played by Michael K. Williams.
The nine-minute film appears to confirm a canonical ending for 2013’s Battlefield 4: that Irish, not Huang “Hannah” Shuyi, survives the events of that game’s campaign. As such, Irish will be a playable “No-Pat” Specialist in Battlefield 2042. 
“Exodus” also introduces a new character to Battlefield lore named Oz. He clashes with Irish over the future of the No-Pats — 2042’s nickname for the non-patriated soldiers who fight in the upcoming game’s global conflict. EA said in a news released that the story of Battlefield 2042 will “continue to evolve over time” and will be told through future playable specialists — not unlike how EA’s Apex Legends or Blizzard Entertainment’s Overwatch handle their storytelling.
Irish is the fifth confirmed specialist coming in Battlefield 2042, following Casper, Mackay, Boris, and Falck, who were revealed in June. Battlefield 2042 is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X on Oct. 22.</span>

Vanguard will take players back to World War II
 Call of Duty fans appear to be heading back to World War II later this year with the next entry in the franchise, which is called Call of Duty: Vanguard, according to leaked images posted online.
Charlie Intel reports that the new season 5 update for Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War contained some hidden files showcasing pre-order details for 2021’s Call of Duty title. Data miners pulled the images and started sharing them online. Activision has met some of these posts with copyright takedown notices, forcing them to be removed.
The images themselves seem legitimate, suggesting that Call of Duty: Vanguard will be the game’s official title and that it will be set during WWII.

                    <span>In a paper published in 2017, Todd Kashdan and his colleagues identified five distinct dimensions of curiosity. Here are the first three:
1. Joyous Exploration. This is the prototype of curiosity — the recognition and desire to seek out new knowledge and information, and the subsequent joy of learning and growing.
2. Deprivation Sensitivity. This dimension has a distinct emotional tone, with anxiety and tension being more prominent than joy — pondering abstract or complex ideas, trying to solve problems, and seeking to reduce gaps in knowledge.
3. Stress Tolerance. This dimension is about the willingness to embrace the doubt, confusion, anxiety, and other forms of distress that arise from exploring new, unexpected, complex, mysterious, or obscure events.


They also identified four types of curious people: The Fascinated, Problem Solvers, Empathizers, and Avoiders. (via the art of noticing)

                    <span>The YouTube channel In Depth Cine has been looking at how directors like Spike Lee, Alfonso Cuarón, Martin Scorsese, and Wes Anderson shoot films at three different budget levels, from the on-a-shoestring films early in their careers to later blockbusters, to see the similarities and differences in their approaches. For instance, Wes Anderson made Bottle Rocket for $5 million, Rushmore for $10 million, and Grand Budapest Hotel for $25 million:

Steven Spielberg shot Duel for $450,000, Raiders of the Lost Ark for $20 million, and Saving Private Ryan for $70 million:

Christopher Nolan did Following for $6,000, Memento for $9 million, and Inception for $160 million:

You can find the full playlist of 3 Budget Levels videos here. (This list really needs some female directors — Ava DuVernay, Sofia Coppola, and Kathryn Bigelow would be easy to do, for starters. And Chloé Zhao, after The Eternals gets released.)

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/11/ios-15-wifi-5g-developer-tool/">

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Apple today released a new developer tool that is designed to force devices running iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 to priortize a 5G connection over a WiFi connection when on an insecure WiFi network or when a WiFi connection is slow.




5G devices running iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 can automatically prioritize connecting via 5G instead of WiFi when the performance of WiFi networks you visit occasionally is slow, or when you are connected to captive or insecure WiFi networks. Install the 5G Preferred Over Wi-Fi profile (&quot;profile&quot;) on devices running iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 Beta 4 or greater to greatly increase the likelihood of seeing 5G preferred over Wi-Fi connections and to ensure your networking path logic is optimized for situations where 5G will be preferred. For more information, see https://developer.apple.com/5g/.
Apple says that developers who want to prioritize 5G usage on their devices can do so by running the fourth beta of ‌iOS 15‌/‌iPadOS 15‌ or later and downloading the 5G Preferred Over WiFi Profile.



In iOS and ‌iPadOS 15‌, Apple has already added a new feature that causes 5G devices to automatically prioritize 5G when it provides an improved connection over WiFi, so this developer tool should boost that capability even further.

                    <span>Apple today seeded the fifth beta of macOS Monterey, the newest version of the macOS operating system. The fifth beta comes two weeks after Apple released the fourth macOS Monterey beta, and it is available to both developers and public beta testers. 





Registered developers can download the beta through the Apple Developer Center and once the appropriate profile is installed, betas will be available through the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences. Public beta testers can install the proper profile from Apple&#x27;s public beta testing website. 



As with all new betas, Apple recommends not installing the new macOS update on a primary machine because it is early release software and could have bugs.

                    <span>Apple today seeded the fifth beta of the upcoming watchOS 8 update to developers for testing purposes, with the update coming two weeks after Apple released the fourth watchOS 8 beta.





To install ‌‌watchOS 8‌‌, developers will need to download the configuration profile from the Apple Developer Center. Once installed, ‌‌watchOS 8‌‌ can be downloaded through the dedicated Apple Watch app on the iPhone by going to General &gt; Software update.



To update to new software, an Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery life, it must be placed on the charger, and it needs to be in range of the ‌‌iPhone‌‌. It&#x27;s not recommended to install ‌‌watchOS 8‌‌ on a main Apple Watch as the software may be unstable at this early date.

                    <span>New bipartisan antitrust legislation that targets Apple&#x27;s App Store and Google&#x27;s Play Store was today introduced by U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal, Marsha Blackburn, and Amy Klobuchar.





The Open App Markets Act [PDF] is meant to create &quot;fair, clear, and enforceable rules&quot; that will protect competition and strengthen consumer protections. According to the three senators, Apple and Google have &quot;gatekeeper control&quot; of the two main mobile operating systems and their app stores, allowing them to dictate the terms of the app market.



Under the terms of the bill, which applies to companies that own or control an ‌App Store‌ with more than 50,000,000 users, Apple would not be able to require developers to use its own in-app purchase system, and it would be required to allow devel…</span>

                    <span>Apple has begun selling a new third-party accessory for its MagSafe ecosystem, a folding stand from OtterBox priced at $39.95. The hinged stand includes a recessed area to house a user-provided ‌MagSafe‌ Charger and a slot for routing the cable through the stand and out the back.





The folding design is convenient for travel and lets you set your desired angle for nightstand viewing, video calls, and more in either portrait or landscape orientation. When folded completely back into a horizontal position, it can serve as a traditional Qi charger for non-MagSafe devices such as AirPods or other smartphones.



At $39.95 for the stand and an additional $39.00 for Apple&#x27;s ‌MagSafe‌ Charger, it&#x27;s not an inexpensive charging solution, but the removable charger setup does offer flexibility to only use the stand when needed.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(8 min)</span>
                    <span>Popular to-do app Things reached version 3.14 today and gained several additional note-related features: Bullet Lists, Markdown support, Find in Text, and Things Cloud &quot;Fractus.&quot;





Things has supported bullet lists before now, but you can now nest lists by inserting spaces in front of a bullet, and character lines now line up with the text of the previous line, thanks to the use of a fixed-width font.



When editing bullet lists, Things will now make the process a little easier by automatically stripping out &quot;double bullets&quot; during copy-paste.



Meanwhile, there&#x27;s a new Find in Text option that augments the existing search by searching specific notes. The option can be activated using the key shortcut Shift-Command-F, and is aimed at making it easier to narrow down a search in particularly long notes. 



In addition, Things now recognizes a wide range of commonly used Markdown syntax, making it easier to structure and style notes.





Lastly, Things Cloud &quot;Fractus&quot; is a new way of syncing text. Until now, each time the user modified a note – say to insert or remove a few words – the entire note would be synced again across all their devices. 



With Things Cloud &quot;Fractus&quot;, however, only the fragments of text that are modified get synced, which should improve the speed and efficiency of the sync, and allow for smarter resolution of conflicts. 



Things 3.14 can be downloaded from the Mac App Store for $49.99 and from the iOS App Store. The iPad version is priced at $19.99 [Direct Link] while the iPhone version (which includes Apple Watch support) is priced at $9.99. [Direct Link] A 15-day trial of Things for Mac is available on the Cultured Code website.

Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Flip 3


A key new feature of the Fold 3 is an uninterrupted 7.6-inch inner display with a 4-megapixel camera embedded under the screen, whereas the Fold 2 had a hole-punch camera. This is in addition to a trio of 12-megapixel rear lenses and a 10-megapixel front camera.

                    <span>One of the biggest hurdles for customers looking to switch between Android and iOS is their inability to transfer their WhatsApp chats between the two different ecosystems. Now, that&#x27;s coming to an end, as WhatsApp has officially announced that it will easily allow users to transfer their chats between Android and iOS.





As reported first by Engadget, WhatsApp used airtime during Samsung&#x27;s Galaxy Unpacked event to announce the new feature. WhatsApp tested the feature for the past few weeks and said it was difficult to implement due to &quot;end-to-end encryption,&quot; requiring added assistance to make it work. 



The feature will first arrive on Android devices, specifically Samsung smartphones, allowing users to initially transfer chats from iOS to Samsung smartphones. The transfer will include the chat itself, photos, videos, and voice memos, and should be available to Samsung users in the &quot;coming weeks.&quot; WhatsApp has not said when the feature will arrive for a wider range of WhatsApp devices and on iOS.

                    <span>BlueJeans Telehealth has today announced that it will integrate with Apple&#x27;s Health app to give more contextual information to healthcare providers.





BlueJeans Telehealth is a HIPAA-ready virtual care system that provides a way for healthcare providers to meet with their patients via a video call, integrating with the workflows of clinical teams to replicate the experience of onsite encounters.



The BlueJeans Telehealth app will now allow patients to share specific categories of health data from Apple&#x27;s Health app, including heart rate, ECGs, step count, mobility data, sleep, and falls, with their healthcare provider during telehealth appointments, via HealthKit. 



Patients can specifically control which encrypted health data they wish to share while supplying healthcare providers with additional information to give more informed advice.



Health data can be selected within the pre-visit patient landing experience or through the televisit tile during the session. Once synced, the healthcare provider will be able to see, expand, and interact with the Apple Health app data, allowing them to observe trends and highlight data on-screen for the patient.

                    <span>Apple today shared a new &quot;Today at Apple&quot; session on YouTube, exploring how to shoot and edit looping videos in the Clips app, with the help of director Romain Laurent and Jahmyra from Today at Apple. 






Viewers are encouraged to get involved simply with an iPhone and the Clips app, but may also wish to take advantage of a selfie stick or tripod.



The session covers how to make a simple loop video, match your movement, add an unexpected feature, finalizing looped videos, top takeaways, and export videos.



Apple says its free Today at Apple sessions are meant to inspire hands-on creativity in photography, art, design, video, coding, music, and more using Apple products and accessories like the ‌iPhone‌, iPad, Mac, and Apple Pencil. Initially hosted exclusively at Apple Stores, the sessions started to be offered online during the global health crisis, and Apple also started uploading sessions to YouTube last month.



This is the third Today at Apple session uploaded to YouTube, with the first exploring how to draw yourself as a &quot;Peanuts&quot; character in the Pages app using an ‌iPad‌ and ‌Apple Pencil‌ and the second explaining how to shoot and edit &quot;otherworldly&quot; photos with Night Mode.

                    <span>Apple announced earlier this year that, with iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, the Find My Network will be able to locate AirPods Pro and AirPods Max. Now, it has emerged that this will be achieved by tethering the AirPods to a specific Apple ID, with an unusual system of covering the ‌AirPods Pro‌&#x27;s speaker holes to remove the linked account.





First spotted by 9to5Mac, iOS 15 developer beta five code has confirmed that, to work with Apple&#x27;s ‌Find My‌ Network, ‌AirPods Pro‌ and ‌AirPods Max‌ will need to be tethered to an ‌Apple ID‌. This means that even if a user connects someone else&#x27;s ‌AirPods‌ to their device, they will remain tethered to the owner&#x27;s ‌Apple ID‌.



To remove the configured ‌Apple ID‌ and disable connection to the ‌Find My‌ Network, such as when passing the ‌AirPods‌ to a new user, owners will have to follow a number of manual steps similar to the process for untethering an AirTag.



For ‌AirPods Max‌, users need to hold down the Active Noise Cancelation button at the same time as the Digital Crown for 12 seconds. For ‌AirPods Pro‌, users have to cover the interior and exterior grilles with their fingers while pressing the button on the stem three times in sequence.



Support for the ‌Find My‌ Network will likely come via an ‌AirPods Pro‌ and ‌AirPods Max‌ firmware update alongside ‌iOS 15‌ and ‌iPadOS 15‌ later in the fall. First and second-generation ‌AirPods‌ will not support the ‌Find My‌ Network.



Previously, all ‌AirPods‌ devices appeared in the ‌Find My‌ app, but were not remotely locatable using the ‌Find My‌ Network like an AirTag, which uses low-energy Bluetooth to feed a device&#x27;s location back to the owner via nearby iPhone or iPad.

                    <span>Mozilla has announced the public release of Firefox 91, featuring an enhanced version of its Total Cookie Protection for individual websites.





When you browse the web on your devices, websites will often leave cookies on your system so that they can remember you and what your preferences are.



Some cookies are genuinely useful, as they allow sites to save your personal information (such as your login credentials) so that you don&#x27;t have to keep entering it every time you visit. However, for the same reason, cookies can pose a privacy risk because of the information they hold about you. 





To combat this, Total Cookie Protection makes sure websites can&#x27;t track users across websites by patitioning data storage into one cookie jar per website.



With Enhanced Cookie Clearing, when a user empties a cookie jar for an individual website, the entire jar is emptied, including any tracking data set embedded from another website, such as Facebook.



Firefox no longer shows individual domains that store data. Instead, it lists a cookie jar for each website visited, making it easier to identify and remove all data a website has stored locally, while also removing any leftover data from third parties embedded in that site.





For Enhanced Cookie Clearing to work, Strict Tracking Protection (Settings -&gt; Privacy &amp; Security) needs to be enabled. Enhanced Cookie Clearing will then be used when using &quot;Clear cookies and site data&quot; in the identity panel (the lock icon) or in the Firefox preferences.



In addition, there&#x27;s a new &quot;Forget About This Site&quot; option in the History menu that deletes a site from history along with any cookies and caches for it.



Firefox 91 is available now from the Mozilla website.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Apple this week dropped its long-standing lawsuit against Corellium, the security research company that provides security researchers with a replica of the iOS operating system, allowing them to locate possible security exploits within Apple&#x27;s mobile operating system, The Washington Post reports.





Apple filed a lawsuit against Corellium in 2019, claiming the security company was infringing upon its copyrights of iOS and iPhone. Last year, a judge dismissed Apple&#x27;s claim that Corellium had infringed upon the tech giant&#x27;s copyrights, claiming instead that Corellium was operating under fair rules. 



While Corellium offers a replica of the iOS operating system that runs on the ‌iPhone‌, the security research firm says that it benefits Apple if anything. By providing security researchers with access to the same operating system that runs on millions of devices, security experts can find security vulnerabilities and potential exploits more efficiently, leading them to be fixed by Apple.



Citing court documents, The Washington Post reports that Apple and Corellium have agreed on a confidential settlement to bring the lawsuit to an end. Despite Apple&#x27;s grievances with Corellium, however, the settlement does not include Corellium suspending the sale and distribution of tools used by security researchers.



Likely fueled by the lawsuit and the discussion around security research on ‌iPhone‌, Apple last year launched a program that would give security researchers access to specially configured iPhones for researching security vulnerabilities and exploits.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/10/apple-refurbished-8th-gen-ipad/">

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Apple this week began selling refurbished 8th-generation iPad models through its online store in the United States for the first time since the device was released last year. As usual, the refurbished models are discounted by approximately 15% compared to brand new models, with pricing starting at $279 for the 32GB model versus $329 new.





Apple says its certified refurbished iPad models are thoroughly inspected, tested, cleaned, and repackaged in a new white box, with a Lightning cable, power adapter, and manuals included in the box. A refurbished iPad also comes with a new battery and a new outer shell, making it virtually indistinguishable from a brand new iPad.



Introduced in September 2020, the 8th-generation iPad features a 10.2-inch Retina display and the A12 Bionic chip with a Neural Engine.



Refurbished iPads are covered by Apple&#x27;s standard one-year warranty. This coverage can be extended with an AppleCare+ for iPad plan, available for a one-time fee of $69 or $3.49 per month for 24 months in the United States.



Apple also started selling refurbished 2020 iPad Pro models this week. While certified refurbished iPads represent a decent opportunity for savings straight from Apple, better deals are sometimes available from resellers like Amazon and Best Buy. Be sure to monitor our Apple Deals roundup for the latest discounts on Apple products.

Panzarino: One of the bigger queries about this system is

 Kelly Hinkle joins Steve to discuss Carter Hart’s new contract with the Philadelphia Flyers, a Bach Update, Woodstock 99, and Guy Fieri’s newest creation - the apple pie hot dog. It’s a Flyperbole trifecta.

The former third-round pick finished up his final season in Philadelphia trending up, but not enough to prevent him from being dealt away as part of a defensive overhaul. 
 After the Flyers failed to quality for the 2020-21 Stanley Cup playoffs, GM Chuck Fletcher set out to overhaul a underperforming defensive group — one that had included Shayne Gostisbehere for the better part six-plus seasons. 
The 28-year-old, who narrowly lost out on the Calder Trophy back in a breakout 2015-16 season, was no longer in Fletcher’s plans moving forward on defense and was dealt to the Arizona Coyotes for the low price of second and seventh-round pick in the 2022 NHL Entry Draft.

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *Have we mentioned that August is boring? Well, August is boring. No one reads the links anyway. Anyhoo, player reviews continue in earnest with the ones that got away. Next up, Phil Myers. [BSH]
*Seems clear that Carter Hart is a more loose, happier, back-to-himself person now than he was last season. Which has to bode well for us. [NBC Sports Philly]
*The Flyers are now spending pretty big on their back end, and Chuck clearly thinks that the increase in salary will translate into an increase in favorable results. [Inquirer]
*Making a full-season NHL schedule is a nightmare and the Olympics only make it worse. [ESPN]
*And finally, if the offseason is good for anything is a series of fun Down Goes Brown thought exercises. This time? Which team can make the best six-team roster of players drafted in different rounds. Why not eh? [The Athletic]</span>

The never-ending quest to balance rifles continues
 Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War’s new season may have been delayed by a day, but that hasn’t stopped Treyarch from revealing the patch notes. The developer released the change list for the new season on Wednesday, giving players a preview of new updates to assault rifle balance, pistol nerfs, and the season’s new content. 
The biggest change in this patch is the assault rifle balance update, which touches several different weapons in the category. The weapon with the most changes is the XM4 rifle, which has several attachments adjusted to help give each attachment a more unique role. 
This patch also changes the FFAR 1. It will now have more damage up close, but slightly less at longer distances. The p…</span>

Welcome to Bandle City
 The world of Legends of Runeterra is about to get a whole lot cuter. On Wednesday, Riot Games released an animated trailer revealing the next set of champions and locations from League of Legends to come to the franchise’s card game. Beyond the Bandlewood introduces Bandle City as a region, along with 126 new cards. This includes 9 new champions, including some from outside Bandle City like the Piltover sheriff Caitlyn.
The new expansion will also have new keywords that reflect the whimsical nature of the Yordles. In League of Legends, these little furry creatures are similar to the fae, and they often have magical powers. While factions like Noxus or Demacia focus on martial might and very grounded characters, Bandle City’s a little more wild. Characters like Teemo and Veigar have been around since the early days of League, and it’ll be interesting to see how their abilities are interpreted for a card game.
It also looks like we’re getting a new Senna card that matches her current in-universe look, and likely some new Sentinels of Light-related cards to match her. However, the bulk of the Bandlewood expansion should focus on yordles and their mischief. Beyond the Bandlewood is set to release on Aug. 25.</span>

 Pop star Ariana Grande has come to Fortnite, and with her arrival comes a much-needed dose of glam. 
Grande descended onto the humble Tomato Town for a virtual concert, and with her, she brought a set of aesthetic items for players to purchase. Fans had the opportunity to buy two Ariana Grande skins — each of which rocked her iconic high-pony — and other battle items like a sparking glider and a diamond-like hammer.

 Stock car racing is coming back to consoles and PC this fall and, appropriately enough, there’s a new engine under the hood.
NASCAR 21: Ignition, made in Unreal 4, will launch Oct. 28 for PlayStation 4, Windows PC, and Xbox One. It’s the second NASCAR title published by new label Motorsport Games, a subsidiary of the global media company Motorsport Network, best known for its Motorsport.com website.

The next big sensation might be here
 Hell Let Loose looks generic at first glance — it’s a World War II shooter with tanks, guns, and explosions. If you’re not paying attention and you click on a random stream of the game, it looks like a scene you’ve seen a hundred times before. But developer Black Matter expertly threads the genre needle between goofy, Looney Tunes multiplayer chaos and hardcore military sim precision, resulting in one of the best online shooters around right now.
Hell Let Loose is very clever with its simple premise. It&#x27;s a 50 vs. 50 battle, and the map is divided into sections. Players win by taking over the sections and out-maneuvering the enemy. There are traditional classes, like Scout, Medic, Engineer, Officer, or Tank Commande…</span>

Black Ops Cold War and Warzone’s new season won’t start until Friday
 Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and Warzone’s new seasons are almost here, but they’re not as close as they used to be. Treyarch announced on Wednesday that it is delaying the season 5 patch by 24 hours, meaning that it won’t be released until Friday — or really late Thursday for some time zones. 
Treyarch revealed the new features for Call of Duty season 5 last week, when it announced that it would include a new game mode all about double-crossing your friends. The season will also include five new multiplayer maps and weapons like the TEC-9, EM2 assault rifle, and the Marshall handgun. As usual, some of this content will be released when the season actually goes live,…</span>

This is incredibly serious business
 The latest Dead by Daylight patch looks pretty normal at first glance — there’s a buff to K-Pop killer the Trickster, and a host of bug fixes. But if you look a little closer, you’ll see a suspicious note that reads, “Fixed an issue that caused The Executioner’s rear to be too flat.”
The Executioner is Pyramid Head, the iconic Silent Hill villain. When he joined the fray back in June of 2020, fans celebrated his enormous ass. Dead by Daylight is all about being chased by a host of nefarious Killers, and some people like it when those Killers have a big butt. When developer Behaviour tweaked the Killer’s blood-stained smock, fans raised a fuss about how it looked. Had the developers dared to touch that perfect behind…</span>

Taking the train toward adventure
 Eastward, a charming adventure title from Shanghai developer Pixpil, will come to Nintendo Switch this September. The release was announced at Wednesday’s Nintendo Indie World showcase. Eastward was originally announced in 2018 and is planned for Nintendo Switch, PC, and Mac.
The game takes place in a fantasy world where society is on the brink of collapse and the population is declining. The player assumes the role of protagonists John and Sam, and uses their unique abilities to explore cozy towns, mysterious lairs, and toxic wastes. The world is plagued by a toxic miasma, and humanity has fled underground. John and Sam — a miner and a mysterious young girl with a frying pan and kinetic powers, respectively — decide to see what has happened to the world outside of the underground sanctuaries and set out on a road trip across the rails. 
Eastward is published by Chucklefish, who also published Stardew Valley and Risk of Rain, as well as developed Starbound and Wargroove. Eastward seems to fit perfectly within that portfolio, and fans will be able to crack into the strange world this September.</span>

A slightly more tactical twist on the run-and-gun franchise
 Metal Slug Tactics is coming to Nintendo Switch. Nintendo announced that the latest game in the Metal Slug franchise is on its way to the platform during its August Nintendo Indie World event. 
Metal Slug is known for its run-and-gun shooting, but the latest entry switches things up a bit with turn-based tactical gameplay. Metal Slug Tactics is all about approaching fights strategically and placing your troops in the correct positions for special bonuses. The game also adds roguelike elements to help keep each run fresh. 
But not everything about Metal Slug Tactics is new. The game still keeps the pixel-art graphics fans are used to from the Metal Slug franchise, along with some of its characters like Marco, Tarma, Fio, and Eri. Of course, since it’s a Metal Slug game, there are still plenty of guns and explosions too.
Metal Slug Tactics is set to come to Nintendo Switch and PC sometime in 2022.</span>

Tom Happ’s sequel to his 2015 Metroidvania available in eShop
 And just like that, Axiom Verge 2 arrives today for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Windows PC.
Tom Happ’s long-anticipated sequel to his acclaimed 2015 Metroidvania will be available Wednesday in the Nintendo eShop, PlayStation Store, and Epic Games Store. Axiom Verge 2 was shown during Wednesday’s Indie World showcase with a new trailer (above). 
In the first Axiom Verge, the player character is a researcher named Trace, who awakens from a laboratory accident on an alien world. As Trace, the player explores a glitched-out landscape, repairing code to continue their progress through each level.
Axiom Verge 2 was announced during an Indie World presentation in 2019, and originally scheduled to launch in the fall of 2020. However, it was delayed twice, most recently in May, and given a launch window for the third quarter of this year.
Happ is still largely the project’s sole developer; it took him five years to deliver the first Axiom Verge. That was a PlayStation 4 game when it launched in 2015, and was later ported to Wii U in 2016 and then the Switch in 2017.
A documentary about the first game’s creation was published in 2017; Happ made it free to watch via IGN back in May.</span>

                    <span>In an excerpt from his new book This Is Your Mind on Plants, Michael Pollan writes about caffeine, a performance enhancing drug that humans seemingly cannot get enough of.
Cognitive psychologists sometimes talk in terms of two distinct types of consciousness: spotlight consciousness, which illuminates a single focal point of attention, making it very good for reasoning, and lantern consciousness, in which attention is less focused yet illuminates a broader field of attention. Young children tend to exhibit lantern consciousness; so do many people on psychedelics. This more diffuse form of attention lends itself to mind wandering, free association, and the making of novel connections — all of which can nourish creativity. By comparison, caffeine’s big contribution to human progress has been to intensify spotlight consciousness — the focused, linear, abstract and efficient cognitive processing more closely associated with mental work than play. This, more than anything else, is what made caffeine the perfect drug not only for the age of reason and the Enlightenment, but for the rise of capitalism, too.
The power of caffeine to keep us awake and alert, to stem the natural tide of exhaustion, freed us from the circadian rhythms of our biology and so, along with the advent of artificial light, opened the frontier of night to the possibilities of work.


I particularly enjoyed — and by enjoyed I mean “found uncomfortably true” — this line:
Daily, caffeine proposes itself as the optimal solution to the problem caffeine creates.


For more information on how caffeine enabled the Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution, check out Tom Standage’s A History of the World in 6 Glasses.

                    <span>For the FT, Tim Harford writes about things that could have been invented far sooner than they actually were.
Consider the bicycle. It was not produced in even the most primitive form until the early 1800s, and a practical version with chain drive was not widespread until the 1880s — just in time to compete with the motor car.
Anton Howes, author of Arts and Minds, points to the flying shuttle, invented in 1733. “It radically increased the productivity of weaving,” he writes. “It involved no new materials…and required no special skill or science.” The craft that it transformed has been around long enough to be mentioned in the Old Testament.
Steven Johnson, in his book Extra Life, suggests that evidence-based medicine is an idea behind its time. The idea of running experiments is centuries old, but the first properly randomised controlled trial in medicine took place in 1948. It could easily have been routine before da Vinci’s time, but instead clinical trials lagged far behind anaesthetic, antibiotics, antiseptic, pasteurisation and vaccines.

                    <span>In the first part of a multi-video series on how the human immune system works, Kurzgesagt describes how the system’s first lines of defense work when your body is invaded by microorganisms.
The human immune system is the most complex biological system we know, after the human brain, and yet, most of us never learn how it works. Or what it is. Your immune System consists of hundreds of tiny and two large organs, it has its own transport network spread throughout your body. Every day it makes hundreds of billions of fresh cells. 
It is not some sort of abstract entity. Your immune system is YOU. Your biology protecting you from the billions of microorganisms that want to consume you and from your own perverted cells that turn into cancer.


Kurzgesagt founder Philipp Dettmer is publishing a companion book to the series, Immune: A Journey Into the Mysterious System That Keeps You Alive; it’s out in late September.
I have read a lot about the human immune system over the past 18 months, but this video was still helpful in understanding how it all fits together. For more information, consult their extensive list of sources or watch their earlier video on what the SARS-CoV-2 virus does to a human body.

                    <span>Apple today released the fifth betas of iOS and iPadOS 15 to developers, introducing additional tweaks to the new operating system that&#x27;s launching this fall.





As we get further into the beta testing process, the changes that are introduced are getting smaller as Apple begins to finalize its design plans for the update. Today&#x27;s beta focuses on small changes and refinements to iOS and iPadOS 15 features.

The design of the Weather app icon has been tweaked slightly. It&#x27;s a darker blue than the prior version.

                    <span>Last week, Apple previewed new child safety features that it said will be coming to the iPhone, iPad, and Mac with software updates later this year. The company said the features will be available in the U.S. only at launch.





A refresher on Apple&#x27;s new child safety features from our previous coverage:
First, an optional Communication Safety feature in the Messages app on iPhone, iPad, and Mac can warn children and their parents when receiving or sending sexually explicit photos. When the feature is enabled, Apple said the Messages app will use on-device machine learning to analyze image attachments, and if a photo is determined to be sexually explicit, the photo will be automatically blurred and the child will be warned.



Second, Apple will be able to detect known Child Sex…</span>

                    <span>Apple today seeded the fifth beta of the upcoming tvOS 15 update to developers for testing purposes, with the new beta coming two weeks released the fourth beta.





Developers can download the new tvOS 15 beta by downloading a profile onto the ‌Apple TV‌ using Xcode.



Apple shared little about tvOS 15 when it was unveiled, but there are some new features that are coming to the operating system. SharePlay, a FaceTime feature that lets multiple users watch TV shows or movies together, will integrate with tvOS, and there&#x27;s a new &quot;For All of You&quot; recommendation engine that suggests shows everyone might enjoy.



A Shared With You section also displays movies and shows that were shared with you through the Messages app so you remember to check them out. When paired with AirPods Pro or AirPods Max, the ‌Apple TV‌ supports Spatial audio for a theater-like surround sound experience, and there&#x27;s a new feature for automatically connecting your AirPods through Smart ‌AirPods‌ routing.



Hey Siri commands can be used to launch Apple TV+ shows, and two HomePod mini speakers can be paired with the ‌Apple TV‌ 4K for stereo sound. If you have HomeKit cameras, you can also now view multiple cameras at the same time on the ‌Apple TV‌.

                    <span>Apple&#x27;s Head of Privacy, Erik Neuenschwander, has responded to some of users&#x27; concerns around the company&#x27;s plans for new child safety features that will scan messages and Photos libraries, in an interview with TechCrunch.





When asked why Apple is only choosing to implement child safety features that scan for Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM), Neuenschwander explained that Apple has &quot;now got the technology that can balance strong child safety and user privacy,&quot; giving the company &quot;a new ability to identify accounts which are starting collections of known CSAM.&quot;



Neuenschwander was asked if, in retrospect, announcing the Communication Safety features in Messages and the CSAM detection system in iCloud Photos together was the right decision, to which he responded:

                    <span>The 2022 iPhones and Macs may feature chips built on the 3nm process, as Apple&#x27;s leading chip supplier, TSMC, is planning to begin mass production for 3nm chips destined for Apple in the second half of next year, according to a preview of an upcoming report by DigiTimes. 





The paywalled preview of the full report, which will be published tomorrow, reads: 

TSMC is on track to move its 3nm process technology to volume production in the second half of 2022 for Apple&#x27;s devices, either iPhones or Mac computers, according to industry sources.
Earlier in June, TSMC was reportedly beefing up capacity to begin production of 3nm chips, but DigiTimes at the time refrained from mentioning Apple as a potential initial beneficiary of the new process. Today&#x27;s preview directly means that just two years after unveiling chips based on the 5nm process, Apple may plan to make a direct jump to 3nm as soon as next year.



Apple has already reportedly booked TSMC&#x27;s entire production capacity for 4nm chips for Apple silicon Macs. That report, however, has no timeline as to when Macs with 4nm chips may debut. 



The A14 Bionic chip, first introduced in an updated iPad Air and later put into the iPhone 12 series, is built on the 5nm process. Compared to earlier processes, the smaller architecture provides improved performance and increased energy efficiency. For this year&#x27;s iPhone, Apple will use an enhanced version of the 5nm process. 



The full report tomorrow is likely to offer more color surrounding Apple&#x27;s plan to roll out chips built on the 3nm process. We&#x27;ll be sure to let MacRumors&#x27; readers know if the new report shares anything of significance.

                    <span>Apple plans to launch a new MacBook Air with a mini-LED display and several color options around mid 2022, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said today in a research note obtained by MacRumors. These details line up with previous rumors about the new MacBook Air from sources like Bloomberg&#x27;s Mark Gurman and YouTube tech personality Jon Prosser.




A colorful MacBook Air concept shared by Jon Prosser


Kuo said the new MacBook Air will feature an &quot;all-new design&quot; with a similar form factor as the next MacBook Pro models, which are also expected to feature a mini-LED display and flatter top and bottom edges. Previous rumors have suggested the new MacBook Air will also feature a faster Apple silicon chip and a MagSafe-branded magnetic power cable. 



Kuo said it is not yet certain whether the existing M1 MacBook Air will be discontinued after the mini-LED model enters mass production, and this could have an effect on pricing. If the M1 MacBook Air is discontinued, Kuo said the mini-LED model will probably start at the same $999 price. If the M1 MacBook Air does remain available for purchase alongside the mini-LED model, Kuo believes it could receive a price cut.



Chinese manufacturer BOE will supply the mini-LED displays for the new MacBook Air, whereas LG, Sharp, and Foxconn subsidiary GIS will supply mini-LED displays for the upcoming MacBook Pro models, according to Kuo. 



Apple last updated the MacBook Air with the M1 chip in November 2020.

Appointments to donate blood can be made through the Red Cross website.

                    <span>Twelve South today announced a new addition to its PlugBug charger lineup with the launch of the PlugBug Slim, a new 20W USB-C charger that&#x27;s useful for travel with its thin design.





Priced at $24.99, Twelve South describes the PlugBug Slim as a space-saving charger that&#x27;s 0.67 inches thick (17mm), so it better blends into the wall and fits into tight spaces where furniture might be close to an outlet.



The prongs of the PlugBug Slim are designed to fold down so that it can be tucked into a pocket or slipped into a bag or purse when on the go, and there&#x27;s a small light at the bottom to let you know when your device is charging.





The PlugBug Slim is a GaN charger, and while there are many GaN charging options on the market now with compact designs, there are fewer that have focused on a slimmer profile for small spaces. At 20W, the PlugBug Slim works with the iPhone models and offers fast charging, charges up the iPad, and supports the HomePod mini.



Twelve South&#x27;s PlugBug Slim can be purchased from the Twelve South website for $24.99.

                    <span>Several retailers today have Apple&#x27;s AirPods Pro at $189.99, down from $249.00. You&#x27;ll find this sale price at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target.



Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.



This has been the most popular discount price on the AirPods Pro for 2021. We have seen the AirPods Pro dip below $189.99 in the past, but those were mainly for sales around the holidays and they&#x27;ve been extremely rare since then.

For the lower-cost model, only Amazon has the AirPods with Wired Charging Case for $113.99, down from $159.00. This new sale price beats the previous popular deal on the AirPods by about $6, and it&#x27;s the best deal online right now.

Lastly, the AirPods with Wireless Charging Case is marked down to $129.98 at Walmart, from $199.00, which is an all-time low on this model of the AirPods. It is being matched at Amazon, but due to stock shortages you won&#x27;t see a shipping date in August at that retailer.

                    <span>Two popular Japanese prepaid money cards will be gaining support for Apple Pay later this year, allowing the cards to be added to the Wallet app for contactless payments using an iPhone or Apple Watch where accepted, it was announced today. 





The cards set to gain Apple Pay support include Seven &amp; I&#x27;s Nanaco card and AEON&#x27;s WAON card, as noted by Ata Distance. The blog, which focuses on mobile payment and transit cards in Japan, believes it will likely become possible to add the cards to the Wallet app shortly after the public release of iOS 15, which is expected in September.





As part of its Apple Pay announcement, Seven &amp; I said it has issued around 74 million Nanaco cards that are accepted at around 800,000 retail locations in Japan, including 7-Eleven and Ito-Yokado stores. Likewise, AEON said it has issued over 87 million WAON cards that are accepted at more than 840,000 retail locations across the island country.  



Apple Pay continues to expand to more issuers around the world, including ING in Belgium and FNB in South Africa earlier this month.

                    <span>Amid the ongoing controversy around Apple&#x27;s plans to implement new child safety features that would involve scanning messages and users&#x27; photos libraries, Facebook&#x27;s former security chief, Alex Stamos, has weighed into the debate with criticisms of multiple parties involved and suggestions for the future.





In an extensive Twitter thread, Stamos said that there are &quot;no easy answers&quot; in the debate around child protection versus personal privacy.



Stamos expressed his frustration with the way in which Apple handled the announcement of the new features and criticized the company for not engaging in wider industry discussions around the safety and privacy aspects of end-to-end encryption in recent years.
Apple was invited but declined to participate in these discussions, and wit…</span>

                    <span>The upcoming 2021 iPhones will feature a spate of new camera features tailored for professional users, including ProRes for videos, Portrait Mode for video, and design updates by the means of a smaller notch, according to a new report from Bloomberg&#x27;s Mark Gurman. 





According to Gurman, Apple plans to include Portrait Mode video in this year&#x27;s iPhone lineup, which will allow users to record videos with an added bokeh effect behind the subject. Apple released Portrait Mode with the ‌iPhone‌ 7 Plus, but it&#x27;s since remained exclusive to photos. It&#x27;s worth noting that with iOS 15 this fall, FaceTime will be gaining Portrait Mode for all compatible devices. 

Apple first added Portrait mode to the iPhone 7 Plus in 2016, and it quickly become a fan favorite. The feature can put a per…</span>

                    <span>Apple display supplier Samsung is in the early stages of preparing its production line for OLED displays that are expected to be used in future models of the MacBook Pro, according to new information shared today by The Elec.





The report says that Samsung Display has begun early development of a new production process for OLED displays. This new production capacity will be used by Apple for future OLED MacBooks, according to the report. 



DigiTimes has reported that Apple is tentatively scheduled to release a 16 to 17-inch MacBook Pro with an OLED display in 2022. Apple is also reportedly planning a 10.9-inch iPad and 12.9-inch iPad Pro with OLED displays for the same year. 



Apple just this year released a new ‌iPad Pro‌ with a mini-LED display and is expected to be just weeks away from launching updated 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros with similar display technology. DigiTimes said that Apple would allow ‌iPad‌ and MacBook models with OLED and mini-LED displays, which are considerably different technologies, to coexist within their respective product lineups. 



Apple currently uses OLED displays in its flagship iPhones, Apple Watch models, and the Touch Bar in the current MacBook Pros. The company has yet to expand OLED technology to other products.

                    <span>Parallels Desktop 17 was released today, bringing native support for Windows 11 and macOS Monterey to both Intel and Apple silicon Macs, as well as a range of performance and compatibility improvements.





It&#x27;s worth noting from the off that the versions of Windows that Parallels 17 can run on an M1 Mac are currently limited to the Insider Previews for Windows 10 and Windows 11, due to their compatibility with ARM-based hardware. However, Parallels has promised that when Windows 11 is officially released to the public, the virtualization software will be able to run it.



With that caveat, for both ‌M1‌ and Intel systems, Parallels 17 resumes Windows and Linux up to 38% faster compared to the previous version, and benefits from a sixfold increase in OpenGL graphics processing …</span>

Most importantly, buying an Apple TV no longer gives users a
content advantage. We are in the age of streaming services like
Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Hulu, and business models have
shifted so that every service is available on every device — phones, tablets, TV sets, streaming sticks and game consoles.
Apple, known for its closed ecosystem, is even embracing the shift
by offering many services on smart TVs and boxes made by
competitors. […] That made the Apple TV a mostly pointless
accessory, and consumers seem to agree: 2020 data from Strategy
Analytics found that the Apple TV holds 2% of the streaming
device market.

                    <span>Mark Gurman, with a few scoops on the upcoming new iPhones:
Apple first added Portrait mode to the iPhone 7 Plus in 2016, and
it quickly become a fan favorite. The feature can put a person in
sharp focus while blurring the background in what is known as a
bokeh effect. For the new iPhones, Apple plans to add this same
technique to video with a feature internally dubbed Cinematic
Video. Like with still photos, the iPhone’s depth sensor will
create the effect and allow users to change the amount of blur
after recording. […]
Another feature will let users better control the look of colors
and highlights in their pictures. Users will be able to choose
from several styles to apply to their photos, including one for
showing colors at either a warmer or cooler temperature while
keeping whites neu…</span>

Nuanced opinions are OK on this.

                    <span>Goodbye, leaf-eater; we hardly knew ya.
 The Flyers had a letdown season in 2020-21, but perhaps no single player had a more brutal year in terms of on-ice performance than Phil Myers. Coming off of a promising 2019-20 campaign where he flashed talent befitting a second pair defender, the 24-year-old right hander hugely underwhelmed and at points didn’t even look like an NHL player. Now traded to the Nashville Predators in a package including Nolan Patrick for Ryan Ellis, Myers is no longer a player that Flyers fans really need to invest their attention in. That said, it’s important to investigate what led to his eventual departure from Broad Street. Let’s dig in.

*The Flyers’ signing kicked off a few more goalie signings, with the Caps resigning their guy for only a year. No gambles taken there. [Japers’ Rink]
*And then the Rangers locked up their guy for way more money and one more year than the Flyers gave Carter Hart. [Blueshirt Banter]

A modder added the popular traversal tool to another open-world game
 No, that’s not Link floating across the land of Skyrim. It’s the Dragonborn. 
Thanks to a new mod that adds Link’s paraglider from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild to Skyrim, you can now float across the land just like the hero of time would. The mod was published on Nexus Mods by two users, Loki and NickNak on Aug. 4, but was trending on Nexus Mods Tuesday. 
The “about” section on the game’s page says that the creators have been developing it for six months. Now, it has finally reached a “playable, working state” and is ready for everyone to use. A video shows it in action, but the glider has a nice float to it — you don’t sink too quickly — and it looks helpful when jumping off from forts. 
In the expansive world of Breath of the Wild, Link’s paraglider is an invaluable tool. Using it allows you to traverse the landscape with ease by gliding from a high point like a mountain peak. Gliding in Breath of the Wild has even inspired later game developers to add it to their game.
Similar to Breath of the Wild, Skyrim is a large open-world game with a vast wilderness to explore.  If you don’t have a horse on hand, it can be a pain to run through giant, open fields. Now, fans of Skyrim on Windows PC will be able to use a paraglider to fly and explore the landscape. 
The mod doesn&#x27;t add climbing — so you’ll only get half the Breath of the Wild experience, but hey, we’ll take it!</span>

Players who pre-ordered get in Aug. 13, general public can play Aug. 20
 Diablo 2: Resurrected’s multiplayer beta begins this weekend, Blizzard announced on Tuesday. Players who pre-ordered the remaster of the 2000 dungeon crawler will get in on an early access weekend starting Friday afternoon, with the public open beta following the next weekend.
The early access period starts Friday, Aug. 13 at 1 p.m. EDT/10 a.m. PDT, and is available to those with a pre-order for Diablo 2: Resurrected or the Diablo Prime Evil Collection (a special edition with some extra in-game stuff for $20 more).
The open beta starts Friday, Aug. 20 at 1 p.m. EDT/10 a.m. PDT. This beta and the early access beta include all platforms except Nintendo Switch. Players may try out cross-progression support on the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X versions.
Blizzard says both betas will allow players to try out five classes: Paladin, Druid, Barbarian, Amazon, and Sorceress. The multiplayer component will support up to eight players in PvP or PvE play.
Both beta periods will be limited to the game’s Act I: The Sightless Eye and Act II: The Secret of the Vizjerei. But there will be no level cap, so players can try out a variety of builds for as long as they want to progress in these two acts.
Blizzard’s official blog post has more details. Diablo 2: Resurrected launches Sept. 23.
Blizzard first announced Diablo 2: Resurrected at BlizzConline earlier this year. At the time, executive producer Rod Ferguson stressed that Resurrected is a remaster, not a remake. 
In a technical alpha held in April, we found Diablo 2 was just as faithful a re-release as Blizzard had promised, and that its controller support made all the difference for newer players.</span>

A promising cyberpunk shooter without the confidence to see things through
 There’s no denying it: The Ascent has style. It’s drenched in neon and thrumming with decay. What’s not coated in chrome is swallowed by rust, and though it draws on the usual cyberpunk influences — Neo-Tokyo, Midgar, dystopian Los Angeles, to name a few — I can’t help getting lost in its singular energy. 
Of course, style can go only so far. To quote William Gibson, “When you want to know how things really work, study them when they’re coming apart.” The Ascent frequently comes apart. It’s a collision of genres that, even at its best, can’t decide what it wants to be.

The new patch also lets players customize their crosshairs in even more detail
 Valorant’s first patch in nearly three weeks has arrived, and the biggest change is a bug fix that’s technically a huge nerf to Viper’s Ultimate. The patch also includes more customizable crosshairs, and the ability to shoot through more parts of maps than before. 
At the beginning of Valorant’s latest season, Riot released a patch that allowed Viper to place her Viper’s Pit Ultimate ability wherever her crosshair was pointing, rather than at her feet, like it was previously. This turned out to be a massive buff to the Agent, since she could place the ability in hard-to-reach places and throw it out while safe behind cover. The only problem was, Riot didn’t intend for this to happen. …</span>

Homage to PC gaming warhorse of the 1990s comes with 25 titles, can sideload more
 The latest throwback mini console is an homage to a home computer — the Commodore Amiga 500, reborn as The A500 Mini from Retro Games Ltd, the same company behind 2018’s C64 Mini. The collector’s item/conversation piece will cost $139.99 when it goes on sale in early 2022, the 35th anniversary of the PC’s launch.
Classic gaming fans will find 25 Amiga staples in the A500’s onboard library of games — among them Interplay’s 1991 hit Another World, the 1993 point-and-click adventure Simon the Sorcerer, steampunk run-and-gunner The Chaos Engine (which was later ported to home consoles of the day), and Team 17’s 1995 hit Worms (as Worms: The Director’s Cut), which launched a franc…</span>

                    <span>The 2020 Summer Olympics are over, but it’s never too late to find inspiration in the athletes who competed. For the New Yorker, Nathan Fitch made a short film about professional skateboarder Lizzie Armanto, who was then preparing to represent Finland in the first ever skateboarding competition at the Olympics.
“There [are] no masters,” Armanto says. “And even the people that we call masters — they haven’t done every trick. No one can do everything on a skateboard at all times without failing. Everyone falls, and everyone will have something that they can work on.”


Armanto didn’t medal at these Games — she broke several bones and underwent surgery after a skating accident in late 2020 and was perhaps still recovering from that. But she represented Finland and her sport in fine style; she helped design the uniforms she wore:
Those distinctive squiggles were actually an homage to Finland, the country Armanto was competing for. Specifically, she was inspired by architect and designer Alvar Aalto. “In 1939, he designed a kidney-shaped swimming pool which became synonymous with pool skateboarding much later in the ’70s,” Armanto says. “The various patterns on the jumpsuits are modeled after empty swimming pools around the world.”

                    <span>Check out Italian photographer Paolo Pettigiani’s photos of the evaporation ponds of Camargue, France. While these ponds are industrially harvested for their salt, the pink color of the water is naturally occurring in the salt marshes of the area, caused by halophile dunaliella salina algae. The area is also an important bird habitat and is one of the few places in Europe that flamingos live, which might seem like a coincidence until you learn that flamingos gain their pink color from eating the algae and shrimp that also feed on the algae.

                    <span>Apple today began offering refurbished versions of the second-generation 11-inch iPad Pro and fourth-generation 12.9-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ models that were originally released in March 2020.





Pricing starts at $609 for the 11-inch iPad Pro models, which Apple says is a savings of $90. Pricing on the 12.9-inch models starts at $749, a $200 discount.



The 2020 ‌iPad Pro‌ models preceeded the M1 ‌iPad Pro‌ models and introduced new camera technology with an included LiDAR Scanner for depth-sensing capabilities.

                    <span>Apple Arcade recently surpassed over 200 games available on the subscription-based gaming service, and Apple today previewed two additional titles coming soon. Apple did not provide a specific release date for either game.




Zookeeper World


&quot;Zookeeper World&quot; from Kiterestu is a new installment in the &quot;Zookeeper&quot; action puzzle game series that will be available exclusively on Apple Arcade. Players will face a variety of challenging match-3 puzzles and collect coins while placing animals, equipment, and plants to increase the zoo&#x27;s charm to attract more visitors. Players will be able to expand and customize their zoo, upgrade their animals to be unique, and more.



&quot;Zen Pinball Party&quot; from Zen Studios is a pinball game that will feature table designs inspired by DreamWorks Animation and Hasbro brands. Players will challenge their friends and family for the highest score on tables featuring Trolls, Kung-Fu Panda, How to Train Your Dragon, MY LITTLE PONY, Theatre of Magic, Attack from Mars, and more.






In addition, Apple Arcade roleplaying game &quot;Fantasian&quot; from Mistwalker will be receiving a &quot;Part 2&quot; update on Friday. Apple says the latter half of the saga will feature a more quest-driven style of gameplay that can take anywhere between 40 to 60 hours for players to experience. The game was written by Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi.




Fantasian


Priced at $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year, Apple Arcade provides access to a catalog of around 200 games without ads or in-app purchases across the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV, with additional titles added periodically.

Employees of Teleperformance in Colombia, a major call center company used by Apple, have raised concerns about lengthy new contracts that allow them to be monitored by AI-powered cameras installed in their homes, voice analytics, and storage of data about workers&#x27; family members, including children. One worker based in Bogota, who works on the Apple account, told NBC News: 
The contract allows constant monitoring of what we are doing, but also our family. I think it&#x27;s really bad. We don&#x27;t work in an office. I work in my bedroom. I don&#x27;t want to have a camera in my bedroom.

                    <span>Apple is sending surveys to select owners of the now-discontinued 2015 12-inch MacBook, asking them about their opinion on the laptop&#x27;s size, feature set, and more.





Apple announced the 12-inch MacBook in 2015 as a super-light and thin laptop aimed at customers needing an ultra-portable notebook. The 12-inch MacBook featured a fanless design, an Intel processor and was the first Mac to feature the butterfly keyboard. The laptop started at $1299.



The 12-inch form factor was considerably popular, as customers enjoyed its thin and light design. Apple updated the MacBook in 2016 and 2017 but discontinued it in 2019 following the launch of the redesigned MacBook Air with Retina Display.

                    <span>Apple and Netflix are among the bidders for an &quot;Oscar bait&quot; film starring Jennifer Lawrence as the late Hollywood talent agent Sue Mengers, according to Variety. Bidding for the film has reportedly surpassed $80 million and could climb higher.





Mengers was a prominent Hollywood &quot;superagent&quot; from the 1960s through the 1980s, representing some big names in acting like Barbra Streisand and Burt Reynolds. She was known for her outsized personality while trying to secure the best deal possible for her A-list clients. The film adaptation of her life is directed by Paolo Sorrentino, who won an Academy Award for Italian film &quot;The Great Beauty&quot; in 2014.  



Lawrence is best known for playing Katniss Everdeen in the &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; film series and Mystique in the &quot;X-Men&quot; film series, as well as starring in films like &quot;Winter&#x27;s Bone&quot; and &quot;American Hustle.&quot; Lawrence is also set to star alongside Leonardo DiCaprio in the upcoming Netflix film &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Up,&quot; which will tell the story of two low-level astronomers who must go on a media tour to warn mankind of an approaching comet that will destroy Earth.



Apple TV+ is in the midst of securing several star-studded original films, with the streaming service set to gain slavery thriller &quot;Emancipation&quot; starring Will Smith and the high-profile Western crime drama film &quot;Killers of the Flower Moon&quot; starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert DeNiro, Brendan Fraser, and several other big names.

                    <span>To me, version 14 feels like the biggest major release of BBEdit in many years. For programmers, there’s a major new feature: Language Server Protocol (LSP) support, that, basically, adds a slew of IDE-style functionality for code completion, refactoring, and linting. There are also new language modules for R, Go, Lisp, and Rust.
For everyone, there’s a new “notes” feature. From the release notes:
You know that thing where you have a whole bunch of untitled
documents open, because it’s so easy to make one and type some
notes, and then just leave it open? And you rely on BBEdit’s
amazing crash recovery and document restoration to not lose
your carefully kept notes? You can keep doing that if you want,
but we have a new feature to make the whole thing faster and
easier: Notes.
Notes are mostly like ordinary text documents, except that you
don’t have to remember to save them or even make up a name if you
don’t want to. BBEdit keeps notes all together in a “notebook”.
Notes exist on disk as text files; there’s no secret file format
involved. […]
There are many ways to make a note, so you can use whatever fits
your workflow and style.
Notes default to Markdown, but you can change that to whatever you want (of course).

                    <span>Michael Buckley:
macOS only allows sandboxed apps to access a limited number of files at a time, but there is no way for an app to query how many files it can open, or if it’s close to the limit. In fact, this limit is dependent on the amount of RAM installed in the computer and the number of files open by other apps. Because this limit only affects apps that can batch process thousands of files, and users that want to do so, many users—and developers—remain unaware of it, despite the fact that it has affected some of Apple’s own apps.
This is the primary reason Retrobatch isn&#x27;t sandboxed (and thus, not on the App Store). I&#x27;ve considered just dealing with the likely support emails (and suggesting folks give it full disk access, or only add folder), but I just can&#x27;t bring myself to do it. What a pain this bug has been for years.
Every year at WWDC, since about 2015, I would hunt down a particular engineer I knew who was aware of this issue, and the first question I would ask is if this bug was fixed.

Philadelphia got one restricted free agent locked up.
 Even after an already hectic offseason for Philadelphia Flyers GM Chuck Fletcher, he had two more things to do and with the team electing for salary arbitration with restricted free agent defenseman Travis Sanheim, it was really just one thing left to do. And on Monday, they did it.
Announced by the team, the Flyers have re-signed goaltender Carter Hart to a three-year contract with a cap hit of $3.979-million, a nod to his No. 79 jersey.
OFFICIAL: Philly got Hart. https://t.co/1N2uUSGj8Q

This new deal is Hart’s first contract with the team since signing his entry-level deal way back in 2016, almost immediately after the Flyers drafted him…</span>

Analyzing the 10th and final season in Philadelphia for the high production Czech winger.
 Following a disappointing 2020-21 season that saw the Flyers miss out on the Stanley Cup playoffs, we knew the team was headed for change — and part of that change involved roster staple Jake Voracek. 
Flyers GM Chuck Fletcher ended Voracek’s 727-game career in Orange and Black by sending the soon-to-be 32-year-old to the Columbus Blue Jackets in exchange for winger Cam Atkinson. It’s a homecoming of sorts for Voracek, who was drafted seventh overall by the BJ’s back in 2007 before being sent to Philadelphia — along with a pick that became Sean Couturier — for Jeff Carter in 2011. 



The trade put an end to a tremendous 10-year run for Voracek and…</span>

That’s gonna come in handy, since these ancient machines need bio-material to operate. It’s a quick way to get accustomed to the weird world that awaits me out there.
Death Trash is an early access role-playing game by developer Crafting Legends that feels like a 2021 take on the original Fallout.

Have some watery fun in the wasteland
 Fallout 76 allows players to collect in-game blueprints and paid cosmetics to customize their CAMPs. It’s a wonderfully domestic way to spend time in the wasteland of Appalachia, and custom builds are a major part of the game’s community. Bethesda has expanded players’ options by adding tools for a fully fledged water park to the game, and it’s a source of both creativity and controversy.
The new water park allows players to set up some pretty impressive vacation spots that stand out against the desolate backdrop of raiders, mothmen, and abandoned settlements full of skeletons. Fans are already having fun setting up their own water parks for the summer. The water park also has synergy with some …</span>

Campaign versus mode not part of Turtle Rock’s L4D spiritual successor
 Turtle Rock Studios’ Back 4 Blood is wrapping up its early access preview on Monday — an open beta will follow on Aug. 12 — which has given players a sneak peek at the studio’s Left 4 Dead successor. As part of that early access preview, Back 4 Blood players learned something new about the co-op zombie shooter: The game won’t feature a campaign versus mode, as previous Left 4 Dead games have. 
Campaign versus was one of the multiplayer bedrocks of Left 4 Dead, so its exclusion from Back 4 Blood is surprising and, for many prospective players, disappointing. In campaign versus mode, two teams of four players (one side as the survivors, one side a…</span>

Bungie has slid its way into a new controversy 
 Bungie revealed a host of new changes coming to Destiny 2 last Thursday, and naturally, fans are pissed. But Destiny players aren’t mad that their favorite gun is getting nerfed or about the bevy of changes coming to various subclasses. No, Destiny players are mad about sliding changes. 
Sliding is a way of life in Destiny 2. While useful in PvE for moving quickly and dodging bullets, it’s most commonly seen in The Crucible, Destiny’s PvP mode. Sliding helps players move fast while lowering their profile, making it harder for enemy Guardians to track their movements. When paired with a shotgun, sliding becomes a powerful tool to surprise someone with a blast from the ground.

 Internal Affairs DDCollection is more than just a digitized version of a stylish comic book. It’s chaotic and loud, and “a less practical way to read digital comics,” according to creator Peow Studio. And that’s what makes it fantastic.
Peow Studio, a Swedish comics publisher, created its own digital comics reader for its Internal Affairs series, which features an Onion intern at a shitty company. And there are mechs.

Upgrade planned for PC, but not for PS4 or Nintendo Switch versions
 Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice has been optimized for Xbox Series X and Series S. The upgrade is free for anyone who has the game, which includes subscribers to Xbox Game Pass. 
The upgrade is only for the new Xbox consoles. Hellblade studio Ninja Theory says an update for PC “is currently in development,” but there are no plans to offer it for any other platforms. Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice launched in 2017 on PlayStation 4 and Windows PC. Microsoft acquired Ninja Theory in June of 2018.
The optimized Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice gives players three visual fidelity settings — performance, resolution, and enriched, with the latter offering ray tracing on both Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. Enriched mode supports dynamic resolutions up to 4K on Series X, and full HS on Series S, at 30 frames per second for both consoles.
Performance mode on Series X offers dynamic resolutions to 1080p at 120 Hz frame rates; it’s full HD and 60 fps on Series S. Resolution mode on Series X prioritizes dynamic resolutions to 4K, at 60 fps; Series S gets dynamic resolution support to 1440p at 30 fps.
“Also being added: Texture resolution bump, Chapter select, increased particle quality, increased draw distance, higher levels of detail,” the game’s official website says.
Ninja Theory said QLOC, the company behind Hellblade’s port to Nintendo Switch in 2019, handled the optimized version upgrade, freeing the studio to continue working on Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2. In June, the studio indicated the sequel was still early in development, likely the reason why it wasn’t shown at the Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase for E3 2021 that month. Senua’s Saga was announced at The Game Awards in December 2019.</span>

Microsoft promises game updates, but not much else
 Microsoft is heading (virtually) to this year’s Gamescom, the annual video game expo normally held in Germany every summer, in the form of a livestream on Aug. 24. That’s one day before Gamescom 2021 officially begins on Aug. 25. This year’s expo will be entirely digital, just like last year.
The Gamescom 2021 Xbox stream can be viewed on YouTube, Twitch, Facebook Gaming, and Twitter on Aug. 24 at 1 p.m. EDT/10 a.m. PDT/7 p.m. CEST.
The Xbox team promises “in-depth updates from some of our previously announced Xbox Game Studios titles alongside some of our third-party partners,” during its Gamescom 2021 stream. Expect Microsoft to focus on games scheduled for release this holiday season, like Halo Infinite, and titles coming to Xbox Game Pass.
Microsoft’s Aaron Greenberg, general manager of Xbox Games Marketing, reemphasized on Twitter that the stream is “focused on game updates coming this year.” Greenberg said viewers shouldn’t expect new reveals or major surprises, but teased “a fun stream.” (You can probably expect those new reveals and major surprises to show up during Gamescom Opening Night Live, a stream hosted by Geoff Keighley coming on Aug. 25 at 2 p.m. EDT/11 a.m PDT.)</span>

                    <span>There’s something romantic about falling for heavy metal in a language you don’t understand. In a way, it’s the purest form of the music–the words themselves, stripped of the power of recognition, rely entirely on their instrumental, musical, and emotional value rather than any preconceived notions as to what the songs themselves may be about. ...</span>

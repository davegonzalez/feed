                    <span>The AirTag feature that allows anyone with a smartphone to scan a lost AirTag to locate the contact information of the owner can be abused for phishing scams, according to a new report shared by KrebsOnSecurity.





When an AirTag is set in Lost Mode, it generates a URL for https://found.apple.com and it lets the AirTag owner enter a contact phone number or email address. Anyone who scans that AirTag is then directed automatically to the URL with the owner&#x27;s contact information, with no login or personal information required to view the provided contact details.



According to KrebsOnSecurity, Lost Mode does not prevent users from injecting arbitrary computer code into the phone number field, so a person who scans an AirTag can be redirected to a phony iCloud login page or anot…</span>

                    <span>Apple today updated its investor relations page to announce that it will share its earnings results for the fourth fiscal quarter (third calendar quarter) of 2021 on Thursday, October 28.





The fourth quarter earnings call will provide some insight into the early sales of the new iPhone 13 models and the new iPad options, giving us our first hints into how 2021 sales compared with 2020 sales.



Apple again declined to provide guidance for the fourth quarter of 2021 during its third quarter earnings call due to the ongoing global health crisis, which is continuing to cause uncertainty for product launch timelines and sales.



Apple in the third quarter brought in $81.4 billion in revenue, marking a new June quarter record thanks to strong sales of the iPhone, ‌iPad‌, and Mac.



The quarterly earnings statement will be released at 1:30 PM Pacific/4:30 PM Eastern, with a conference call to discuss the report taking place at 2:00 PM Pacific/5:00 PM Eastern. MacRumors will provide coverage of both the earnings release and conference call on October 29.

                    <span>Apple today seeded the eighth developer beta of macOS Monterey, the newest version of the macOS operating system. The eighth beta comes one week after Apple released the seventh macOS Monterey beta.





Registered developers can download the beta through the Apple Developer Center and once the appropriate profile is installed, betas will be available through the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences. 



According to Apple&#x27;s release notes, attempts to install ‌macOS Monterey‌ into a virtual machine will no longer fail sporadically after updating to the latest beta. 



‌macOS Monterey‌ will bring Universal Control, a feature that lets a single mouse, trackpad, and keyboard be used across multiple Mac or iPad devices, plus there&#x27;s a new AirPlay to Mac feature. Safar…</span>

                    <span>Apple last week launched an updated version of the iPad mini, which has been entirely overhauled with an iPad Air-like design. The new mini is basically a smaller version of the iPad Air, and we thought we&#x27;d check it out and share first impressions after 48 hours with the little tablet.

With an 8.3-inch display, the ‌iPad mini‌ has a bigger screen size than ever before, but it&#x27;s actually a touch less tall than the prior-generation version thanks to much slimmer bezels and the removal of the Home button.





Since there&#x27;s no Home button, the ‌iPad mini‌ uses a Touch ID power button, which works well. It&#x27;s just like the ‌Touch ID‌ power button on the ‌iPad Air‌, and it&#x27;s identical to the ‌Touch ID‌ Home buttons we…</span>

                    <span>iPad mini 6 owners have been complaining about a &quot;jelly scrolling&quot; problem that affects some iPad mini models when using the device in portrait mode, and Apple now says that the behavior is normal for an LCD screen.





&quot;Jelly scrolling&quot; refers to screen tearing, which can cause text or images on one side of the screen to appear to be tilted downwards because of a mismatch in refresh rates. It can cause one side of the display to look as if it&#x27;s responding faster than the other side, a visual disturbance that&#x27;s hard to miss once you notice it.



Apple told Ars Technica that jelly scroll is normal behavior for an LCD. The screen is designed to refresh line by line, which can cause a tiny delay between when the lines at the top of the screen and the bottom of the screen are refre…</span>

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Apple today seeded the second beta of iOS 15.1 to developers, and the update includes a fix for an annoying bug that&#x27;s been affecting iPhone 13 owners who also have an Apple Watch.





With beta 2, the Unlock with Apple Watch feature that was broken has been fixed, and an authenticated Apple Watch can once again be used to unlock an ‌iPhone 13‌ model when wearing a mask. 



Prior to the update, attempting to enable the Unlock with Apple Watch feature under Settings &gt; Face ID &amp; Passcode would result in an error that said the iPhone was unable to communicate with the Apple Watch. That error message has now been addressed, and the feature can be successfully toggled on after updating to iOS 15.1 beta 2. 



Apple in a support document promised that a fix for the issue would be coming in a future update, and it appears that update may be iOS 15.1. It&#x27;s not clear if we&#x27;ll also see an iOS 15.0.1 update that has a fix, as it could still be several weeks before iOS 15.1 sees a public release.

                    <span>DisplayMate today awarded the iPhone 13 Pro Max with its &quot;Best Smartphone Display Award.&quot; The device earned the company&#x27;s highest-ever display performance grade of A+ and set or matched 12 of its smartphone display performance records.





iPhone 13 Pro models feature a new Super Retina XDR display with ProMotion, which is Apple&#x27;s branding for a variable refresh rate between 10Hz and 120Hz. This technology allows the display to refresh from a power-preserving 10 times per second to an ultra smooth 120 times per second depending on the type of content that is on the screen.



One of the records that the iPhone 13 Pro Max set was highest full-screen brightness for smartphones with OLED displays, according to DisplayMate&#x27;s in-depth analysis. Apple says the iPhone 13 Pro Max has a max brightness of 1,000 nits for typical content and 1,200 nits for HDR content. By comparison, the iPhone 12 Pro Max has a max brightness of 800 nits for typical content and 1,200 nits for HDR content.



Other records set or matched by the iPhone 13 Pro Max include highest absolute color accuracy, highest contrast ratio, lowest screen reflectance, and more.



Samsung is the exclusive supplier of the LTPO OLED panels used for the iPhone 13 Pro Max, according to Display Supply Chain Consultants, but LG is reportedly aiming to begin supplying Apple with LTPO OLED panels as early as next year.



DisplayMate extensively tested the iPhone 13 Pro Max&#x27;s display, so make sure to read the full analysis for more details.

                    <span>Following the launch of the iPhone 13 models, Apple&#x27;s vice president of camera hardware engineering Graham Townsend and vice president of camera software engineering Jon McCormack spoke with British GQ&#x27;s Robert Leedham about iPhone cameras.





Townsend revealed that Apple starts planning future iPhone camera systems about three years in advance of public availability, suggesting that the company began developing the camera systems on the iPhone 13 models as early as 2018.
&quot;The planning has to start about three years ahead, because that&#x27;s when we actually fix the specification of the silicon,&quot; says Townsend. &quot;So, for instance, the sensor gets defined at that point and the A15 Bionic processor is also frozen.

                    <span>In a new blog post titled &quot;Bring the best of Google to your iPhone,&quot; Google is on an endeavor to convince new iPhone 13 users to transform their ‌device’s home screen to look like Android.





The blog post, written by Google&#x27;s director for the iOS platform, features screenshots of an ‌iPhone 13‌ home screen filled with Google apps and widgets. The post implies that customers should possibly consider replacing some of Apple&#x27;s default iOS apps, such as Photos, Safari, Calendar, Reminders, and even Phone, with Google&#x27;s equivalent of those apps, including Google ‌Photos‌, Google Chrome, Google Calendar, Google Tasks, and Google Voice, respectively.



Google continued to encourage customers to utilize the wide variety of ‌widgets‌ its iOS apps offer. Google said that if the right Google ‌widgets‌ are placed on the home screen, users will &quot;never even have to leave&quot; their home screens to stay caught up.



According to the blog post, users can also use &quot;Smart Stacks&quot; to stack different Google ‌widgets‌ on top of each other, allowing iOS to determine which widget is most relevant to show at any one time. 



Finally, Google recommends that users replace Safari with Google Chrome as the default iOS browser, allowing all system-wide links and Spotlight web suggestions to open in Chrome. Google closed by saying it hopes ‌iPhone 13‌ users, who just started receiving their new iPhones last week, will consider bringing &quot;the best of Google&quot; to their device instead of just simply purchasing an Android smartphone or device.

                    <span>macOS Monterey is set to be released later this year with Safari 15, with key new features including redesigned tabs, grouped tabs, automatic switching of sites from HTTP to more secure HTTPS when available, faster performance, improved security, and more. Apple also released Safari 15 for macOS Big Sur and macOS Catalina last week.





Unfortunately, some customers have experienced a few issues with Safari 15, which we&#x27;ve highlighted in more detail below.



YouTube Bookmarking Issue


On both macOS Big Sur and the macOS Monterey beta, it appears that attempting to bookmark a YouTube page in Safari 15 results in the browser crashing.






The issue was demonstrated with a video shared by YouTube channel Krazy Wabbit. As a temporary workaround, the video notes that user…</span>

                    <span>Local note, quite possibly of interest to non-locals as well: I’ll be on stage this Thursday afternoon at 2 pm for the B. PHL Innovation Fest, in a chat with Youngmoo Kim, director of Drexel’s ExCITe Center. It’ll be him, interviewing me, about the stuff I do and have done. I’ve known Youngmoo for a few years — this will be good. In-person attendance has been scrapped because of COVID-19 (they haven’t updated the website to make this clear), but virtual attendance registration is open and is now free of charge.
Good lineup of keynote speakers too, including Don Lemon and Sixers president Daryl Morey. (If I see him backstage, I’ll try to get the scoop on Ben Simmons.)

                    <span>September is Childhood Cancer Awareness Month, and the good folks at Relay FM always conduct a fundraiser. This year they’ve already raised a whopping $572K as I type this. What a wonderful annual tradition this is. St. Jude is an amazing institution: they both provide world-class treatment for kids with cancer free of charge and perform research to make those treatments better and more effective. Tiltify, the platform they’re using for fundraising, makes it super simple to contribute, including support for Apple Pay.
Let’s push Relay’s campaign way over the top with a push from the DF audience. (And if you do chip in, check if your employer matches charitable contributions.)

                    <span>Last April, after posting this photo of my desk setup for my iPad Air review, I got a few questions about the stand I was using to prop up the iPad. The answer was Anker’s $15 Multi-Angle Stand. Last week I posted a similar photo, this time for my iPad Mini review, and I’m still using the same stand. Alas, that stand is no longer available.
The closest thing I could find is this $10 copy of that stand from Amazon Basics. It’s such a blatant rip-off of Anker’s stand that ordinarily I wouldn’t link to it, on principle, but, given that Anker’s original is seemingly no longer being produced, a rip-off design is the best we can do. I even bought one to try it out before linking to it. (If you buy one through this link, I’ll earn affiliate revenue that will get me one step closer to buying one of the upcoming Jony Ive/Marc Newson-designed electric Ferraris.)
Amazon’s multi-angle stand is extremely similar to Anker’s in size, weight, and angles of tilt. But it’s slightly lacking in fit and finish compared to Anker’s. Whereas Anker’s felt like a bargain at $15, this one feels like what you’d expect from a $10 knock-off. My biggest annoyance is that Amazon, for some reason, decided to screen print “Press/Presse” on the button that you quite obviously must press to adjust the tilt. (Why French?) This is as helpful as printing “Press” on the knock of a click pen. And of course they typeset these needless words in Arial. A wee nip of nail polish remover took care of that, though.
I still recommend it. It folds flat, and when your iPad is sitting in it, the stand effectively disappears.

                    <span>Katie Deighton, reporting for The Wall Street Journal:
Ferrari NV hired Apple Inc.’s former design chief Jony Ive as it
readies its debut into full electric vehicles.
Mr. Ive’s design company LoveFrom Inc., which he formed in 2019
alongside industrial designer Marc Newson, will work with Ferrari
and its largest shareholder, Netherlands-based Exor NV on a number
of projects, the companies said Monday. […]
Ferrari declined to reveal the specifics of the collaboration, but
said it sees potential in working with LoveFrom across the whole
range of its business. Alongside its legacy production of its
engine-powered cars, the company sells clothes, watches and other
apparel.
If they wind up shipping a car through this collaboration, it might not cost that much more than the scrapped first draft Apple Car under Ive, which I’ve heard — admittedly like fourth-hand — would have started at $150,000. (Which is one of many reasons the project was rebooted.)
Cabel Sasser (click through for photos):
(Actually, Marc Newson’s Ford 021C concept was my dream car right
around 2000. It’s the perfect encapsulation of the style of that
time, a Deee-Lite/CD-ROM/Dreamcast/iMac/Virgin Megastore car. I
still want one today!!! But the Fun Design Train now only stops at
Luxury Station ☹️)
Newson’s concept car was indeed delightful — real-world car-from-Pixar’s Cars vibe to it.

Hey worst case, they can’t be as bad as the Eagles were last night.
 


It’s been a short, yet at the same time long off-season, but tonight the Philadelphia Flyers will hit the ice and play a preseason hockey game. A lot has changed since the Orange &amp; Black finished their 2020-21 season with a win over the New Jersey Devils on May 10, and tonight we get our first look at the new-look Flyers. 



At bare minimum what we cannot say about this team heading into the season is: this is the same ol’ Flyers. Jakub Voracek had been here since 2011, he’s out. Shayne Gostisbehere since 2015, he’s out. Nolan Patrick was the second overall pick a little over four years ago, he’s out. But in are an exciting group of players that it feels like Philly…</span>

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *Holy moly the games have arrived! Preseason games, but still. Real hockey games on your television. VERY EXCITING. Ahead of the real game, here’s a look at what happened in the friendly scrimmage that closed out training camp. [Flyers]
*Sean Couturier is not at all nervous about living up to his new contract this season. Which makes sense, since he already has. [Inquirer]
*If you are anything like us at Broad Street Hockey, you’re very interested to see how these new defense pairings look in these preseason games. In camp, at least, it seemed like the Ellis-Provy pair is going to work out just fine. [NBC Sports Philly]
*Speaking of that pair, Ryan Ellis doesn’t just want to be a good partner on the ice. He wants to be a good buddy, too. [BSH]
*Sticking with our badass new defense, Keith Yandle doesn’t care about his Ironman streak. He’s just good at playing hockey. [Inquirer]
*Once again, the Metro Division is shaping up to be the toughest in hockey. Hooray! [The Hockey News]
*And finally, pals, it’s been a long Summer. A busy Summer. The Flyers might be good again. And tonight, we start to get a look at them. Enjoy the game, everyone! Let’s go Flyers!!</span>

 Netflix has acquired Oxenfree developer Night School Studio, the companies announced Tuesday. The game studio, known for its branching narratives, will create original games for the streaming platform’s nascent foray into video games.
Night School Studio founder Sean Krankel said in a blog post about the acquisition that the company will continue working on Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals, which it currently expects to launch in early 2022 on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC. As the first games studio to join Netflix on this new project, said Krankel, Night School wants to “stretch [its] narrative and design aspirations across distinctive, original games with heart.”
Krankel added, “Our explorations in n…</span>

God fucking dammit Kris where the fuck are we
 Undertale spawned a following that turned it into a cultural touchstone for an entire generation of gamers. So when its creator, Toby Fox, released a new chapter of his Undertale spinoff, Deltarune, there was no surprise that this new section of the game would inspire players to create art and write fanfiction. Fans are now filling Twitter, Reddit, and YouTube with Deltarune Chapter 2 memes starring two of the game’s main characters, Kris and Susie. 
Deltarune is a spinoff of Undertale. The entire game isn’t out yet — Fox split it into chapters, and released the first one in 2018. In September, he announced a surprise release of the second chapter via an anniversary stream for Undertale, and has since said that he will…</span>

The space puzzler’s Echoes of the Eye DLC encouraged me to revisit the modern classic
 I first played Outer Wilds in 2019, when the game was initially released. I marveled at the galaxy’s beautiful planets, playing as a Hearthian alien on my first space expedition. The trip would take me away from my home of Timber Hearth and across the cosmos, exploring archaeological ruins, and sussing out the civilization that left them behind. The game was, put simply, stunning.
But Outer Wilds was also incredibly difficult. Navigating the ship required controlling six thrusters, and charting a course that would let me land on orbiting celestial bodies. The game’s time loop proved to be the ultimate challenge, throwing me back into my starting place …</span>

Players who have pre-ordered the game will get to play for two extra days
 Battlefield 2042 is delayed until November, but its beta is still ready for the near future. The beta will run from Oct. 6-9, Electronic Arts and developer DICE announced on Tuesday. 
The open beta will include Battlefield’s signature Conquest mode, but with a slight twist: Two teams will compete to control several flags in certain areas, rather than larger individual control points. The beta will feature the game’s Orbital map, which takes the fight to an active rocket launch site. During the beta, players can choose to play as one of four different specialists, who each more or less represent a traditional Battlefield class and have their own abilities. 
Battlefield 2042 players who have pre-ordered the game will get access to the beta starting on Oct. 6 for an exclusive two-day early access period. The beta will open up for all players starting on Oct. 8. The beta will be available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. PlayStation Plus is not required to participate in the open beta, but if you plan to play on Xbox, you will need an active Xbox Live Gold subscription.
DICE and EA also announced the PC system requirements for the beta, which you can find below:

Meet Mikaela Reid
 Dead by Daylight is a scary game, so it’s appropriate we’re getting an update on the game’s next character as we head into October and towards Halloween. The next content update for Dead by Daylight is Hour of the Witch, and it includes a new Survivor named Mikaela Reid.
We didn’t get a look at Mikaela’s exclusive perks, which change the way each Survivor plays. However, Survivors tend to be much squishier and more vulnerable than Killers, and have very little, if anything, in the way of offensive capabilities. It seems that Mikaela may be able to use her witchy ways to help the team in a support capability, as a tweet by developer Behaviour Interactive reads “She brings light and life to a realm of darkness and death.”

It makes sense to get a new Survivor, as the last addition to the game was Pinhead. The Hellraiser update only contained a Killer. Usually these updates also have a complementary Survivor. While Pinhead is a licensed character, Mikaela appears to be totally original to Dead by Daylight, and she’ll likely have some sort of story that explains how she ended up in the Fog.</span>

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/27/beats-flex-headphones-price-increase/">

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Apple today increased the price of its Beats Flex headphones from $49.99 to $69.99, a pricing shift that may be related to supply chain constraints that have raised the costs of components across the industry.





First released last October, the Beats Flex made headlines at launch because of their low price compared to other Apple headphone options, and they have been a popular purchase option since. The Beats Flex are a follow-up to the BeatsX, and feature an in-ear design with a wire between the left and right earbuds.



Given their low price, the Beats Flex may have been more susceptible to cost pressures than some other Apple products. At $20 more expensive, the Beats Flex are still a very affordable option to get into the Apple headphone ecosystem, but it&#x27;s not quite as impressive a deal as before. They come in Black, Flame Blue, Yuzu Yellow, and Smoke Gray, and offer much of the same seamless connectivity functionality available with Apple&#x27;s more expensive Beats options.



Auto-play/pause is included, and the Beats Flex last for up to 12 hours without needing to be recharged. There&#x27;s a Fast Fuel charging option that offers 1.5 hours of playback, and they feature Find My integration.



The pricing change of the Beats Flex was first noticed by Twitter user Pedro Henrique and was highlighted by 9to5Mac. The Beats Flex can be purchased from the Apple Store, but Amazon currently has them on sale for as low as $37, so those considering a purchase should buy them on Amazon before prices go up.

                    <span>Apple recently introduced the sixth-generation iPad mini, featuring a complete redesign, a larger display, the A15 Bionic chip, and more. The ‌iPad mini‌ now effectively shares the design of the iPad Air, with both devices possessing many of the same features such as an all-screen design with no Home button, Touch ID in the top power button, and stereo speakers.

                    <span>Google today lambasted European Union regulators for ignoring Apple and the rivalry between Apple and Android in the antitrust accusations that have been levied against Google, reports Reuters.





Apple was brought up as part of Google&#x27;s attempt to get a massive 4.34 billion euro ($5.1 billion) fine annulled. The European Commission first levied the fine against Google in 2018 because Google pre-installed its own services (Google Search and the Chrome browser) on Android to ensure its dominance in internet search.



According to Google, the European Commission has ignored the dynamic between Apple and Google and has downplayed the impact that Apple has on the mobile device market.

Prior to taking a look inside the new iPhone, iFixit did X-rays to show off the L-shaped battery, the MagSafe magnet ring, and stabilizing magnets for image sensors and logic boards.



This year&#x27;s iPhone 13 Pro has an upper sensor cable near the top that&#x27;s easy to rip during repairs, with iFixit calling it &quot;scary thin.&quot; Visually, the Taptic Engine inside the device that controls Haptic Touch appears to be smaller, but it&#x27;s actually bulkier than the similar component in the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌, weighing in at 6.3 grams, up from 4.8.

                    <span>Apple has unveiled limited edition Beats Studio3 headphones in partnership with A-COLD-WALL, a fashion brand by British designer Samuel Ross.





The wireless headphones will be available in a slate color with a &quot;speckled cement&quot; finish that covers both the headphones and ear cushions. There&#x27;s an ACW logo on the outside of the headband, while the inside of the headband has a clay color with more A-COLD-WALL branding. The included carrying case is also branded with an ACW logo.



The limited edition Beats are listed as coming soon on Apple&#x27;s online store, with pricing set at $349.95 in the United States.



Apple first released the Beats Studio3 in September 2017 and several limited edition designs have been made available since then. The wireless over-ear headphones feature Apple&#x27;s W1 chip for seamless setup with Apple devices, up to 22 hours of battery life with active noise cancellation enabled, a foldable design, and more. Keep in mind the headphones are four years old and still have Bluetooth 4.0 and a micro USB port for charging.

                    <span>Apple made few design changes to the iPhone 13 lineup and the new devices continue to feature a durable Ceramic Shield front to protect the display, a glass back, and flat edges at the side.






Allstate Protection Plans conducted one of its annual drop tests on the ‌iPhone 13‌ and 13 Pro, and found that due to the similar designs, the ‌iPhone 13‌ models are comparable to the iPhone 12 models when it comes to durability.



In a face-down drop test without a case, the ‌iPhone 13‌ survived a single drop with only minor damage, but it cracked at the top and bottom corners in the second drop test.

                    <span>Ferrari and its parent company Exor today announced a multi-year creative partnership with LoveFrom, the design firm co-founded by Apple&#x27;s former design chief Jony Ive and fellow designer Marc Newson.





&quot;The first expression of this new partnership will bring together Ferrari&#x27;s legendary performance and excellence with LoveFrom&#x27;s unrivalled experience and creativity that has defined extraordinary world changing products,&quot; said Ferrari, in a press release announcing the partnership. &quot;Beyond the collaboration with Ferrari, LoveFrom will explore a range of creative projects with Exor in the business of luxury.&quot;



&quot;As Ferrari owners and collectors, we could not be more excited about collaborating with this extraordinary company and in particular with the design team expertly led by Flavio Manzoni,&quot; said Ive and Newson, in a joint statement. &quot;We see some uniquely exciting opportunities working together which we believe will yield important and valuable work.&quot;



Ive will also join Exor&#x27;s Partners Council, a group that shares ideas with the company and explores potential business opportunities. 



In June 2019, Apple announced that Ive would be departing the company to form LoveFrom. At the time, Apple said that it would remain one of Ive&#x27;s primary clients, but it&#x27;s unclear which Apple products he has helped to design since then, if any. Apple did confirm that Ive was involved in the design of the colorful 24-inch iMac released in April, but Apple did not confirm if any of that work occurred after Ive left the company.



Ive reportedly recruited at least four of his former Apple colleagues to join LoveFrom. Airbnb announced a multi-year partnership with the design firm last year.

                    <span>Following a flood of reports and complaints, Spotify has acknowledged that its app may be causing excessive battery drain and overheating issues on iOS 14.8 and the latest iOS 15 update, promising a fix in the not-so-distant future.





In a long and ongoing support thread on its website, which started weeks ago, Spotify says it is aware of battery drain reports and that it has passed those reports onto its technical iOS team. Spotify doesn&#x27;t state when a fix could be coming or whether it would be an app update or other troubleshooting steps. 



Users reporting the issue on the thread state that Spotify is listed as a consumer of battery life due to background activity, with no clear reason why. While most of the reports are from users running iOS 14.8 and iOS 15.0, there are also other sporadic reports of battery drainage on older iOS versions. Those users are advised to update for a possible patch and improved security. 



While Spotify is being held as the main culprit for the excessive drainage, it could also be a bug in ‌iOS 15‌ for some users. ‌iOS 15‌ has been littered with multiple bugs, including one limiting Apple Watch functionality with the just-released iPhone 13, issues with Apple Music, and other bugs that Apple has promised fixes for. Apple may be planning to release iOS 15.0.1 as soon as this week to patch those issues and others.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Apple today added Guided Meditations and Pilates to Apple Fitness+, expanding the existing catalog of workout types already available on the service ahead of a significant expansion of 15+ additional countries later this year.





During the last Apple event earlier this month, Apple announced it would be expanding Fitness+ with Guided Meditations. This new workout type builds on the current Mindful Cooldowns workout, allowing Fitness+ users to &quot;reduce everyday stress, develop a greater sense of awareness, and build resilience to face life&#x27;s challenges.&quot; Guided Meditations sessions in 10 and 20 minute lengths will be available.



Alongside Strength, Core, and Yoga workouts, Fitness+ today also gained Pilates, a new low-impact workout that focuses on improving strength and flexibility. Pilates sessions will be guided and headed by Marimba Gold-Watts and Darryl Whiting, both professionals in fitness. Fitness+ is also gaining a new &quot;Workouts to Get Ready for Snow Season&quot; guide with workouts to improve skiers&#x27; and snowboarders&#x27; performance ahead of the winter. 



Later this fall, Apple Fitness+ will be expanding to 15 additional countries, including Austria, Brazil, Colombia, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Switzerland, and the UAE. Fitness+ will also be gaining group workouts powered by SharePlay later this year.

                    <span>Now that new iPad mini 6 owners have had a couple of days with Apple&#x27;s latest redesigned tablet, some users are noticing an issue being referred to as &quot;jelly scroll&quot; when viewing the screen in portrait mode.





The term refers to a noticeable effect when scrolling vertically through text-based content like a webpage or document, where each line of text appears to tilt down towards the left of the screen as it passes by. The effect makes it look as though one side of the display is responding faster than the other when a finger drags to scroll the page.



Several MacRumors readers have noted the issue, which seems to affect users to a variable degree. Some ‌iPad mini 6‌ owners claim they noticed the effect despite being ignorant of similar reports in the wild, while others see …</span>

                    <span>Shipments of Apple Silicon MacBooks will be cut in the first half of next year due to component shortages, a decline in working from home demand, and the introduction of a redesigned MacBook Air in the third quarter of 2022, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo&#x27;s latest investor note, seen by MacRumors.





From the note:

We forecast that the shipment of Apple Silicon processor-based MacBook models will be cut by approximately 15% in 1H22 and attribute it to three reasons: 1) component shortages, 2) structural demand change in the post- COVID-19 era, and 3) product transition between legacy and new models. 
According to Kuo, the shortage of components relates primarily to a continuing lack of power management integrated circuits, for which delivery times currently extend as fa…</span>

                    <span>Update: According to the video mentioned below, even if an iPhone 13 display is replaced with a genuine and original ‌iPhone 13‌ screen, Face ID will stop working. In the video, the repair provider swapped two original ‌iPhone 13‌ screens and in both cases, Face ID was inoperative after the new screens were installed. It seems to be the case that if the original screen is put back with the original ‌iPhone 13‌, Face ID returns, ruling out the possibility of an improper installation.



If a customer gets their ‌iPhone 13‌ display replaced by a third-party repair store or provider, such as those not licensed or affiliated with Apple through its Independent Repair Program, Face ID on the iPhone will no longer be useable.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Apple plans to begin mass production of an upcoming redesigned MacBook Air featuring an updated, more powerful Apple silicon processor in the third quarter of 2022, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said today in a research note obtained by MacRumors.





Kuo has previously stated that the new MacBook Air will feature an entirely new design, including a mini-LED display and a more powerful Apple silicon processor. Kuo had earlier pinpointed a launch around the middle of 2022, now providing a more specific timeline for the late second quarter or early third quarter of 2022 for mass production getting underway. 



Bloomberg&#x27;s Mark Gurman has reported that the new MacBook Air will feature a &quot;thinner and lighter&quot; enclosure, two USB 4 ports, and a MagSafe charging connector. Apple leaker and YouTube personality Jon Prosser shared renders for the alleged upcoming MacBook Air earlier this year, showing most notably of all that Apple plans to release the new laptop in a range of colors, similar to the 24-inch M1 iMac. 



Apple last updated its MacBook Air with the M1 chip last November, which maintained the previous MacBook Air design. Despite the expectation that Apple will update several Macs in its lineup with Apple silicon before the end of this year, the MacBook Air doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;ll be one of them.

                    <span>We love messaging (and most of us grew up using IRC.) It’s our favorite way of collaborating, but not if it’s overwhelming and disorganized. We grew exhausted having to skim thousands of messages every day to keep up, so we built something better. A more deliberate way to chat.

                    <span>Apple support document acknowledges a problem a lot of iPhone 13 users are running into:
Apple has identified an issue where Unlock with Apple Watch
may not work with iPhone 13 devices. You might see “Unable to
Communicate with Apple Watch” if you try to unlock your iPhone
while wearing a face mask, or you might not be able to set up
Unlock with Apple Watch.
This issue will be fixed in an upcoming software update. Until the
update is available, you can turn off Unlock with Apple Watch and
use your passcode to unlock your iPhone 13.
I haven’t seen this issue, but I sympathize with those of you who’ve been hit by it. “Unlock With Apple Watch” almost completely mitigates the annoyance of using an iPhone with Face ID while wearing a mask.

One of the Flyers’ newest blueliners is looking to take their current partnership to a different level.
 The idea of chemistry in hockey is something that cannot be easily contributed to anything or quantified in any particular way. Some players just work better together than others and it might not even be a skill level thing; just a general and innate understanding of what the other dude is going to do with the puck, without the puck, on the forecheck, in all three zones — it’s just a thing.
For the Philadelphia Flyers’ newest top-pairing defenseman Ryan Ellis, he views chemistry as being best friends off the ice, and when talking about his new partner Ivan Provorov, he’s attemptin…</span>

A small adventure in an overwhelmingly interesting world
 Many big-budget video games come with a dedicated photo mode these days — a tool designed specifically for capturing a game within a single frame. There’s no real standard for photo modes: Most come with zoom and camera movement, but no two are the same, allowing players to take a breath to capture something with a shutter click. In Toem, developer Something We Made’s game is built around the idea of a photography mode. That’s the whole game.
It’s part of a growing number of photography games that use the act of capturing photos — and noticing environments around the player — as the main function of the game. Before Toem, Umurangi Generation used photography to tell a story of a decaying world; Alba…</span>

 Fans of Microsoft Flight Simulator who play on Xbox Series X will soon have three new controllers to choose from. In addition to the Turtle Beach yoke announced in June, both Thrustmaster and Honeycomb Aeronautical revealed new Xbox-compatible flight control solutions over the weekend. The announcements were made during Flight Sim Expo 2021 in San Diego.
According to FSElite, the Thrustmaster solution will be called the TCA Boeing Yoke Pack, and will be a replica of the controls found in the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. It will include a stand-alone yoke with an all-metal interior structure, plus a separate split throttle. Both will be bundled together in the same box, and b…</span>

Blizzard shows off Bastion and Sombra ability reworks
 Blizzard Entertainment is making some big changes to the heroes of Overwatch for Overwatch 2, including everyone’s favorite point-and-kill turret robot, Bastion. In addition to sporting a baseball cap borrowed from Torbjorn, Bastion’s abilities are being reimagined for Overwatch 2, Blizzard revealed on Saturday evening at the Overwatch League finals.
In the first Overwatch, Bastion could transform from a walking robot (Recon mode) to a stationary turret (Sentry mode), gaining a higher rate of fire and large ammo reserves at the expense of mobility. In Overwatch 2, Bastion will gain the ability to move (albeit at a slower rate) while in turret form. Bastion is also gaining a new ability — a seconda…</span>

                    <span>Apple today said an issue preventing some iPhone 13 users from using the Unlock with Apple Watch feature will be fixed in an upcoming software update.





In a support document, Apple said affected users can turn off Unlock with Apple Watch and use their passcode to unlock their iPhone 13 until the software update is released. The feature, which is designed to let you unlock your iPhone while wearing a mask or ski goggles, can be toggled off in the Settings app under Face ID &amp; Passcode.



Apple did not specify which software update will include a fix, nor did it provide a timeframe. The first beta of iOS 15.1 was released five days ago, but Apple could also choose to release a minor iOS 15.0.1 update with bug fixes.



As we reported, affected users might see an &quot;Unable to Communicate with Apple Watch&quot; error message if they try to unlock their iPhone 13 while wearing a face mask, or they might not be able to set up Unlock with Apple Watch.

A couple free agency acquisitions are stoked as hell.
 Claude Giroux’s contract is on the mind of every single Philadelphia Flyers fan and staff member as they head into an all-important season to show that last year’s tumble down the standings was a fluke. It is the final year of the captain’s eight-year contract extension signed way back in 2013.
And while the contract talk between Flyers GM Chuck Fletcher and Giroux will be had a later date, letting this season play out to determine where to go from here with one of the franchise’s most beloved stars.
The general feeling is not a matter of if they are going to sign him, but for how long and how much. Especially considering just how damn respected he is around his locker room…</span>

This week also saw some new rumors, including a fresh report about next year&#x27;s iPhone 14 Pro and our own discovery of what are likely to be the display resolutions for Apple&#x27;s upcoming redesigned MacBook Pro models, so read on for all of the details!

                    <span>After developers discovered that their apps are not currently able to use 120Hz ProMotion refresh rates for all animations, there was confusion over whether it was a limitation imposed for battery life or a bug. Apple has now provided clarification.





Apple told MacRumors that all third-party apps can take full advantage of 120Hz ProMotion refresh rates, but developers will need to declare that their apps use higher frame rates by adding an entry to their app&#x27;s plist. Documentation on the required plist entry will be made available to developers soon.



Apple is requiring this opt-in step to provide higher fresh rates only to apps that will benefit from the technology, which will optimize battery life on iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max devices.

                    <span>YouTuber Arun “Mrwhosetheboss” Maini’s full battery life drain test of the iPhone 13 Pro Max, iPhone 13 Pro, iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Mini, iPhone 12, iPhone 11, and iPhone SE. Interesting results that jibe with Apple’s claims about the improvements to battery life in the iPhones 13.
Via Avi Greengart, who observes the most impressive result:
It’s worth watching Arun’s whole video, but the iPhone 13 mini
handily beats last year’s full-sized iPhone 12 on battery life,
making it an easy recommendation for anyone with human-sized
hands. The entire iPhone 13 line has genuinely good to
extraordinary battery life.
The iPhone 13 Mini has longer battery life than last year’s regular iPhone 12. That’s a game-changer for those who want the Mini size.

                    <span>MacOS 12 Monterey is not out yet — and, I hope, won’t ship until after a few more weeks of much-needed bug fixes — but Safari 15 for MacOS 11 Big Sur shipped last week. I strongly recommend not upgrading, unless you’ve already tried the new tab design and like it, or at least feel ambivalent about it. Updates like this are why I always turn off “Automatically keep my Mac up to date” in System Preferences → Software Update.
The sole reason I recommend not upgrading to Safari 15 is the new tab bar design. You can easily try it out for yourself, though, without upgrading to Safari 15 or installing the MacOS 12 betas. Safari Technology Preview is a separate version of Safari you can easily install next to regular Safari. Typically it’s used by web developers to test in-progress changes to WebKit, but right now it’s more useful as a way to preview the new Safari 15 tab design. It’s easy to install and easy to uninstall. You can even set it as your default web browser while testing in System Preferences: General.

                    <span>Laura Olin is right; this recorded lunch conversation with Orson Welles from 1983 is well worth a read. I mean:
Waiter: Gentlemen, bon appétit. How is everything?
O.W.: We’re talking, thank you. [Waiter leaves.] I wish they wouldn’t do that. If I ever own a restaurant, I will never allow the waiters to ask if the diners like their dishes. Particularly when they’re talking.
H.J.: What is wrong with your food?
O.W.: It’s not what I had yesterday.
H.J.: You want to try to explain this to the waiter?
O.W.: No, no, no. One complaint per table is all, unless you want them to spit in the food. Let me tell you a story about George Jean Nathan, America’s great drama critic. Nathan was the tightest man who ever lived, even tighter than Charles Chaplin. And he lived for 40 years in the Hotel Royalton…</span>

                    <span>I don’t know if a 10-second sequence of a plane landing in one of Brian De Palma’s worst films properly qualifies as “The Most Difficult Shot in Movie History”, but the story behind it is genuinely interesting. The logistics of having only 30 seconds out of an entire year to get this exact shot of the setting sun and coordinating that with a landing supersonic jet at one of the world’s busiest airports are certainly daunting. As Patrick Willems notes in his commentary, this shot also signifies the end of an era in the film industry.

                    <span>As part of the Great Green Wall initiative, Senegal has been building circular, drought-resistant gardens to keep the Sahara desert from spreading any further. The Kid Should See This explains how they work:
These Senegalese farmers plant the spiraling gardens with a plan to hold water: Medicinal plants in the inner circle, three rows of vegetables, with fruit and nut trees next. The outer circles are created with large baobab trees and African mahogany trees.

                    <span>The new iPhone 13 Pro models that launched today are equipped with ProMotion display technology, which allows for adaptive refresh rates ranging from 10Hz all the way to 120Hz, which is ideal for scrolling through content, gaming, and more, because it makes for a smoother viewing experience.





Though there&#x27;s a 120Hz maximum refresh rate, App Store developers have found that most app animations are limited to 60Hz, which results in an uneven viewing experience for users. As noted by 9to5Mac, ProMotion works at the full 120Hz for scrolling and full-screen transitions, but animations are limited to 60Hz.



So when you&#x27;re scrolling through your Twitter timeline, for example, you&#x27;ll see the smooth ProMotion experience, but animations at 60Hz mean other interactions are noticeably …</span>

                    <span>With the launch of the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max, Apple introduced Macro mode, a new camera feature that&#x27;s exclusive to the Pro models and brings the immensely detailed world of close-up macro photography to iPhones for the first time. Keep reading to learn how it works.





With Macro mode enabled, you can take pictures or video of subjects that are as close as 2cm to your iPhone&#x27;s camera lens, which means you can now take shots of flowers, textures, insects, or pretty much anything small or at close distance, with accurate focus, rich detail, and no blurring.



Here&#x27;s how to use the Macro mode feature on ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ Max. Bear in mind that Macro mode is exclusive to these models and isn&#x27;t supported on iPhone 13 mini or ‌iPhone 13‌.

Apple&#x27;s ‌iPhone 13‌ models have more environmentally friendly packaging, so you just need to pop open the box and your iPhone is right there with no more protective plastic. There are a few papers, a SIM ejection tool, and a Lightning to USB-C cable. No charger or EarPods, of course, because Apple dropped those last year.

                    <span>Apple this week opened its newest Apple Store in New York City, Apple The Mall at Bay Plaza, which also happens to be the first Apple retail location in the Bronx.





‌Apple Store‌ aficionado Michael Steeber teamed up with Storeteller for a virtual 360-degree walkthrough of the new location, giving us an in-depth look at the features and improvements that Apple has brought to its latest ‌Apple Store‌.



Apple The Mall at Bay Plaza may look similar to most other Apple retail locations, but it has a unique feature - a dedicated Pickup Zone. The Pickup Zone is a permanent installation within the store, featuring a dedicated table where customers can get their new devices from employees and more interestingly, a wall of built-in drawers where all the pickup orders are housed.





In most Apple retail locations, employees must go to the back to retrieve orders that have been placed for in-store pickup, but that won&#x27;t be the case with Apple The Mall at Bay Plaza, and it is the first store with this setup rather than a Forum area.



Along with the Pickup Zone, the store also features an area with round tables for training, and a series of Forum displays. There are leather seats along the walls for those waiting for Genius Bar appointments, and the front of the store is outfitted with sliding glass doors.



Make sure to check out the full store walkthrough to get a feel for the new design.

                    <span>iFixit is gearing up for one of traditional teardowns of the new iPhone 13 models, but ahead of that full teardown, iFixit has done a live event to give us a first glimpse inside the refreshed devices.






As we&#x27;ve seen in prior inside looks, the new iPhones have smaller, square-shaped Taptic Engines, and the iPhone 13 Pro has a smaller, denser logic board than the ‌iPhone 13‌ along with an L-shaped battery and a larger internal camera module.



Battery capacities were unveiled earlier today, and ‌iPhone 13‌ models have larger batteries across the board. The ‌iPhone 13‌ mini has a 2,406 mAh battery, the ‌iPhone 13‌ has a 3,227 mAh battery, the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ has a 3,095 mAh battery, and the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ Max has a 4,352 mAh battery.



iFixit&#x27;s live teardown is interesting for those who want to see a step-by-step deconstruction of the device, but there&#x27;s not a lot of new information to learn at this point. iFixit plans to publish a more in-depth teardown next week, which should give us some more insight on the internal components.

                    <span>For this week&#x27;s giveaway, we&#x27;ve teamed up with Lululook to offer MacRumors readers a chance to win an Urban Magnetic iPad Stand that turns an iPad Pro or an iPad Air into a little iMac for a desktop setup.





As the name suggests, the Urban iPad Stand has a strong built-in magnet that&#x27;s designed to attach to a compatible ‌iPad‌. Like the iPhone and a MagSafe charger, the ‌iPad‌ and the stand automatically align with one another.





Once on the stand, the ‌iPad‌ is at an ideal height to provide an ergonomic viewing experience, and with the adjustable hinge at the back, it can be rotated around 360 degrees to any viewing angle that works best for you. It&#x27;s useful for watching movies, working with a keyboard and mouse, drawing, and more.

                    <span>In 2019, Apple opened its Security Bounty Program to the public, offering payouts up to $1 million to researchers who share critical iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, or watchOS security vulnerabilities with Apple, including the techniques used to exploit them. The program is designed to help Apple keep its software platforms as safe as possible.





In the time since, reports have surfaced indicating that some security researchers are unhappy with the program, and now a security researcher who uses the pseudonym &quot;illusionofchaos&quot; has shared their similarly &quot;frustrating experience.&quot;



In a blog post highlighted by Kosta Eleftheriou, the unnamed security researcher said they reported four zero-day vulnerabilities to Apple between March and May of this year, but they said that three of t…</span>

                    <span>Arun Maini today shared a new iPhone battery life test on his YouTube channel Mrwhosetheboss, timing how long all four iPhone 13 models last on a single charge compared to older iPhone models. Maini said all of the iPhones had 100% battery health and were set to an equivalent brightness, and each iPhone was subjected to the same usage.





While the test is not scientific, and might not perfectly reflect real-world usage, the video still provides us with a good idea of how the new iPhone 13 models stack up to previous generations in terms of battery life.



The winning device in the test was the iPhone 13 Pro Max, which achieved an impressive 9 hours and 52 minutes of battery life with continuous usage. Maini said this is the longest battery life of any iPhone that he has ever …</span>

                    <span>With the launch of the iPhone 13 series, Apple introduced several new camera features that take advantage of the A15 Bionic processor and advanced machine learning. One of these is called Cinematic Mode. This article explains what Cinematic Mode is and how to use it.





What is Cinematic Mode?


Cinematic Mode utilizes Dolby Vision HDR and a technique called &quot;rack focus&quot; to seamlessly shift the focus from one subject to another when you&#x27;re shooting video. It does this by locking the focus on the subject in a scene and blurring the background to achieve depth of field. If you subsequently move the camera to center on a new subject or a new subject enters the scene, Cinematic mode automatically switches the focal point to this new subject and blurs out the background.

As outlined on Reddit, after receiving an ‌iPhone 13‌, some customers cannot toggle on the &quot;Unlock with Apple Watch&quot; feature, allowing users to unlock their iPhones while wearing a mask thanks to their Apple Watch. When attempting to activate the feature, some customers are prompted with an &quot;Unable to communicate with Apple Watch&quot; prompt, with no clear solution.

                    <span>When Apple announced the new iPhone 13 series, it also introduced several new camera features, including Photographic Styles for photos and Cinematic mode for shooting video. In this article, we take a look at what Photographic Styles are and how to use them.





Photographic Styles consist of a series of subtle filter-like adjustments that you can enable before you&#x27;ve taken any photos, allowing you to bring a stylistic effect to your shots beforehand that won&#x27;t affect the skin tone of your subjects. These styles come in four presets: Vibrant, Rich Contrast, Warm, and Cool. 



Vibrant captures the shot in bright, vivid, yet natural-looking colors, while Rich Contrast adds a more dramatic look that makes shadows darker and increases color and contrast. Warm adds a summery golden…</span>

                    <span>Launch day has arrived for all four iPhone 13 models in over 30 countries, marking the start of in-store availability of the devices.





In countries such as the United States, Canada, and the UK, some iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro configurations are available for same-day pickup at select Apple Stores as of the time this story was published. Apple Store pickup is the best option for customers who did not pre-order an iPhone 13 model, as placing an order through Apple&#x27;s online store today could result in a lengthy wait time of 4-6 weeks for delivery.



To check if an iPhone 13 model is available for Apple Store pickup, head to the iPhone 13 or iPhone 13 Pro order page, configure the iPhone as you would like it, and look for a &quot;Pickup&quot; option towards the bottom of the page. A link below the &quot;Pickup&quot; option leads to an iPhone Availability tool, which displays iPhone 13 models available for pickup at nearby Apple Stores based on the zip code or postal code that you enter.



Key features across all four iPhone 13 models include a faster A15 Bionic chip, camera improvements, longer battery life, and a smaller notch. The two Pro models also feature a ProMotion display with a variable refresh rate up to 120Hz, up to 1TB of storage, and additional camera features like Night mode portraits and ProRes video recording.



In the United States, starting prices are the same as they were for the iPhone 12 lineup, including $699 for the iPhone 13 mini, $799 for the iPhone 13, $999 for the iPhone 13 Pro, and $1,099 for the iPhone 13 Pro Max.



The sixth-generation iPad mini and ninth-generation iPad are also available for same-day pickup at select Apple Stores starting today.

The rumor originating from Dylandkt claims that a future version of the ‌iPad Pro‌ will include a horizontal camera layout and a landscape Apple logo on the back.

During Apple&#x27;s fully-digital &quot;California streaming&quot; event on September 14, which included no physical audience attendance in Cupertino in favor of pre-recorded segments live-streamed, the EFF decided to fly a plane over ‌Apple Park‌ with the message &quot;Apple: Don&#x27;t scan our phones!

Held at Catalyst Nightclub, the show was sold-out with fans lining up an hour before doors, and the […]

                    <span>Sponsorships have been selling briskly this year, but I’ve only just now opened spots for the October-December quarter. Plus, a last-minute change has opened up next week’s spot, starting this coming Monday.
One sponsor per week, with a sponsor-written entry in the RSS feed to start the week, a thank-you post right on the homepage from me at the end, and the one and only graphic ad on every page of the site all week long. No tracking or other privacy-invasive bullshit. Just plain honest ads. That’s not new — that’s the way the ads on DF have always been. My best argument that they work: the number of repeat companies in the sponsor archive list.
So if you’ve got a product or service you’d like to promote to DF’s discerning audience, I’d love to have you as a sponsor. And if you’re ready to grab next week’s opening, let’s go — should be another good week.

                    <span>I shot this video while walking past the Philly Apple Store at 2 pm. The line went most of the way down the block. I’ll bet the line was longer than it would have been without COVID restrictions, but still — this is the 15th generation of iPhones and people are still lining up to buy them on the day they’re available. And how many more people had them delivered today, waking up early a week ago to preorder the moment the online store came online? People love iPhone. If you look at it solely as a technology product you’re missing the biggest part of the iPhone story. iPhone Day is a de facto annual holiday for untold millions of people around the world.
That’s not true of any other product in the world.

                    <span>Alex Kantrowitz, writing for CNBC:
“Just completely running blind” is how Aaron Paul, a performance
Facebook marketer, described it. Paul said his company, Carousel,
moved from spending millions of dollars each day on Facebook to a
few hundred thousand dollars. Before the iOS changes, Facebook
generated 80% of the traffic Carousel sent to its product pages.
Now it accounts for 20%.
Apple’s iOS changes may lead to irreparable harm to Facebook’s ad
business. This moment has demonstrated to Paul and his fellow
performance buyers that relying on one channel (albeit a very
effective one) is risky. So they’re looking to diversify their ad
spend. Paul said he’s moved his ad budget elsewhere, including
“Snapchat and TikTok, but also silent killers like email.” On
Twitter, Facebook marketers discussing Apple’s changes
almost unanimously agreed they needed to follow suit.

Nothing’s changing at typography.com, where you’ll still find all
1,113 fonts in the Hoefler&amp;Co library, as well as the
cloud.typography webfont service, and all the other resources
we’ve created for designers and brands. The H&amp;Co team is staying
in place, too, and there are yet more typefaces from us that you
can look forward to seeing soon. […]
In the meantime, I’ll be stepping down from my role in the
company, to finally make the time to recharge, reflect, and
explore some new ideas. In these past few years, participating in
a documentary and using typography to help elect a
president have been potent reminders of just how many ways
there are for type to make a difference, and just how many people
are moved by the splendor of typography.
I’d need 144-point type to express my surprise at this announcement.

If this doesn’t move you, you’re not hooked up right. Good god, what a powerful, lovely, beautiful short film. Headphones and full screen — this deserves your attention. I take it back, Cinematic mode — which Larrow used to shoot this — is no gimmick at all.
This is just astonishing. Remember Aundre Larrow’s name.

                    <span>A bunch of you are probably getting new iPhones (and iPads) today. As someone who’s set up 5 new devices in the last week, my advice is to restore a new iPhone with the Quick Start device-to-device transfer, not iCloud backup. Don’t worry if it says it might take a little longer this way, it’s worth it. Get a cup of coffee or a bite to eat. A watched pot never boils; a watched transfer never finishes.
Device-to-device is better because it moves over all your login credentials. When you restore from an iCloud backup, you wind up logged out of a lot of apps on the new device. When you restore device-to-device, almost everything moves over. I know there are exceptions, but I don’t think I bounced into a single app that didn’t keep me fully logged in this week. If you tried device-to-device a few years ago and found it lacking, try it again now — Apple has improved this process every year since it debuted. Worst case scenario, you can always start over and use iCloud backup.
Also, you do not need to unpair your Apple Watch from your old iPhone using this method. You can just wear your watch the whole time. When the transfer is complete, the new iPhone will prompt you, asking if you want to move your watch to the new iPhone. Your mileage may vary but it just worked for me.
I posted this on Twitter tonight, and realized I should post about this here too. The Twitter thread has a bunch of Q&amp;A’s about specific apps, like authentication tokens in Authy (they transfer fine).

                    <span>Italians who don’t know how to have fun released a new EP! I remember this band since they released their debut 1 sided LP… and must say that new material is f***g amazing! With each new release, the powerviolence of this band becomes stronger and stronger. Don&#x60;t be fooled with such simple cover art… the main hell is inside! When the needle touches that pink (yep the record is pink) surface, uhhh, everything begins. This music is so intensive, fast, and ridiculously angry, damn, I love it! It&#x60;s a huge punch right into your face, ha! “II” has all attributes …</span>

                    <span>Hello! On Wednesday I was talking to a friend about how it would be cool to
have an nginx playground website where you can just paste in an nginx config
and test it out. And then I realized it might actually be pretty easy to build,
so got excited and started coding and I built it. It’s at
https://nginx-playground.wizardzines.com.
Here’s a screenshot:

For the rest of the post I’m mostly going to talk about how I built the
project, because there were a few decisions that weren’t obvious to me.
how to use it
You need to enter both an nginx config and a curl or http command to make a
HTTP request to that nginx instance
And then you click “Run” in the top right, and it’ll output either:
the results of the command you executed (if nginx started successfully), or

Those 27 games? I wouldn’t worry too much about those 27 little games last year. 
 No. 1: Carter Hart
2020-21 League/Team(s): Flyers/Phantoms
2020-21 Statistics: .877 SV%, 3.67 GAA, 27 games
Age: 23
Acquired In: 2016 NHL Entry Draft, 52nd overall
Ranking in Spring 2020 25 Under 25: 2
How did Hart’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
So Carter Hart graded out as perhaps the worst starting goaltender in the NHL in 2020-21. 
Now that’s out of the way, we can get into why he’s still the Flyers’ top prospect under 25 years of age by unpacking a bit of what went wrong last season and why the 27-game sample size falls where it does.
We’ve already addressed how bizarre the 2020-2…</span>

News flash: he is good at hockey. 
 No. 2: Joel Farabee
2020-21 League/Team(s): Philadelphia Flyers (NHL)
2020-21 Statistics: 55 GP, 20 G, 18 A, 38 PTS
Age: 21
Acquired In:  2018 (Draft, Round 1, #14 overall)
Ranking in Spring 2020 25 Under 25: 6
How did Farabee’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
This quote from our season review of Farabee is quite telling of his 2020-21 season:
If one considers Farabee’s rookie season a success, comparatively in a year devoid of standout performances, his sophomore season is a highlight. At just twenty years old, playing in the top six, it appears that only the sky is the limit for the Syracuse native.

He led the Flyers, and the league for…</span>

*If nothing else, training camp is when lingering questions begin to be answered heading into the season. It’s going to be a fun couple of weeks. [Inquirer]
*Like the rest of us, Alain Vigneault isn’t interested in talking about last season anymore. It’s This Season now. [NBC Sports Philly]
*The 25 Under 25 is coming to a close, which means we are getting to the Big Boys. Morgan Frost has a big time opportunity to make himself a roster regular this year, and he clocked in at number five. [BSH]

If you haven’t played Aria of Sorrow yet, now is the time
 I adore Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. It defined the Metroidvania genre, and no other Castlevania game has ever topped its enormous scope. And yet, when people ask me for my favorite game in the series, I don’t point to a symphony — I point to an aria.
Each of the three Game Boy Advance Castlevania games were inspired by the exploration-first gameplay of Symphony of the Night, to varying degrees of success. Of those first two games, 2001’s Circle of the Moon handily bests 2002’s Harmony of Dissonance, but neither could hold a whippable candle to the PlayStation inspiration that came before. They are enjoyable, even today, but they’re not games I often relish returning to. In hindsight, it tu…</span>

Pixel artist Lux redesigned 80 meal sprites
 Food has always been cute in Stardew Valley, the popular farming sim developed by Eric Barone. A new food mod adds more realistic, charming details to Stardew Valley’s meal sprites, and puts them in an isometric perspective. The mod designer, who goes by Lux on Twitter, has redesigned 80 of Stardew Valley’s cooked meal items. And while the classic sprites have always looked cheery, this is the first time I’ve seen a mod that makes me literally want to eat these meals — especially given the, erm, interesting way you acquire some of them.

An old game, mastered by dedicated players
 The scene in front of me is hectic. There are hundreds of people crowded together in a valley, gathering in a chokepoint that leads to a winter pass. They’ve been waiting there for hours, and they will be waiting for hours more, hoping for a chance to fight a big bad boss. These people aren’t united in that goal — in fact, it’s a competition, and one that requires an absurd amount of time, focus, and dedication. But they are united in doing it for a worthy cause.
In an ongoing series of back-and-forth battles, hundreds of people have assembled on a private server of EverQuest to raise funds for a family devastated by Hurricane Ida. The family’s home sustained major flood damage, and the money will be used to “purcha…</span>

                    <span>The Diamond is a contemplative short documentary by Caitlyn Greene about the people who look for diamonds in an ancient volcanic crater at the Crater of Diamonds State Park in Arkansas. Whatever you find there, you can keep. But what are they really searching for?
I came across an article about the Crater of Diamonds State Park in Arkansas, which I learned is the world’s only public diamond-bearing site. People from all walks of life search for diamonds atop this ancient volcanic crater, and it’s finders keepers. Some people find substantial diamonds, some don’t, and either way, it takes a lot of digging in the dirt. I was immediately hooked on the metaphor of this place.
I was interested in the hope of treasure, the grittiness of searching, and what people there were actually looking for in their lives. Creatively, I wanted to push an interview-driven piece, especially one in which subjects are given freedom to take you where they want to go, rather than guiding interviews along a plot-driven track. Errol Morris’ Vernon, Florida was a huge inspiration for this approach.


That loudspeaker announcement right at the beginning is surreal — a great way to set the tone for the rest of the film.

                    <span>Marcella Giulia Pace photographed the Moon in 48 different hues and arranged them in a lovely spiral pattern.
I have collected some of my Full Moon shots taken over the past 10 years. I selected the shades of color with which the Moon was filmed in front of my lens and my eyes.
The atmosphere gives different colors to our satellite (scattering) based on its height with respect to the horizon, based on the presence of humidity or suspended dust. The shape of the Moon also changes: at the bottom of the horizon, refraction compresses the lunar disk at the poles and makes it look like an ellipse.

                    <span>Ice Ball is a short documentary that follows legendary polar explorer Will Steger and the community that he’s built up around harvesting ice from frozen winter lakes near Ely in northern Minnesota. Steger lives off the grid and uses the harvested ice for refrigeration — the ice keeps everything cool in the ice house for the whole year, until the next harvest.
Best known for his legendary polar explorations, Will Steger’s life work grew out of a single log cabin he built after moving to the Minnesotan wilderness at age 25. Reliant on sustainable energy and natural commodities, Steger formed a community and culture based on the principle of mutuality. Central to Steger’s operation is the lost art of cutting ice for refrigeration. This annual harvest formed a tradition spanning fifty years that became known as the “Ice Ball”. While this old world technology inevitably became obsolete, its disappearance parallels a concerning loss of social interdependence in modern society.


Come for the ice harvesting, stay for the wonderful Minnesotan accents. (via colossal)

                    <span>In this video, Michael Pollan explains how caffeine is woven into the fabric of modern society. Here’s the short version of how that came to be: People used to drink a lot of alcohol because water was unsafe, so folks were often in a sort of low-grade stupor. When coffee hit Europe, it provided the stimulation, focus, and energy necessary for people to work better and longer. Voila, the Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution.
You can read more about caffeine in Pollan’s latest book This Is Your Mind on Plants (excerpt here) or in his 2020 audiobook called Caffeine: How Caffeine Created the Modern World.

The best way to extract the most out of the smallest iPad is to
think of it as a device enhanced by non-keyboard input methods — Scribble with Pencil, snapping photos with the cameras, or
using Siri/voice input. The improved “Scribble” allows you to
make notes, do quick searches, and even find directions. It is a
very addictive way to use the iPad, especially in the smaller
size. […]
The more I use the device, the more I realize that most computing
has been defined by a singular idea of work and productivity.
Mobile devices have and will continue to redefine our work. In the
past, most of the computing involved being in the office. Now,
non-office tasks have access to computing resources and thus offer

                    <span>Carolina Milanesi, on Twitter:
I had the opportunity to see the new @surface devices live … and I
am so glad I did.
Holding #SurfaceDuo in my hand, seeing the clever case that
secures the #SurfacePen that looks like a finish rather than a
case not adding any thickness, the fluidity of the screen and
the clever gaming controls…. Very much looking forward to giving
it a spin!
Amen to this enthusiasm for seeing the product introduction live. I get it why Apple did not hold an in-person press event last week — iPhone events are huge, and while I think small events can safely be held in person now, there’s no practical way to shrink the iPhone event.
I miss having hands-on time with new devices as soon as keynotes end. You pick up on things immediately: that something is heavier or lighter than you expected. That certain colors or finishes look different. Remember the Jet Black iPhone 7? You had to see it in person to understand how it looked. And I miss in-person briefings, both official ones and unofficial. In-person communication simply cannot be beaten for conveying subtlety.
Product reviews are hampered too. With in-person Apple events, most reviewers get kit in the hours after the keynote ends. With virtual Apple events, the kit ships for delivery the next day. An extra day makes a big difference when the review embargo drops just one week after the event.

                    <span>Nice supercut video from The Verge squeezing Microsoft’s Surface event yesterday into eight minutes. A few thoughts:
It seems like Microsoft is letting the Surface division stand on its own, brand-wise. They’re not distancing themselves from Microsoft in any way, but branding-wise they’re just letting the products be the “Surface Whatever”, not the “Microsoft Surface Whatever”. There’s even a moment in the event, regarding the folding Duo 2 phone, when a guy says it has “the most precise and reliable hinge mechanism ever engineered at Surface”. I.e. that it was “Surface” who engineered that hinge, not “Microsoft”. I think Surface works as a Microsoft sub-brand like that.
Speaking of the Surface Duo 2 — their folding phone with two screens — they’re now just calling it what they should have called it all along: a phone. It’s a very interesting and unique form factor, but it’s a big folding phone, not a small folding tablet. It supposedly has real cameras this time, too. Starting price: $1,500.
The new Surface Laptop Studio looks really dumb to me. I don’t understand why one would ever want to use it in either of the new folding positions. I guess maybe if you really want to draw on it, you might want to fold it flat, but if you really want to draw that much, why not buy the Surface Pro 8 that detaches from the keyboard? This design just seems dumb.
The Surface Slim Pen 2 introduces haptic feedback, to simulate the feel of a pen on paper. I love stuff like that.

                    <span>Joe Rossignol, reporting for MacRumors:
Apple Watch Series 7 models are equipped with a new module that
enables 60.5GHz wireless data transfer, according to FCC
filings viewed by MacRumors, but this functionality may be
reserved for Apple’s internal use only for now.
The filings indicate that the 60.5GHz module is only activated
when the Apple Watch is placed on a proprietary magnetic dock with
a corresponding 60.5GHz module, but this dock will likely be
reserved for use by Apple employees. For example, it’s possible
that Apple Stores might use the dock to wirelessly restore an
Apple Watch, and if so, it will be interesting to see if Series 7
models still have a hidden diagnostic port for wired connectivity.
This is a little interesting in and of itself. But if you look at the long-term trend, it’s a sign that Apple — along with the rest of the industry — is moving toward wireless technology for both charging and data transfer. Apple Watch exemplifies that — it’s never had a port, either for charging or data. There’s a diagnostic port hidden inside the bottom channel for the watch strap, but those diagnostics are neither charging nor data.
It’s long been my guess that iPhone is never going to support USB-C. I think it’s Apple’s intention to go straight from Lightning to wireless/inductive, with no “port”. Portless is the future for all devices. Yet the product design geniuses at the European Commission want to mandate all devices have one specific port in 2024 and indefinitely thereafter — a port that by that time will already be 10 years old.

The European Union unveiled plans on Thursday to make USB-C
connectors the standard charging port for all smartphones, tablets

that it says will reduce environmental waste but that is likely to
hit Apple the hardest.
The move would represent a long-awaited yet aggressive step into
product-making decisions by the European Commission, the bloc’s
executive arm. Apple, whose iPhones are equipped with a different
port, has long opposed the plan, arguing that it would stifle
innovation and lead to more electronic waste as all current
chargers that are not USB-C would become obsolete. […]

                    <span>No big deal — just a safari expedition to Tanzania. Lions, leopards, giraffes. Ultra wide angle 4K 60 video shot from an iPhone 13 Pro mounted to a helicopter. Your typical iPhone camera review.
The review starts with a terrific movie — including some truly pro-looking Cinematic mode shots — by Taylor McKay.
I thought this was a pretty interesting observation from Mann:
Although the iPhone 13 Pro still only has three lenses, the
addition of macro capability is like adding a new lens altogether,
and for the serious photographer I think it’s perhaps the
strongest advancement in this year’s camera system. […]
Photographer or not, you’ve seen the big and heavy backpacks
photographers carry with them on every shoot. Whether it’s local
or international, we lug these bags full of lenses around because
each one offers a new perspective on whatever story it is that
we’re telling.
As a photographer passionate about the natural world, I carry a
macro lens with me no matter what project I’m working on, just
because I never know what tiny detail of interest might present
itself. Now with the macro capability of the iPhone 13 Pro, I feel
like I have my “in-a-pinch” macro shots covered and I can leave
the rarely-used macro lens at home.
Everything you see in this video was shot with a $1,000 device meant to fit in your pocket.
Some great iOS 15 tips from Mann, too, including using the new Focus feature to create a custom “Shoot Mode” with no notifications whenever he’s using the Camera app or Halide. Also, Mann’s custom Photographic Style settings.

                    <span>Great interview by Matthew Panzarino with Apple vice president Kaiann Drance and human interface designer Johnnie Manzari from Apple’s Camera team:
That’s not even counting tracking shots, where a focus puller is
continually adjusting focus as the camera moves and even the
subject moves in relation to the camera. It’s a highly skilled
operation. To pull off a tracking shot, a focus puller must
practice and train extensively for years. This, Manzari says, is
where Apple sees an opportunity.
“We feel like this is the kind of thing that Apple tackles the
best. To take something difficult and conventionally hard to
learn, and then turn it into something automatic and simple.”
So the team started working through the technical problems in
finding focus, locking focus and racking focus. And these…</span>

                    <span>Judd Legum, writing at Popular Information:
On Friday, CEO Tim Cook answered a question about Apple’s stance
on the Texas ban at an all-staff meeting. Cook said that “the
company was looking into whether it could aid the legal fight
against the new law.”
Apple has considerable leverage over the abortion debate in Texas
and across the country — but it is not related to its ability to
pay for lawyers. Apple’s leverage rests in its status as a major
employer and driver of economic growth.
If Apple believes that its employees should be able to “make their
own decisions regarding their reproductive health,” it could
publicly state that it will not expand its workforce in states
that limit abortion rights. That would have a major influence not
only in Texas but in numerous states considering following Texas’
lead.
Last week, TechCrunch published the text of a company-wide memo posted to an internal Apple message board regarding Texas’s near-outlawing of abortion. It began:
A message about women’s reproductive health care
At Apple, we support our employees’ rights to make their own
decisions regarding their reproductive health.
Legum is right — it’s untenable for Apple, or any other company, to “support our employees’ rights to make their own decisions regarding their reproductive health” and ask any woman to work for the company in a state with a law like Texas’s. An immediate hiring and construction freeze in Texas — explicitly tied to this outrageous law (which makes no exceptions for rape or incest) — is the only tenable action compatible with Apple’s stated values.
David Simon, linking to Legum’s post:
If an employer, this is beyond politics. I’m turning in scripts
next month on an HBO non-fiction miniseries based on events in
Texas, but I can’t and won’t ask female cast/crew to forgo civil
liberties to film there. What else looks like Dallas/Ft. Worth?
That’s the answer. You move your business out of Texas. Any company that expands or initiates new operations in Texas implicitly supports Texas’s abortion ban.

Guys are playing blackened crust with strong influences from Tragedy, M40, and mode aggressive crust like Vision of War. This tape has a typical design for the crust genre. Black and white colors, the image of the huge factory that is polluting our air, and so on. Looks like guys printed these cassettes only for friends and for promotion because there were made only 30 copies. Anyway despite the modesty, the release looks good.

In which the gang gets pumped about training camp. 
 The offseason is official over and training camp is underway! As such, the gang is naturally talking about... injuries. The Flyers cannot simply exist, they must always be mired in turmoil. Injuries, potential lineups, and line combos at the first day of camp; get ready, fam. The season is upon us.</span>

The sturdy Russian took a step back in 2020-21, but might have a breakout on the horizon.
 No. 3: Ivan Provorov
2020-21 League/Team(s): Philadelphia Flyers (NHL)
2020-21 Statistics: 7 G, 19 A, 26 P in 56 GP (NHL)

Ranking in Spring 2020 25 Under 25: 3
How did Provorov’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
Provorov had a letdown after losing defensive partner Matt Niskanen to retirement, never really finding his rhythm and looking like the possibly transformative defender that everybody hoped he became in 2019-20. His stock is trending down, not in that he’s trending down as a player but more in the sense that our expanded set of data on his play has re…</span>

Philly’s resident pest had a quiet 2020-21 season.

Ranking in Spring 2020 25 Under 25: 4
How did Konecny’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
TK didn’t have a stellar 2020-21, continuing a downward trend that began in the COVID-19 bubble playoffs. After a huge breakout via leading the team in points, fans expected Konecny to produce like a top line player, and he failed to deliver anything outside of the odd offensive explosion. There are caveats behind why his performance wasn’t up to the lofty predictions 2019-20 warranted, but all the same…</span>

How did Frost’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
Everybody’s favorite Soo Greyhounds product had a difficult year in the pandemic. What was once a promising season for Frost turned disastrous after a devastating shoulder injury sidelined him indefinitely, eventually ruling him out for the entirety of Philly’s 2020-21 campaign. It was a particular shame given that Frost had a solid shot to become a full-time NHL playe…</span>

 *Training Camp Day is upon us, pals. The excitement is palpable. Say hello to the newest Flyers, Jon-Randall Avon! The Flyers gave him an ELC yesterday. [Flyers]
*If you, like many, are saying to yourself, “Whomst?” fear not! Here’s some insight into who this guy is. [NBC Sports Philly]
*This new guy almost certainly won’t figure into the mix, but with all of these preseason injuries, it’ll be interesting to see who steps up to fill those holes. [BSH]
*Sammy took a stab at trying to figure it out. [Inquirer]
*Always an outstanding read, Charlie’s state of the franchise report asks the question: is this a team poised to be Actually Good again? [The Athletic]
*25 Under 25 rundown! One of the newer draftees found himself quite high on this year’s list at number eight. [BSH]
*At seven, everyone’s current favorite rookie, Wade Allison. [BSH]
*And juuuuust short of the top five, promising young ginger defenseman Cam York. [BSH]
*Let’s take a look around the Metro Division’ defense corps, see what we are working with here. [Canes Country]
*And finally, speaking of the Metro, if you’re making a list of the top-15 forwards in it, is Sean Couturier the only Flyer that makes the list? Hmm. [Pensburgh]</span>

                    <span>Tom Standage, whose The Victorian Internet was hugely influential to me in how to think about the history of technology, is out with a new book on transportation and cars: A Brief History of Motion: From the Wheel, to the Car, to What Comes Next (ebook). In this excerpt, he argues that the world has reached “peak car” — “the point at which car ownership and use level off and start to decline”.
Evidence for peak car in Western countries, meanwhile, has been accumulating for some time. In America, the total number of vehicle miles traveled has continued to increase. But it has been growing more slowly than both the total number of vehicles and the population. The number of miles driven per vehicle, and per person of driving age, both peaked in 2004 and have since fallen to levels last seen i…</span>

                    <span>Within the past 50 years, the global community has solved two huge problems that had the potential to harm every person on Earth. Smallpox once killed 30% of the people who contracted the disease but through the invention of an effective, safe vaccine and an intense effort that began in the 1960s, smallpox was completely eradicated by 1980. In the 1980s, scientists discovered a hole in the ozone layer that protects the Earth from UV radiation; further depletion would have caused major problems with the world’s food supply and an epidemic of skin cancer. Forty years later, we’ve virtually eliminated the chemicals causing the depletion and ozone losses have stabilized and have recently shown improvement.
So how did we do it? The short video above talks through each of challenges, how they were met (science + politics + a bit of luck), and how we might apply these lessons to the big problems of today (climate emergency, the pandemic).

                    <span>This is a lovely, almost poetic piece by Daniel Riley about the sport of freediving and one of the best freedivers in the world, Alexey Molchanov.
Freediving is, after all, a lifelong opportunity to radically reshape one’s body and mind in the process. In pursuing depth, humans must train their lungs and brains to unlock secret sources of clarity and strength and oxygen and potential that are hidden within the body. They are secrets that, once revealed, make the divers not just more effective at their craft, they argue, but more effective, conscious, skillful, and thoughtful as human beings. There is a shift in perspective. A global realignment within one’s consciousness. The look in their eyes when they talk about this thing…every diver who’s gone truly deep sounds like those rarest of in…</span>

                    <span>With iOS 15, Apple introduced a new design and a range of new features, including better support for extensions. Safari in ‌iOS 15‌ supports web extensions, which can be downloaded and installed through the App Store, so there are a much wider range of extension options for you to choose from.





We&#x27;ve rounded up some of the most useful ‌iOS 15‌ extensions that we&#x27;ve found so far.



 
1Password (Subscription Required) - For 1Password users, the 1Password extension allows users to input their saved 1Password information in Safari, similar to how it works on the Mac. 1Password can autofill logins, passwords, credit card information, two-factor authentication codes, and more. A 1Password subscription is required, which is priced at $2.99 per month.

                    <span>Apple is planning to give its Apple Store employees one-time bonuses amounting to up to $1,000, reports Bloomberg. The bonuses will be provided to employees who have been working during the ongoing global health crisis.





Retail employees who were hired before March 31, 2021 will be given $1,000, and employees who joined after that date will be given $500. Employees hired for the holiday shopping season will get $200. Apple plans to provide the bonuses to those who work in retail stores, those who do online sales, and AppleCare staff.



Apple does not often give bonuses to its retail staff. The last bonus went out in 2018 when Apple granted $2,500 in restricted stock units to most of its employees, including those working at Apple Stores. The bonuses were handed out after the introduction of new U.S. tax laws and were given to most employees below a director level.



The $1,000 bonuses will be provided as paychecks rather than as stock units like the prior bonus and are designed as a thank you to employees for their efforts during the pandemic.

                    <span>Microsoft today announced several new additions to its Surface lineup, introducing an updated high-end Surface Laptop and a revised version of its Surface Duo foldable smartphone.






The Surface Laptop Studio is Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;most powerful Surface&quot; to date, and it replaces the Surface Book line of laptops. Rather than a removable display like prior models, Microsoft has adopted a design that looks rather similar to Apple&#x27;s Magic Keyboard. The 14.4-inch display lifts up and can be pulled forward into a tablet mode.





There are actually a total of three modes: laptop, stage, and studio. Laptop looks like a standard laptop computer, while stage is a middle tier mode that allows the display to be pulled forward at an angle for gaming and watching movies, and studio, which is a…</span>

                    <span>Apple today seeded the first public betas of upcoming iOS 15.1 and iPadOS 15.1 betas, one day after seeding the first betas to developers and just a couple days after releasing iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 to the public.





Public beta testers who have signed up for Apple&#x27;s beta testing program can download the iOS and ‌iPadOS 15.1‌ updates over the air after installing the proper certificate from the Public Beta website.



SharePlay makes a return in iOS 15.1, with Apple once again testing the feature that was removed before the launch of iOS 15. SharePlay is designed to let users call their friends and family and interact by watching movies, watching TV, or listening to music together.



Apple has added features like shared playlists and TV show syncing so everyone sees the same thing at the same time. SharePlay also has a built-in screen sharing feature, and Apple is still working out the bugs.



Paired with the HomePod 15.1 beta (which is invite only), iOS 15.1 adds Lossless Audio and Dolby Atmos with Spatial Audio support to the ‌HomePod‌ and the HomePod mini, bringing Apple&#x27;s speakers in line with iPhones, iPads, and Macs.



iPhone users who have a health care provider or state record that uses SMART Health Cards can import their COVID-19 vaccination records into the Health app and can then add a vaccine card to the Wallet app. This is an opt-in feature that uses a global specification, but healthcare providers need to implement it.



Right now, Smart Health Cards are or will be available to those in California, Louisiana, New York, Virginia, Hawaii, and some Maryland counties, as well those who were vaccinated at Walmart, Sam&#x27;s Club, and CVS Health. Healthcare providers like electronic health record vendors like Epic and Cerner also support Smart Health Cards.

                    <span>Apple today seeded a new public beta of the macOS 12 Monterey beta to public beta testers, allowing non-developers to test the new macOS Monterey software ahead of its public release. 





Public beta testers can download the macOS 12 Monterey update from the Software Update section of the System Preferences app after installing the proper profile from Apple&#x27;s beta software website.



‌macOS Monterey‌ introduces quite a few major updates for the macOS operating system. When released, Universal Control will let a single mouse, trackpad, and keyboard be used across multiple Mac or iPad devices, and it&#x27;s now possible to AirPlay directly to a Mac from an iPhone, ‌iPad‌, or even another Mac.

                    <span>Apple has no plans to allow Fortnite to return to the App Store in the near future, Apple&#x27;s lawyers told Epic&#x27;s lawyers this week. Further, Apple does not plan to consider requests for the reinstatement of the Epic Games developer account until the court&#x27;s judgment is &quot;final and nonappealable,&quot; a process that could span years.





Apple provided this information to ‌Epic Games‌ after Epic CEO Tim Sweeney emailed Apple&#x27;s Phil Schiller and asked for the ‌Epic Games‌ developer account to be reinstated. Sweeney said that Epic would adhere to Apple&#x27;s guidelines &quot;whenever and wherever&quot; products were released on Apple&#x27;s platforms, but he went on to explain that Epic would only reinstate Fortnite if Apple adheres to the &quot;plain language of the court order&quot; and allows apps to &quot;include buttons…</span>

Mann said that macro mode, which uses the Ultra Wide lens and allows users to take photos around 2cm away from a subject, is &quot;perhaps the strongest advancement in this year&#x27;s camera system&quot; and fulfills a clear need for many photographers. Images in Macro mode are still able to be fairly sharp in low-light and amid camera shake. Macro effectivel…</span>

                    <span>In addition to the sixth-generation iPad mini, the ninth-generation iPad also saw its review embargo lift today, with reviewers generally feeling that the iterative update hits most of the right notes in terms of prioritizing upgrades to storage, performance, and the front camera.

As an overall take, CNET&#x27;s Scott Stein argues that the &quot;good enough&quot; entry-level ‌iPad‌ actually &quot;covers all the bases best&quot; out of Apple&#x27;s entire ‌iPad‌ lineup at the moment.



Stein notes that iPads are most often secondary devices and especially popular with families, and pricing on the entry-level ‌iPad‌ makes it a compelling product that offers much of the functionality people are looking for in an ‌iPad‌ without breaking the bank.

                    <span>Apple released iOS 15 on Monday, and in the time since, the software update has reportedly seen lower adoption than iOS 14 following its launch last year.





According to analytics company Mixpanel, around 8.5% of users installed iOS 15 as of Wednesday at 12:00 a.m. Eastern Time, compared to around 14.5% for iOS 14 as of midnight on the second day after that software update was released.



Mixpanel measures iOS adoption based on visits to websites and apps that use its mobile analytics SDKs, so the data is not official. Apple has yet to share iOS 15 adoption stats, having last reported an 85% adoption rate for iOS 14 back in June.



Earlier this year, Apple announced that iPhone users who remain on iOS 14 now have the option to continue receiving important security updates, so this change is likely contributing to iOS 15&#x27;s lower adoption rate seen by Mixpanel so far.

Last week, discussions from a private all-hands town hall meeting were leaked to the press, revealing the company&#x27;s stances on issues such as working from home and the Apple vs. Epic legal battle going forwards.



Last night, Cook emailed employees to address the contents of that meeting being leaked, admonishing those who revealed the details of the discussions to the press, but now that email has also been leaked to The Verge. The internal email sent by Cook reads:

                    <span>The sixth-generation iPad mini will begin arriving to customers and launch in stores this Friday, September 24, and ahead of time, reviews of the device have now been shared by several tech websites and YouTube channels.





We&#x27;ve already rounded up video reviews of the new iPad mini, and we&#x27;ve shared some highlights from additional reviews below.









The consensus among reviews is that the new iPad mini is more like an iPad Air mini, as the two devices now share several features, including slimmer bezels, a USB-C port, a Touch ID power button, a 12-megapixel rear Wide camera, and compatibility with the second-generation Apple Pencil. The new iPad mini actually goes a step beyond the iPad Air with Apple&#x27;s latest A15 Bionic chip, 5G on cellular models, and Center Stage s…</span>

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/22/apple-ar-headset-production-second-quarter-2022/">

                    <span>Apple&#x27;s augmented reality headset will enter mass production in the second quarter of next year, with a launch expected between the third and fourth quarter of 2022, according to a translated report from the Taiwanese version of DigiTimes.





In June, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo offered a similar timeline for Apple&#x27;s AR headset, reporting it will launch sometime between April and June of next year. According to today&#x27;s report, Apple&#x27;s AR headset has completed its second phase of prototype testing, inching closer to being ready for primetime mass production.



The first iteration of Apple&#x27;s AR headset may be a bit bulky in design, similar to the Oculus Rift headset, but a sleeker pair of &quot;Apple Glasses&quot; could launch a few years later. In recent years, Apple has been building up its AR platform, rolling out several AR-centric features on iOS and iPadOS, possibly paving the way for the &quot;‌Apple Glasses‌.&quot;



Apple&#x27;s AR headset isn&#x27;t expected to be cheap in price, at least at the start. One report says that it will feature at least 15 camera modules, feature eye-tracking, possibly iris recognition, and could cost between $2,000 and $3,000.

                    <span>Apple opened pre-orders for the iPad mini 6 right after last week&#x27;s &quot;California streaming&quot; event, with first orders arriving this Friday, but anyone who is waiting for the reviews to come in before they order one will likely have a wait on their hands, as estimated delivery times for many variants have since slipped into November in the U.S. and select other countries.





For example, for a 256GB Wi-Fi iPad mini in Pink, Apple&#x27;s website gives a 3-4 week shipping estimate, while estimates lengthen to 4-6 weeks for the same capacity in Starlight or Purple. Most variants are available in 4-6 weeks, with 3-4 weeks being the earliest delivery estimate.



As with every Apple product launch, it is possible that lengthy delivery estimates are a result of low supply rather than high demand. However, the ‌iPad mini‌ was arguably the standout product in Apple&#x27;s event, thanks to its 8.3-inch display and chassis redesign in the vein of the iPad Air. 



The new ‌iPad mini‌ is also the only iPad with Apple&#x27;s latest A15 Bionic chip, and like the iPad Pro, includes a 12-megapixel Ultra Wide front camera enabling Center Stage, so there&#x27;s good reason for ‌iPad mini‌ fans to be excited again.



Review embargos for the ‌iPad mini 6‌ lift later today, so be sure to check back here on MacRumors for a full reviews roundup.

A flood of users has taken to Twitter over the last 24-48 hours to share their experience that after updating to ‌iOS 15‌, they see an &quot;iPhone Storage Almost Full&quot; warning inside of Settings, despite their ‌iPhone‌ having a sufficient amount of storage left.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/safari-macos-turn-off-website-tinting/">
                  <div class="article-summary-box-inner">
                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>In iOS 15 as well as Safari 15 for macOS Big Sur and macOS Catalina, Apple introduced some Safari interface design changes that haven&#x27;t been universally welcomed. Fortunately, Apple has made some of these changes optional, such as the ability to disable tab bar coloring. 




Tab bar coloring on (left) versus coloring off (right) in dark mode


Tab bar coloring, or website tinting, happens when the color of Safari&#x27;s interface changes around the tabs, bookmark, and navigation button areas to match the color of the website you&#x27;re viewing.



The idea behind tinting is that it allows the browser interface to fade into the background and create a more immersive experience. However, the effect doesn&#x27;t always look great, especially if you have several windows arranged on your desktop. Happily, Apple chose to include an option to turn it off.


Launch Safari, then select Safari -&gt; Preferences... from the menu bar.



Select the Tabs panel.


Uncheck the box next to Show color in tab bar.


If you&#x27;re using Safari in ‌iOS 15‌, you can find the same option in Settings -&gt; Safari. Under the &quot;Tabs&quot; section, turn off the switch next to Allow Website Tinting. On iPadOS 15, this option is called Show Color in Tab Bar, just like in Safari 15 for macOS.





In previous versions of iOS, Apple included a &quot;Show Color in Tab Bar&quot; accessibility setting, which basically had the same effect as the new &quot;Allow Website Tinting&quot; toggle. The fact that Apple made the option more prominent suggests user aversion to tinting is more common than previously thought.

                    <span>Born in 1882, Japan’s Seiu Ito was the Father of “Kinbaku” Art, also known as Bondage Art. His imagination conjured things that many of us could not even think of today.

                    <span>Ben Bajarin, writing at Creative Strategies:
While I will admit there is a small percentage of Apple customers
who upgrade every year and a percentage more who upgrade every two
years because they are on upgrade plans, the vast majority of
consumers upgrade every 3-4 years. I thought it would be
interesting to look at some basic iPhone benchmarks through the
years and look at how much performance improvement happens every
four years.
Incremental improvements every year turn into profound improvements over 3–4 years. It’s like the technology version of compound interest. It adds up.
As I benchmarked the A15 Bionic in different ways and pondered how
Apple spends its transistor budget with each A-series chip cycle,
an interesting shift emerged for iPhone 13. Going back to how
Apple spends their transistor budget on features, not necessarily
performance, for the A15, Apple looks to have had the most GPU
gains YoY since the A9. For the past five years, Apple has had an
average of 19% GPU gains YoY but for the A15 Bionic, Apple has
increased GPU performance by 52%.
This intentional increase in GPU performance over CPU performance
speaks to the more graphically intense features Apple had in mind
for iPhone 13 that is demonstrated in things like macro
photography, macro video, and Cinematic Mode. Developers also now
have a dramatically increased GPU at their disposal to create new
app experiences around and can leverage new augmented reality
techniques, visual computing and AI, and more.
It’s almost enough to make one think that Apple is ready to release high-end professional Macs built around Apple GPUs.

                    <span>Jonathan Morrison:
Went hands on with the iPhone 13 Pro and immediately wanted to
test out the camera and cinematic mode. It’s limited to 1080p
30fps but I was surprised to see how sharp it was AND that it
retained Dolby Vision.
Interesting to see Cinematic mode in the hands of a talented videographer. Easily the best “in the wild” Cinematic mode video I’ve seen. (Explicit lyrics in the song.)

                    <span>From Wired’s review of the iPhone 4S:
Apple never specified what the “S” stands for in iPhone 4S, and it
may as well stand for Siri. Sure, the fifth-generation iPhone’s
superb camera and speedy dual-core processor are classy additions.
But Siri is the reason people should buy this phone. […]
The iPhone 4S looks exactly the same as its predecessor — but who
cares? If it was shaped even slightly differently or came in a new
color, people would still go nuts over the stuff that’s more
important anyway: the insides. And both inside and out, this is a
magnificent smartphone.
The late Steve Jobs once called the computer the equivalent of a
bicycle for our minds. I think of the smartphone as the rocket
ship for our minds. With increasingly powerful sensors and
technologies, and access to hundreds of thousands of apps enabling
us to do just about anything, the iPhone keeps soaring to
incredible heights and taking us to places with limitless
potential. I guess that’s what you have to do to create a ding in
the universe.
I don’t know what happened to the fellow who wrote this review 10 years ago, but The New York Times could sure use a personal tech critic with this sort of enthusiasm and insight into the way that incremental improvements aggregate in just a few years in profound ways.

                    <span>Horace Dediu, writing at Asymco:
There are more than 1 billion iPhone users. The total number of
users has been rising steadily. iPhone users make up about 26% of
all smartphone users (3.8 billion is the current estimate). The
share of users in the US is about 60% (or soon will be.) The share
in UK is close to 50%. All these share numbers are higher than
ever. Over 14% of US and 10% of UK survey respondents have
switched to an iPhone in the past two years.
I was not aware that churn was so strongly in the favor of iPhone over the last two years. Pretty good for a phone that Henry Blodget declared “dead in the water” in 2012. The downside to this trend, if it continues, is Apple might start running into being deemed an actual monopolist — by which I mean holding a monopoly share of phones p…</span>

The NYT does not believe regular people stand to benefit from
better iPhone photos in the dark. I live for this review from
another planet every year.
I thought this was a really strange passage too. Quoting from Chen’s review:
So in summary, the iPhone 13 cameras are slightly better than
those of last year’s iPhones. Even compared with iPhones from
three years ago, the cameras are much better only if you care
about taking nice photos in the dark.
Just how important is night photography? I posed the question to
Jim Wilson, a longtime staff photographer for The New York Times,
as he was taking pictures of the new iPhones for this review. He

How did York’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
York had, really by all counts, a pretty stellar season. Despite a disappointing end to their season, which saw them removed from the NCAA tournament due to COVID protocols, the University of Michigan had a very strong 2020-21 season, and York was a key piece to their success. He w…</span>

How did Allison’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
After making us wait through four college seasons — and a couple big injury scares — Wade Allison burst onto the professional scene in 2020-21 with production at both the AHL and NHL level.

The Flyers have already caught the injury bug before the season begins.
 The Philadelphia Flyers are not starting their season with the best footing. After a summer full of transition and the result being the most shaken-up roster amidst the 32 NHL squads, they announced on Tuesday that they will be dropping the puck on Oct. 15 against the Vancouver Canucks without center Kevin Hayes, as well as depth blueliner Sam Morin, and roster hopeful Wade Allison.
All three of them will be away from the lineup for a significant amount of time – Allison being labelled as “out indefinitely – but the Flyers are purely hoping that the roster that GM Chuck Fletcher spent so much time on during the last few months tinkering with, can be able to withstan…</span>

How did Foerster’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
Similarly to Zayde Wisdom, Foerster was called up to the AHL due to the uncertainty of the OHL season, and equally, Foerster impressed. His goal total of ten ranked him second among Phantoms skaters, and to play so well at only 18 in a professional league speaks volumes for Foerster’s potential.

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *The Flyers dropped a bunch of information about training camp yesterday — training camp starts in less that one week — and also dropped a little nugget about Kevin Hayes requiring a rather major surgery! Oh good! [BSH]
*It’s an abdominal surgery which is going to keep him out for a rather long time. [NBC Sports Philly]
*No two ways about it: this really stinks! [Inquirer]
*It certainly will make training camp more interesting, as this is a rather large gaping hole the Flyers need to fill for the opening night lineup. [The Athletic]
*Hayes is just one on a very long list of pretty notable names that will miss the start of this season due to injury. What the heck is going on here?! [ProHockeyTalk]
*Anyway, in a bit of good news, Oskar Lindblom is full-throttle ready to get back on the ice and back to the player he was before his cancer diagnosis. [Inquirer]
*We’ve cracked the top-10 in the 25 Under 25, and the guy to do it was Bobby Brink. [BSH]
*At number 9, a guy we’d all like to see crack the lineup this season, at least for a little bit. [BSH]
*Related, let’s take a look around the Metro Division and see what the center situation for each team looks like. [Canes Country]
*And finally, remember when Ron Hextall traded Zac Rinaldo for a third round pick? In hindsight, the greatest move of his general management career. [ProHockeyTalk]</span>

Here’s a rough idea of when Festival of the Lost, The Dawning, Bungie’s 30th Anniversary Event, and Moments of Triumph will appear in Destiny 2
 After four weeks of Destiny 2’s Season of the Lost, Bungie finally launched the calendar and roadmap for the game’s current season. But unlike previous schedules, which listed out the exact dates for events and quests, Season of the Lost’s calendar roadmap is surprisingly sparse. 
Season of the Lost is already in a unique position. Due to The Witch Queen’s delay earlier this year, Season of the Lost will run from August of this year to Feb. 22, 2022. That’s a six month season, where seasons like Splicer and Chosen traditionally last for only three. With the long season, Bungie has a lot of seasonal events to cram into Season…</span>

Apple could keep Fortnite off Mac and iOS for five years
 Following a ruling in Fortnite creator Epic Games’ lawsuit against Apple, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney says Apple will blacklist Fortnite from its ecosystem until its appeals process makes the judgment final.
“Apple lied,” Sweeney said on Twitter. “Apple spent a year telling the world, the court, and the press they’d ‘welcome Epic’s return to the App Store if they agree to play by the same rules as everyone else.’ Epic agreed, and now Apple has reneged in another abuse of its monopoly power over a billion users.”
Sweeney said that Apple’s decision could keep Fortnite off iOS and Mac platforms for as long as five years as the appeals process plays out.

Two kits and a large number of item variants
 The Sims 4’s Dream Home Decorator game pack did a lot for players interested in home renovation and design, but a new base game update published Tuesday is, arguably, a much bigger deal.
Developer Maxis added two new kits to The Sims 4: Fashion Street and Incheon Arrivals, inspired by India and South Korea, respectively. Most of the stuff in these kits is available only if players buy them, but Maxis added a new, free base game update, too. And it’s an update that’s been a long time coming — expert Sims builders have been asking for this level of customization for some time now. The Sims 4 art team added around 1,200 new item variants to 149 base game items in Build Mode, publisher Electronic Arts said in an update on The Sims 4 website. To put it simply, 149 items now have a massive selection of different color and pattern swatches, which means that you can make things match in new ways. Curtains! Wood swatches that match! Colorful stoves!
The full list of items is available on The Sims 4 blog. In particular, I’m getting real Ironwood Kitchenette vibes from the new VAULT Modular kitchen set.

It’s not only inside stuff, either: There are new swatches for gardening, as well as plants themselves, plus all 64 base game windows have been updated, too. It’s overwhelming and very exciting — there’s so much room for deeper customization with these additional swatches. Of course, it’s no Create a Style, which let The Sims 3 players fully customize object patterns and colors.
Still, it’s a step closer.</span>

It’s called Threads of Light
 Fashion is power in Destiny 2, but players are interested in more than just pure stats. Sure, players want armor and other gear that’ll make their characters more powerful — but plenty of players place equal importance on just how dang good they look. Since Destiny, fashionable players have been convening in the /r/DestinyFashion subreddit, where players share their best looks and how they acquired them — a process that sometimes means a major grind.
Destiny 2 developer Bungie has clearly noticed the appeal of a stylish guardian, and to honor that, it’s creating a digital fashion magazine featuring looks from the game. Called Threads of Light, the magazine is for “celebrating [the] community’s creativity and showcasing the best guardian …</span>

Eidos-Montreal’s adventure shines when the bickering misfits huddle up and rally
 The action in Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy isn’t necessarily squad-based or team tactics combat, but there is an order of battle the player must follow, especially for the big set-piece battles. Keep this in mind if you pick up Eidos-Montreal’s take on Marvel’s adventure-dramedy at the end of October: Have a plan, and make choices to advance it. You’re not going to get out of a throwdown simply by telling Rocket to blow everything up.
This is because the Guardians all deal two types of damage: regul…</span>

It’s not been for lack of trying, several false starts to this entry to the the archives of Black, Raw, and Bleeding occurred along the way. Yet ...</span>

                    <span>Every year for the past several years on September 21, Demi Adejuyigbe makes a video featuring the 1978 Earth, Wind &amp; Fire song September (which begins “Do you remember, twenty-first night of September?”) This year, for what he says is his final effort, Adejuyigbe made a whole-ass movie, complete with special effects. Gonna watch this later with my daughter, who is 12 today (and owns the t-shirt).
In tandem with the video, Adejuyigbe is raising money to benefit The West Fund (a pro-choice Texas organization), Imagine Water Works (a New Orleans organization focused on Hurricane Ida relief efforts), and The Sunrise Movement (a climate emergency advocacy group) — you can donate here.

                    <span>For the next two weeks, L’Arc de Triomphe in Paris will be wrapped, an installation that realizes a project begun by the late husband and wife team Christo and Jeanne-Claude in 1961.
L’Arc de Triomphe, Wrapped, a temporary artwork for Paris, is on view for 16 days from Saturday, September 18 to Sunday, October 3, 2021. The project has been realized in partnership with the Centre des Monuments Nationaux and in coordination with the City of Paris. It also receives the support of the Centre Pompidou. The Arc de Triomphe is wrapped in 25,000 square meters of recyclable polypropylene fabric in silvery blue, and with 3,000 meters of red rope.
In 1961, three years after they met in Paris, Christo and Jeanne-Claude began creating works of art in public spaces. One of their projects was to wrap a public building. When he arrived in Paris, Christo rented a small room near the Arc de Triomphe and had been attracted by the monument ever since. In 1962, he made a photomontage of the Arc de Triomphe wrapped, seen from the Avenue Foch and, in 1988, a collage. 60 years later, the project will finally be concretized.


Jeanne-Claude died in 2009 and Christo followed in 2020, so the project was completed by their team according to their wishes. I would have liked to have seen this in person…The Gates in NYC were wonderful.

                    <span>Welp, from the small glimpses we get in this trailer, Joel Coen’s The Tragedy of Macbeth, starring Denzel Washington and Frances McDormand, looks pretty fantastic. Out in theaters on Dec 25, streaming on Apple+ Jan 14.

                    <span>The full moon was wonderful last night and Andrew McCarthy captured this colorful image of our nearest celestial companion. McCarthy explained where all those colors come from:
Back to this image, this was captured through a telescope and involved capturing thousands of frames to reveal the details. But what about the colors? The moon is gray, of course, but not *perfectly* gray. Some areas have a subtle blue tint, and others have a more orange tint. By teasing out those subtle colors, I can reveal the mineral composition of the moon! Blues denote titanium presence, while orange shows iron and feldspar present in the regolith. You can also see how impacts paint the surface with fresh color in the ejecta as they churn up material.


A print is available, but only for a very limited time (~6 more hours as of pub time).

                    <span>There are multiple features that Apple wasn&#x27;t able to get ready for launch prior to the debut of iOS and iPadOS 15, which is not unusual. There are usually some iOS features that take a little more time to prepare for primetime, and Apple releases these features in iOS updates.





Below, we&#x27;ve rounded up iOS 15 additions that weren&#x27;t ready when iOS 15 launched and will be implemented in ‌iOS 15‌ updates coming later this year and next year.



SharePlay


A FaceTime feature, SharePlay was available for most of the beta testing period, but it was buggy and in August, Apple confirmed that it wouldn&#x27;t be implemented when ‌iOS 15‌ launched.





SharePlay is a way for users to do more on FaceTime calls with friends and family, offering options for watching TV together, list…</span>

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/21/genesis-digital-car-keys-code/">

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Last year, Apple debuted support for digital car keys, which let users lock, unlock, and start their vehicles using a pass stored in the Wallet app on the iPhone. And with iOS 15, there&#x27;s now Ultra Wideband support on the iPhone 11 and later that will let the feature work without having to remove your ‌iPhone‌ from your pocket.





Car manufacturers need to add the NFC technology to their vehicles to support digital car keys, and so far BMW has been the only manufacturer to do so with Apple&#x27;s platforms.



It appears as if that&#x27;s about to change, however, as an Apple configuration file specifying various compatibility criteria for Apple Pay NFC functionality has been updated today to add mention of Hyundai&#x27;s luxury brand Genesis.





We noted earlier this year that BMW was preparing to support the Ultra Wideband version of Apple&#x27;s digital car key feature and that Hyundai was reportedly moving to adopt digital car keys on ‌iPhone‌ as well, and that now appears to be coming to fruition.



We&#x27;ve yet to see an official announcement from Hyundai or Genesis about launching digital car key support on iOS, but the manufacturer debuted the feature on Android with its 2021 GV80 and G80 models and indicated that it was working with Apple on iOS support.

                    <span>With iOS 15, Apple expanded the Do Not Disturb feature from iOS 14 into a full Focus Mode option that&#x27;s designed to allow users to set up different scenarios to manage their incoming notifications.





Focus Mode is handy because it lets you decide exactly what alerts and apps you want to see at home, while at work, when sleeping, when exercising, and in other situations, but as Reddit users have pointed out, Apple has dropped a key Do Not Disturb feature.



Do Not Disturb in ‌iOS 14‌ had a setting that allowed incoming calls and notifications to be silenced at all times, or only when the iPhone was locked. With this setting, you could turn on Do Not Disturb but still get all of your calls and notifications if you unlocked your phone and were actively using it.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(9 min)</span>
                    <span>Alongside the iOS 15.1 beta, Apple has also introduced a HomePod 15.1 beta that brings Lossless and Dolby Atmos Spatial Audio support to the ‌HomePod‌ and the HomePod mini.





The ‌HomePod‌ beta software is invite only and is not provided to developers for testing purposes, but 9to5Mac was able to confirm that Lossless and Spatial Audio support are included in the beta.



Apple added Dolby Atmos with Spatial Audio and Lossless support to iOS and Mac devices in May, but promised that the feature would be coming to the ‌HomePod‌ and ‌HomePod mini‌ at a later time.



Lossless Audio and Dolby Atmos can be enabled through the Home app. Open up Home Settings, tap on your profile, and then under Media, tap on Apple Music. From there, toggle on Lossless Audio and Dolby Atmos. Note that these options appear in the iOS 15.1 beta, but the ‌HomePod‌ 15.1 beta seems to be needed to actually use the features on the ‌HomePod‌.



If all goes well, these features should launch with the ‌HomePod‌ 15.1 software that is set to be released alongside iOS 15.1. Since the iOS 15.1 was just provided to developers today, we likely have several weeks of testing to go.

                    <span>Just a day after releasing the iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 updates, Apple has already seeded the first betas of iOS 15.1 and iPadOS 15.1. The new updates reintroduce features like SharePlay, and below, we have a list of what&#x27;s new.





SharePlay


SharePlay is enabled in the iOS 15.1, iPadOS 15.1, and tvOS 15.1 betas to allow Apple to further work out bugs to get the feature ready to launch. Apple decided to pull SharePlay from the ‌iOS 15‌ launch because it was not properly functioning and was still riddled with issues.





Available in FaceTime, SharePlay is designed to let users call up their friends and family and then watch TV, watch movies, and listen to music together using neat features like shared playlists and TV show syncing for all users. SharePlay also allows for screen sharing.



If testing goes well, SharePlay could see an official launch in iOS 15.1.



Announce Calls


In the Settings for the Phone app, there&#x27;s a new icon for the &quot;Announce Calls&quot; setting.





Lossless Audio for HomePod


The HomePod 15.1 beta that accompanies the iOS 15.1 beta adds Lossless Audio and Dolby Atmos with Spatial Audio support to the HomePod and HomePod mini.



Vaccine Cards in Wallet


In ‌iOS 15‌, verifiable health records can be downloaded and stored in the Health app, and this includes COVID-19 vaccination records and health results. In iOS 15.1, vaccination records are able to be added to the Wallet app so a vaccine card can be provided to businesses, restaurants, venues, and more where vaccines are required for entry.



See our previous article for more details and discussion. Discussion should be limited to the ‌iOS 15‌ update and political comments will be immediately removed.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/21/ios-15-vaccine-card-wallet-app/">

                    <span>The iOS 15.1 beta that was introduced today allows iPhone users to upload their COVID-19 vaccination status to the Health app and then generate a vaccination card in Apple Wallet.





The Apple Wallet vaccination card can be shown to businesses, venues, restaurants, and more that are requiring vaccines for entry.



As outlined in an announcement to developers, verifiable health records are based on the SMART Health Cards specification. California is using SMART Health Cards, so users in California can add their vaccination records to the Wallet app after installing iOS 15.1.



Other states and health organizations that use the SMART Health Cards will be able to use a button to let users know that they can download and store their vaccination information in the Health app and in the Wallet app. 



California, Louisiana, New York, Virginia, Hawaii, and some Maryland counties support Smart Health Cards, as do Walmart, Sam&#x27;s Club, and CVS Health. So those in the specific supported states should be able to look up their information in state databases, but those who were vaccinated through companies like Walmart and CVS will also be able to add their information to the Health and Wallet apps because it&#x27;s the same system. 



Note that some apps like the one used by the NHS in the UK allowed users to add their vaccination records to the Wallet app, but the new solution is a universal standard that will work for all healthcare providers/states that implement it. 



Discussion should be limited to the app and implementation, and not politics.

                    <span>Today we&#x27;re tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air.

Apple Pencil 2


Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn&#x27;t the lowest price we&#x27;ve ever tracked on this accessory, as it&#x27;s been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it&#x27;s still a solid second-best deal if you&#x27;re looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week.

                    <span>The new betas of iOS 15.1, iPadOS 15.1, and tvOS 15.1 reintroduce SharePlay, the feature that Apple pulled from the iOS 15.0 updates because it was not yet ready to be released.





Testing SharePlay no longer requires the SharePlay Development Profile to get it to work, but those who want to use it on macOS Monterey will still need to use the SharePlay profile and will need to update to the newly released ‌macOS Monterey‌ beta.





SharePlay is a FaceTime feature that&#x27;s designed to allow users to watch movies and listen to music with their friends and family on ‌FaceTime‌ calls, and it also has a screensharing component.



SharePlay was functional for the early part of iOS 15 testing prior to ‌iOS 15‌&#x27;s release, but Apple ended up pulling it because it was buggy and there wasn&#x27;t time to get it ready for release. Apple said it would be released in a future update.

Registered developers can download the beta through the Apple Developer Center and once the appropriate profile is installed, betas will be available through the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences.



As with all new betas, Apple recommends not installing the new macOS update on a primary machine because it is early release software and could have bugs.

iOS 15.1 can be downloaded through the Apple Developer Center or over the air after the proper profile has been installed on an iPhone or iPad. 



There&#x27;s no word yet on what&#x27;s included in the update, but there are a number of features in ‌iOS 15‌ that have yet to be released, such as SharePlay, so we could see these introduced in the new software for testing purposes.

                    <span>Apple today seeded the first beta of an upcoming watchOS 8.1 beta to developers for testing purposes, with the update coming just a day after watchOS 8 was released to the public.





To install ‌‌‌watchOS 8‌‌‌, developers will need to download the configuration profile from the Apple Developer Center. Once installed, ‌‌‌watchOS 8‌‌‌ can be downloaded through the dedicated Apple Watch app on the iPhone by going to General &gt; Software update.



To update to new software, an Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery life, it must be placed on the charger, and it needs to be in range of the ‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌. It&#x27;s not recommended to install ‌‌‌watchOS 8‌‌‌ on a main Apple Watch as the software may be unstable at this early date.



There&#x27;s no word yet on what&#x27;s new in watchOS 8.1, but we&#x27;ll update this article when we know more.

Developers can download the new tvOS 15 beta by downloading a profile onto the ‌Apple TV‌ using Xcode.



Other than new releases, tvOS updates are often minor in scale, focusing on under-the-hood bug fixes and improvements rather than major outward-facing changes. There&#x27;s no word yet on what&#x27;s included in tvOS 15.1 update, but we&#x27;ll update this article should anything new be found.

                    <span>iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max reviews were published today, with the devices receiving praise for their smoother ProMotion displays, longer battery life, and improved cameras, but there was one consistent complaint among the reviews.





On the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max, a new feature is the ability to take macro photos. As noted by Input Mag&#x27;s Raymond Wong, however, this new capability results in the device automatically switching from the Wide lens to the Ultra Wide lens when you place an object or a subject within 5.5 inches of the rear camera. (The viewfinder still shows &quot;1x&quot; framing, but the camera relies on the Ultra Wide lens for autofocus.)



The automatic camera switching is easily noticeable in the iPhone&#x27;s viewfinder, as Wong demonstrated in the video…</span>

                    <span>Apple has begun selling iPhones on its Certified Refurbished online store in Canada, offering residents in the country a more affordable way to purchase iPhones from Apple online.





Apple has been selling different refurbished iPhone models in the United States online since 2016. While Apple has long offered iPads and Macs in its Canadian refurbished store, this is the first time customers in the country have been able to benefit from the discounts that come with buying an Apple refurbished smartphone. 



Previously, customers in Canada who wanted lower prices on iPhones had to wait for third-party deals or purchase refurbished/used devices from a third-party retailer, but with Apple&#x27;s highly regarded refurbishment process now an option for iPhones too, this should come as a welcome development.



All of Apple&#x27;s refurbished products, ‌iPhone‌ included, are tested, certified, cleaned, and guaranteed with a one-year warranty. iPhones also feature a brand new battery and a fresh outer shell, ensuring there are no scratches or other cosmetic damage.



Customers in Canada can currently choose from a variety of refurbished recent ‌iPhone‌ models in various finishes and capacities, including ‌iPhone‌ XS, XS Max, 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max, with up to CAD$560 off the regular price currently on offer. With the iPhone 13 lineup about to drop into consumers&#x27; hands, expect iPhone 12 models to be included in Apple&#x27;s refurbished listings soon.



(Thanks, Anthony!)

According to the report, which echoes previously announced research efforts, Apple wants to be able to use the camera inside of the ‌iPhone‌ to track a child&#x27;s face and observe different facial behaviors, such as how often they look away, as potential factors for detecting childhood autism. From the report:

                    <span>Apple today launched a new offer that provides owners of the second-generation AirPods, AirPods Pro, AirPods Max, and select Beats products with a six-month free subscription to Apple Music.





The offer is only valid for new ‌Apple Music‌ subscribers, and no new purchase is required, so this is open to any users who currently own an eligible product. Eligible products include the second-generation ‌AirPods‌ (with wired or wireless case), ‌AirPods Pro‌, ‌AirPods Max‌, Beats Studio Buds, Powerbeats, Powerbeats Pro, and Beats Solo Pro. Eligible users will see a prompt in the ‌Apple Music‌ app for their six-month free offer.



The offer must be claimed within 90 days from when users first connect their eligible ‌AirPods‌ or Beats product to an Apple device after September 20 to take up the offer.



Apple emphasizes that customers must be on the latest iOS and iPadOS versions to see the offer, which as of yesterday, is iOS and iPadOS 15. The new offer is a notable package from Apple, as it&#x27;s not often the company has bundled the purchase of its ‌AirPods‌ or Beats products with its ‌Apple Music‌ service.



More information about the offer can be found on Apple&#x27;s website.



Update: This article has been updated to clarify that no new purchase of an ‌AirPods‌ or Beats product is required. Customers who previously purchased an eligible product are also able to take advantage of the offer.

                    <span>Brian X. Chen’s review of the new iPhones for The New York Times is the least enthusiastic I’ve seen:
This is all to say the annual phone upgrade, which companies like
Apple and Samsung tout with enormous marketing events and ad
campaigns to gin up sales for the holiday shopping season, has
become a mirage of tech innovation. In reality, the upgrades are
now a celebration of
capitalism
in the form of ruthless incrementalism.
Fair enough, but I found it curious that Chen’s review didn’t contain the word “battery”. The consensus is pretty strong that the two standout features are better cameras and improved battery life.

                    <span>Joanna Stern, reviewing the iPhone 13 lineup for the WSJ:
With videos, gosh, I was really excited about the new Cinematic
mode. Aaaand gosh, was it a let down. The feature — which you
could call “Portrait mode for video” — adds artistic blur
around the object in focus. The coolest thing is that you can
tap to refocus while you shoot (and even do it afterward in the
Photos app).
Except, as you can see in my video, the software struggles to know
where objects begin and end. It’s a lot like the early days of
Portrait Mode, but it’s worse because now the blur moves and
warps. I shot footage where the software lost parts of noses and
fingers, and struggled with items such as a phone or camera. The
Apple spokeswoman said Cinematic mode is a “breakthrough
innovation that will keep getting better over time.”
Stern went all-in on Cinematic mode for the video accompanying her review.

                    <span>Raymond Wong shot a bunch of great camera comparison for his Input review. He was annoyed by the same jarring automatic switch between the 1× to 0.5× lens when entering or leaving macro mode that I mentioned in my review:
I welcome greater detail for close-ups and it’s clever that Apple
is using the ultra-wide to augment the 1× wide and 3× telephoto at
short distances, but the transitioning of cameras is disorienting.
Apple makes no mention of this camera switching/augmenting on its
iPhone 13 Pro website. I get that it’s supposed to be one of those
“it just works” features. At least that was Apple’s intention I’m
told, but it just doesn’t.
Here’s a screen recording of the automatic camera switching in
action. In this shot, I was trying to frame these delicious soup
dumplings using the grid. Holding the iPhone 13 Pro still, you can
see the 1× wide switching to another slightly different FOV that’s
using the ultra-wide autofocusing. The viewfinder keeps jittering
as it tries to choose between a regular wide or wide-macro shot. A
regular person wouldn’t look at this and think to themselves, this
is normal. They’d look at the jittering and think something is
broken with their iPhone camera. The framing should never change
from what you compose and never automatically.
Wong’s screen recording illustrates the issue perfectly.
When I first pressed Apple and made them aware of the jarring
camera switching, I was told it’s how the camera system works. On
the eve of this review, Apple changed course and said it’s going
to release a software update to let users disable the camera
switching. According to Apple:
A new setting will be added in a software update this fall to turn
off automatic camera switching when shooting at close distances
for macro photography and video.

                    <span>Matthew Panzarino, writing for TechCrunch, regarding Cinematic video mode:
I did some test shooting with my kids walking through crowds and
riding on carousels that was genuinely, shockingly good. It really
does provide a filmic, dreamy quality to the video that I was
previously only able to get with quick and continuous focus
adjustments on an SLR shooting video with a manually focused lens.
That, I think, is the major key to understanding Cinematic Mode.
Despite the marketing, this mode is intended to unlock new
creative possibilities for the vast majority of iPhone users who
have no idea how to set focal distances, bend their knees to
stabilize and crouch-walk-rack-focus their way to these kinds of
tracking shots. It really does open up a big bucket that was just
inaccessible before. And in many cases I think that those willing
to experiment and deal with its near-term foibles will be
rewarded with some great looking shots to add to their iPhone
memories widget.
That sounds right to me.

                    <span>Dieter Bohn, writing for The Verge:
Apple’s marketing for the camera system on the 13 Pro is that it’s
the “biggest advancement ever.” I don’t know that I would go that
far, but I also can’t remember the last time I’ve said “whoa, look
at this photo” as many times as I have during this review. […]
Where the Pro 13 camera system shines is in low light. The main
wide-angle sensor has seen a massive upgrade this year. Unlike
Android phones that are chasing big megapixel counts and then
“pixel binning” to achieve low light performance, Apple is
sticking with 12 megapixels, the same resolution it’s used since
2015’s iPhone 6S. The sensor itself is much bigger now and
features 1.9 µm pixels, which are about as big as anything we’ve
seen on a smartphone. And on top of all that, the lens now has an
ƒ/1.5 aperture.
All of that adds up to a camera that can very quickly take in a
massive amount of light relative to other phones. Combined with
some tuning and improvements to Apple’s computational photography,
the low light performance on the 13 Pro is simply second to none.
I came away super impressed with the low light performance of the 13 Pro, too.
Bohn makes an important point in his corresponding review of the 13 and 13 Mini too: because the camera bumps are all new sizes, cases for the iPhone 13 won’t fit the 13 Pro, nor vice-versa.

                    <span>Apple Newsroom, back on August 30:
Primephonic is no longer available for new subscribers and will be
taken offline beginning September 7. Apple Music plans to launch a
dedicated classical music app next year combining Primephonic’s
classical user interface that fans have grown to love with more
added features. In the meantime, current Primephonic subscribers
will receive six months of Apple Music for free, providing access
to hundreds of thousands of classical albums, all in Lossless and
high-resolution audio, as well as hundreds of classical albums in
Apple Music’s Spatial Audio, with new albums added regularly.
I’ve had this flagged for a few weeks. What I find interesting is Apple is going to use this acquisition to launch a dedicated classical music app, not to expand the Music app. iTunes, infamously, expanded greatly over the years, and everyone seems to agree that the user experience suffered for it. I wonder if that’s in the back of Apple’s mind here.

Suddenly, everything is happening. 
 Just like that, training camp is upon us! The Flyers are set to be back on the ice starting on Thursday. We’ll see them broken up into three groups for regular on-ice sessions for the first three days of camp, and then they’ll add a couple of scrimmages on top of those sessions on Sunday and Monday, ahead of Tuesday’s preseason kickoff against the Islanders. 
You can find the full schedule for here, and the full roster for camp can be found here. 
The Flyers have also announced the following injury updates:
Kevin Hayes (abdominal surgery on 9/21 - out 6-8 weeks)
Samuel Morin (right knee surgery to have loose bodies removed on 9/10 - out 6-8 weeks)
Wade Allison (right ankle sprain - out indefinitely)
Zayde Wisdom (shoulder surgery - out indefinitely)
Cooper Zech (upper body - out 6-8 weeks)
Not all of this is surprising: we knew that Wisdom would be out for a while, and there had been rumors about Morin’s status kicking around for the last little bit here. But there are a few takeaways. The ankle injury for Allison is still not great, but considering how ugly the play he was injured on looked, and the knee issues he’s had in the past, an ankle injury feels like a bit of a bullet dodged, all things considered. 
The Hayes news is the big surprise, and that certainly complicates things. The Flyers’ center situation heading into camp already looked to be a bit up in the air, and a lot was going to depend on those battles in camp to solidify those positions, and now they seem to be even more wide open. With Hayes out (and to a degree, Allison as well) this certainly opens up the door for some prospects like Morgan Frost and Tanner Laczynski, who have been impressing in development and rookie camps, to push hard for a spot, and reasonably grab one. 
Things are getting really interesting around here, and while it feels like we say this every year, this camp is going to be one to keep an eye on.</span>

A toolsy defender with size and upside, and just 21 years old.
 No. 9: Egor Zamula
2020-21 League/Team(s): Flyers/Phantoms
2020-21 Statistics: 0 G, 6 A, 6 P in 25 G
Age: 21
Acquired In: 2018 (signed as an undrafted free agent)
Ranking in Spring 2020 25 Under 25: 13
How did Zamula’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
Zamula logged 25 games in his professional debut with the Phantoms in Lehigh Valley and then two games with the Flyers later in the season as they were eliminated from Stanley Cup playoff contention. In those games, Zamula went scoreless in the NHL, but he registered six assists in 25 AHL contests to put a bow on a very strange season — but one in which …</span>

Breaking into the top 10!
 No. 10: Bobby Brink
2020-21 League/Team(s): University of Denver (NCHC, NCAA)
2020-21 Statistics: 2 G, 9 A, 11 P in 15 GP
Age: 20
Acquired In: 2019 (drafted)
Ranking in Spring 2020 25 Under 25: 14th
How did Brink’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
It was a weird season for everyone in some regard, but it was a particularly weird season for Brink. For starters, he really didn’t play that much—with being away for the World Juniors pre-tournament camp and the tournament itself, he only played 15 games for Denver, and then those seven World Junior games for the US. But, limited as his play might have been, it wasn’t a poor season. Denver struggled quite a bit…</span>

They’re both time loop murder mystery mashups 
 As I wrapped up my current Deathloop playthrough, I was intensely reminded of a book I had just finished — Stuart Turton’s 2018 murder mystery best-seller The 7½ Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle. If you liked one, you just might like the other.
Though I’m not the first to make this comparison, I found the two echoed one another so closely because they mash up genres in an eerily similar way. Deathloop and The 7½ Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle both combine time loops with murder mysteries — genres that are similarly dense with detail and encourage clue-finding. Plus, each category is enduringly popular on its own. Time loops are a science-fiction trope that’s littered across film, with Grou…</span>

Arkane’s latest hotfix should make the PC frame rate a little smoother
 Deathloop is getting praise from just about everyone who plays it, but the PC version has a few problems. The worst of these is a camera stutter that happens just about every time players move their mouse. It’s an extremely frustrating issue, but one that Arkane hopes to have fixed with a new patch released on Tuesday. 
According to the patch notes that Arkane released with the new update, Tuesday’s hotfix aims to address issues that PC players have had where “mouse-based camera movements could result in the appearance of ‘stutter.’” That’s a lot of qualifiers to parse, but it seems like Arkane is saying that these aren’t actually frame rate stutters, they just have the “appearance” of them. Whatever the problem was, hopefully this patch makes it feel a little better.
While the camera problem might be solved, it isn’t the only problem with Deathloop’s PC port. Arkane also explains in the patch notes that it’s looking into other problems as well. For instance, when you play Deathloop at an extremely high frame rate, the game also encounters a stutter. In our experience the game became nearly unplayable at 240 fps thanks to this issue, but it was fine when locked at 140 fps. In Tuesday’s patch notes, Arkane said that it thinks it’s identified the problem and will update players when it has more information. 
Even if there are still a few problems, the good news is Arkane seems to be working on them and trying to make the PC port as smooth as possible for players.</span>

A great game with a multiplayer add-on that’s just okay
 Deathloop is a fantastic game, but there’s one element that’s just kind of there — the player versus player combat. 
Every time I start Deathloop, I’m given an option. I can either try to break the loop as Colt, or protect it as Julianna. This is an intriguing premise. While the game’s other antagonists are all locked into the same routines and schedules, Julianna is free of the cycle; she’s controlled by a human player I cannot predict and sometimes cannot outplay. But the execution of this executioner is just so-so, and it stands out like a useless appendage in an otherwise spectacular experience.
When playing as Colt, you can toggle the possibility of Julianna invasions on and off.…</span>

The game is still best played in multiplayer
 MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries is still a bit of a mess, even with the new Legend of the Kestrel Lancers expansion. The new DLC succeeds in eliminating the early-game grind, mainly by throwing in-game money at the problem. But nothing seems able to stop the overwhelming stupidity of its friendly AI.
Kestrel Lancers kicks off with a series of wargames which, fitting nicely with the overall lore of the BattleTech universe, are actually live-fire field exercises. Damage coverage — cash that you use to repair your Mechs after a battle — is upped to 10 million credits, an order of magnitude more than the compensation meted out in the base game’s early missions. This allowed me to use my arsenal of big stompy robots for some…</span>

The developers talk about her design and modernizing her for release
 Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is on the way, and with it, the antics of a silly cast of Nickelodeon characters duking it out in the fighting arena. Developed by Ludosity and Fair Play Labs, Nickelodeon’s spin on a Super Smash Bros.-style fighting game will feature familiar faces like SpongeBob SquarePants and Patrick Star, along with some of Nicktoon’s most popular characters. And with the introduction of so many unconventional fighters comes the opportunity for new ones to enter the fighting arena, including April O’Neil, a star of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

You’ve played this game before
 I’m in the midst of another forest meadow. It would be picturesque if not for all the gnarled purple roots strangling the life out of the place, and the fleshy bulbs pulsating a toxic red. As Kena, a spirit guide who travels the land seeking to reunite the dead, usher spirits to the afterlife, and generally put things right, my top priorities are the forested valley and its health. For the most part, this means eliminating all those red nodules that blight the land.
For what’s ostensibly an indie game made by an animation studio crossing over to the realm of video games for the first time, Kena: Bridge of Spirits is a surprisingly slick affair. Movement is swift, platforming is non-aggravating, and the third-person combat is dancel…</span>

                    <span>In Living While Black, in Japan, directed by Keith Bedford and Shiho Fukada, a group of African-Americans talk about what it’s like to live in Japan as Black people versus their experiences living in the United States.
“I didn’t leave because I was running away from anything. I left because I felt I could be more myself in Japan.”
“Living in Japan, as an African-American, I’ve honestly never felt more free.”
“You know, I can do things here in Japan that I can’t do back at home, in the U.S.”
“I can catch a cab when I’m not trying to catch a cab. People in stores that are supposed to serve you, serve you, like they serve everybody else.”

                    <span>If you’re talking about the origins of rock &amp; roll, Sister Rosetta Tharpe has to be included in those conversations. Her early fusion of gospel, the blues, and the electric guitar (as on 1944’s Strange Things Happening Every Day, a contender for the first rock &amp; roll record) had a huge influence on men like Little Richard, Chuck Berry, and Elvis Presley, who ended up winning much of the credit for this innovation. This 60-minute BBC documentary from 2011 is a good place to start learning about Tharpe — part 1 is embedded above and here are parts two, three, and four.
I found this via Ted Mills at Open Culture, who writes:
As the doc makes clear, Tharpe had a rebellious streak, didn’t do what she was told, and pushed boundaries in a very segregated America. She invited the all-white Jordanaires to tour with her, surprising house managers and booking agents alike. And she carried on a love affair and creative partnership with fellow gospel singer Marie Knight for decades, very much on the down low.
So perhaps this is the reason Tharpe has not been on our collective radar — we’ve been slow to admit that rock guitar was created by a queer black woman devoted to the Lord.


And if you want to see the whole clip of Tharpe performing Didn’t It Rain from the opening scene of the documentary, there’s really not a better way to spend eight minutes (bc you’ll probably want to watch it twice):

Damn.

                    <span>I don’t know if this is comforting or what, but psychologist Steven Taylor published a book two months before the start of the Covid-19 pandemic called The Psychology of Pandemics that predicted many of the behaviors we’ve been seeing over the past 18+ months, including masking backlash, the acceptance of conspiracy theories, vaccine resistance, and wholesale denial that the pandemic is even happening.
Taylor would know because he predicted it. He wrote a remarkable little book back in 2019 called “The Psychology of Pandemics.” Its premise is that pandemics are “not simply events in which some harmful microbe ‘goes viral,’” but rather are mass psychological phenomena about the behaviors, attitudes and emotions of people.

                    <span>Dr. Alan Braid, a practicing OB/GYN in the state of Texas for 45 years, explains why he provided medical care in the form of an abortion to a woman in violation of the state’s absurd and dangerous new law.
A new Texas law, known as S.B. 8, virtually banned any abortion beyond about the sixth week of pregnancy. It shut down about 80 percent of the abortion services we provide. Anyone who suspects I have violated the new law can sue me for at least $10,000. They could also sue anybody who helps a person obtain an abortion past the new limit, including, apparently, the driver who brings a patient to my clinic.
For me, it is 1972 all over again.
And that is why, on the morning of Sept. 6, I provided an abortion to a woman who, though still in her first trimester, was beyond the state’s new limit. I acted because I had a duty of care to this patient, as I do for all patients, and because she has a fundamental right to receive this care.
I fully understood that there could be legal consequences — but I wanted to make sure that Texas didn’t get away with its bid to prevent this blatantly unconstitutional law from being tested.


Braid concluded his piece: “I believe abortion is an essential part of health care.” Absolutely.

When enabled, Advanced Fraud Protection will cause the three digit security code used for making purchases online to change every so often, which protects you if your card details are compromised by an online merchant. Apple says that the feature will not impact recurring purchases and subscriptions.

This is a comprehensive guide with all of our coverage, and it&#x27;s a great resource for casual users who haven&#x27;t had a chance to test out ‌iOS 15‌ prior to its launch. Everything is organized by app or feature to make it easy to find what you might be looking for.

                    <span>iPhone users who have pre-ordered an iPhone 13 model are seeing a new prompt in the Settings app that walks through the steps of preparing for a new device.





Tapping on this prompt encourages users to make sure that iCloud syncing is enabled for all of their apps for a complete ‌iCloud‌ backup, offering up an option to turn on syncing for any app that doesn&#x27;t have it on.



The feature also explains how to use an existing ‌iPhone‌ to set up a new ‌iPhone‌ for a quick sign in process, and it offers up details on finding out how much an existing ‌iPhone‌ is worth for trade-in purposes.



Apple is likely showing this information based on Apple ID, so many customers who pre-ordered an ‌iPhone‌ may be seeing the new popup. For those who want to get rid of it, just tapping through the prompts should be enough to get it to disappear.

                    <span>With the release of iOS and iPadOS 15 today, the popular password management app 1Password has released an accompanying update that brings its desktop-class extension to the iPhone and iPad.





With iOS and ‌iPadOS 15‌, Apple allows Safari extensions developers to release their previously exclusive Safari for Mac extensions to the ‌iPhone‌ and ‌iPad‌, allowing users to use extensions on all of their devices. 1Password was one of the first to tease support earlier in June, and with its latest App Store update today, it&#x27;s bringing it to all users. 



With its Safari extension on ‌iPhone‌ and ‌iPad‌, 1Password users now have immediate access to all their passwords and 1Password entries right inside of Safari, including in-page suggestions. 1Password for Safari uses on-device machine learning to automatically fill in the login process of complicated websites and even automatically fills in two-factor authentication codes.



On ‌iPadOS 15‌, 1Password&#x27;s extension is even more feature-rich, featuring a complete in-Safari user interface that &quot;turbocharges any ‌iPad‌.&quot;  1Password along with its Safari extension is introducing other app improvements and bug fixes. Users can learn more about 1Password&#x27;s announcement over on its blog.

                    <span>iOS 15 is absolutely packed with new features, and it can be overwhelming sorting through everything that&#x27;s new. If you&#x27;re wondering whether it&#x27;s worth upgrading and what new features might be worth getting access to right away, we&#x27;ve rounded up 10 of the best new additions in the ‌iOS 15‌ update that you might not be aware of.





1. Android and Web-Based FaceTime


For the first time, FaceTime is expanding to non-Apple device users, and those who are on Android and PCs can join in on a ‌FaceTime‌ call.





If you have an Apple device, you can open up the ‌FaceTime‌ app and select the &quot;Create Link&quot; option to make a ‌FaceTime‌ &quot;room&quot; that anyone can join from the web on an Android device, PC, or other compatible option.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Apple today updated iMovie and Clips with support for several new features that are set to be introduced alongside the iPhone 13 models.







iMovie now supports Cinematic Mode and can be used to add, adjust, and delete focus points and modify the depth of field effect in Cinematic Mode video. Cinematic Mode is a feature that&#x27;s available on all of the ‌iPhone 13‌ models, but footage can be edited on the iPhone XS or later, iPad mini 5 or later iPad Air 3 or later, and all iPad Pro models.



The update also includes the option to add ProRAW images to movies and trailers, and options to import and edit ProRes video.



ProRes video is a feature coming to the iPhone 13 Pro models later this year, and it will allow the devices to record in the ProRes format. ProRes video can be captured with an ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ when the feature launches and it will be able to be edited on the ‌iPhone 13‌, iPad mini 6, and ‌iPad Pro‌ models.



As for Clips, Cinematic Mode video can now be imported and edited in the app. Filters, stickers, and emoji can be added to video recorded in Cinematic Mode, and ProRAW images can be added to videos. When ProRes video launches, it will also be able to be imported into Clips and edited directly in the app.



Today&#x27;s update also adds the option to add photos or videos from the Photos library with a single tap, without having to record each one into a project.



iMovie and Clips can both be downloaded from the App Store for free.

                    <span>Alongside the launch of iOS 15, iPadOS 15, tvOS 15, and watchOS 8, Apple has also pushed an update for its iCloud.com website, introducing a new look for iCloud Mail that&#x27;s viewed on the web.





The new web-based ‌iCloud‌ Mail design looks similar to the Mail apps on devices running ‌iOS 15‌, ‌iPadOS 15‌, and the beta version of macOS Monterey. It is a cleaner and more streamlined look than the prior ‌iCloud‌ Mail app for the web, but the functionality is largely the same.



Colors are lighter, the font has been updated, and there&#x27;s a new smaller compose window for writing emails that takes up less space.



Apple introduced the new ‌iCloud‌ Mail design for the web during the ‌iOS 15‌ beta testing process and it was previously limited to the beta.icloud.com site, but it has now been released for the main iCloud.com website.



Apple today also made the Hide My Email and Custom Email Domain features live on the main iCloud.com site. Hide My Email is designed to allow users to create throwaway emails that forward to a main email address. With this feature, users can create different email addresses for different websites and then disable them if spam emails ever start arriving.





Custom Email Domains are designed to allow customers to use their own custom email addresses with the ‌iCloud‌ Mail feature. Domain records need to be updated with Apple&#x27;s settings, so access to the domain&#x27;s registrar is required.





All of these new features can be accessed by logging into the iCloud.com website. The Custom Email Domain and Hide My Email features can be accessed by clicking on your name and choosing &quot;Settings.&quot;

                    <span>The iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 updates that were released today add improved anti-spoofing models for Face ID, further improving the security of facial recognition on the iPhone X and later and the iPad Pro models.





According to Apple&#x27;s security support document for the updates, there was a Face ID vulnerability that could allow a Face ID ‌iPhone‌ to be unlocked and authenticated using a 3D model constructed to look like the ‌iPhone‌&#x27;s owner.



Apple says that this issue has been resolved through improvements to the Face ID feature, which is available on the ‌iPhone‌ X, iPhone XR, ‌iPhone‌ XS (all models), iPhone 11 (all models), iPhone 12 (all models), ‌iPad Pro‌ (11-inch), and ‌iPad Pro‌ (3rd generation).



There are a number of other security fixes included in the ‌iOS 15‌ update, but none of the exploits were listed as being used in the wild. There was an issue with the Neural Engine that could allow an application to execute arbitrary code with system privileges on devices with a Neural Engine, and a CoreML bug could let attackers cause unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution.



Apple also addressed issues with FontParser, Preferences, Siri, WebKit, and WiFi, all of which are outlined in Apple&#x27;s full security document.



For those not particularly interested in the feature set that ‌iOS 15‌ offers, it may still be a good idea to upgrade just to get the full suite of security fixes that Apple has deployed.

                    <span>Apple is continuing to phase out the headphone jack from its iOS devices, and the iPad mini 6 is the latest iPad to see the feature removed.





The prior-generation iPad mini 5, released in 2019, had a headphone jack located at the top of the device, but the ‌iPad mini 6‌ does not include this feature. With no headphone jack, the ‌iPad mini 6‌ supports only Bluetooth-enabled headphones or headphones able to connect to the USB-C port on the device.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Apple today released tvOS 15, the newest version of the tvOS operating system designed for the Apple TV 4K and the ‌Apple TV‌ HD.





The tvOS 15 update can be downloaded over the air through the Settings app on the ‌‌‌Apple TV‌‌‌ by going to System -&gt; Software Update. ‌‌‌Apple TV‌‌‌ owners who have automatic software updates turned on will be upgraded to ‌tvOS 15 automatically.



Apple&#x27;s tvOS updates are never as grand as its iOS updates, but tvOS 15 does introduce a few notable new features.



A new &quot;Shared With You&quot; section in tvOS will aggregate any content that people have recommended to you through the Messages app so you can check them out at your convenience.



When you use the ‌Apple TV‌ with your AirPods Pro or AirPods Max, there&#x27;s now support for spatial audio for a theater-like surround sound experience. There&#x27;s also a new feature for automatically connecting your AirPods through Smart ‌AirPods‌ routing.



Using Hey Siri commands, you can launch Apple TV+ shows in tvOS 15, and two HomePod mini speakers can now be paired with an ‌Apple TV‌ 4K for surround sound. Those with HomeKit cameras can view multiple cameras at the same time on the ‌Apple TV‌.



When the SharePlay FaceTime feature launches later this year, the option that allows multiple people to watch TV shows or movies together will integrate with tvOS. There&#x27;s even a new &quot;For All of You&quot; recommendation engine that will suggest content everyone might enjoy.



For more on tvOS 15 and the ‌Apple TV‌, we have a dedicated roundup that outlines the new features. Apple has also released a 8.4.6 update for older ‌Apple TV‌ devices.

                    <span>In addition to claiming that iPhone 14 Pro models will feature a hole-punch display design and a 48-megapixel Wide lens for the rear camera system, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo outlined his expectations for future iPhones beyond that.





In a research note seen by MacRumors, Kuo said that while he previously predicted that Apple would launch its first iPhones with under-screen Touch ID in the second half of 2022, he now expects the devices to be released in the second half of 2023 due to slower than expected progress with development. Likewise, Kuo now expects Apple&#x27;s first foldable iPhone to launch in 2024, compared to 2023 previously.



Kuo did not provide any further details, including which iPhone models might gain an under-screen fingerprint sensor. It&#x27;s likely that under-screen Touch ID would complement Face ID, providing users with multiple biometric authentication options.

                    <span>Just a few days after iPhone 13 pre-orders began, well-known Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is looking ahead. In a research note seen by MacRumors, Kuo shared some of his key hardware expectations for next year&#x27;s tentatively named iPhone 14 Pro models, including a hole-punch display and a 48-megapixel Wide lens for the rear camera system.





A hole-punch design refers to a display with only a small circular cutout for the front camera, as seen on many recent Samsung smartphones. This design would result in the notch being removed, with Face ID sensors likely moved under the display. Kuo said Apple is also working on iPhones with under-screen Touch ID for release in 2023.



As for the rear camera, the 48-megapixel Wide lens would be an upgrade from the 12-megapixel Wide lens on iPhone 13 Pro models.



Apple is expected to release the iPhone 14 lineup in the second half of 2022, in line with usual launch timing. Kuo also reiterated that Apple plans to release a third-generation iPhone SE with 5G support in the first half of 2022. 



In line with research shared by Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty this morning, Kuo said pre-orders for the iPhone 13 series have been higher than iPhone 12 series, particularly for the higher-end Pro models.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/20/iphone-13-preorder-demand/">

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>While it has been many years since Apple stopped providing first weekend sales numbers for new iPhones, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty today said that iPhone 13 Pro pre-orders are &quot;off to a promising start&quot; with &quot;strong early demand.&quot;





Huberty based her opinion off of Apple&#x27;s delivery estimates for iPhones, which she has been tracking for many years. Shortly after pre-orders began last Friday, delivery estimates for the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max began slipping into October, with Huberty having calculated the average lead time at around 27 days. She said this is the second longest lead time on the first day of pre-orders amongst all iPhone models launched over the past five years, surpassed only by the iPhone X in 2017.



As of last Friday, Huberty said the iPhone 13 mini was faring better with a lead time of 3.1 days, while the standard iPhone 13 faced no delays.



As with every iPhone launch, it is possible that lengthy delivery estimates are a function of low supply rather than high demand, but Huberty said Morgan Stanley&#x27;s supply chain checks indicate minimal near-term component headwinds for iPhones and concluded that these long lead times &quot;are at least partly a function of strong early demand.&quot; 



All four iPhone 13 models will begin arriving to customers and launch in stores on Friday, September 24. Key features across the iPhone 13 lineup include a faster A15 Bionic chip, camera improvements, longer battery life, and a smaller notch. The two Pro models also feature a ProMotion display with a variable refresh rate up to 120Hz.

                    <span>This month, Apple unveiled the iPhone 13 as the successor to the popular iPhone 12, with improved rear cameras, longer battery life, the A15 Bionic chip, and more. As devices that are more affordable than the Pro models, but more full-featured than the low-cost iPhone SE or iPhone 11, the ‌iPhone 13‌ will likely be the most popular option among consumers.





The ‌iPhone 12‌ from 2020 continues to be sold by Apple. As it is a year older than the most recent iPhones, it starts at $699, while the ‌iPhone 13‌ starts at $799. As the ‌iPhone 12‌ and ‌iPhone 13‌ share a large number of features, should you consider purchasing the older model to save money? Our guide helps to answer the question of how to decide which of these two iPhones is best for you, but overall the ‌iPhone 13‌ is onl…</span>

                    <span>Hello! This post (like patterns in confusing explanations)
is another one in the “julia attempts to articulate her teaching strategy”
series.
I’ll start out by talking about a “backwards” approach to learning
that I think a lot of you will recognize (do projects first without fully
understanding what you’re doing, fill in missing knowledge after), and then
talk about I try to teach in a way that works better with that mode of
learning.
how I’ve learned programming: backwards
There are a lot of “basic” concepts in programming, like memory management,
networking, operating systems, assembly, etc. You could imagine that you learn
programming by first starting with the basic concepts and then learning
abstractions on top of those concepts.
But, even though I have a very traditional CS backgrou…</span>

The kids are alright, etc etc. 
 At long last, we had a bit of hockey to watch this weekend! Ahead of training camp opening up this week, the Flyers had their rookie camp last week, which they closed out with a pair of scrimmages against the Rangers’ rookies. The Flyers’ prospects split that series, taking home a 6-3 win on Saturday, and then dropping Sunday’s matchup 3-2. And while that’s all good to know, we’re a little less fussed on the outcomes of the games than we are concerned, more generally, about just how the prospects looked. So, all of that said, let’s take a look at some of the standout performances, shall we?

How did Ersson’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
The numbers don’t end up looking terribly inspiring—they’re good but not absolutely stellar—but we can still come away from this season feeling really good about what Ersson was able to accomplish. And context is important here too. Brynäs were the worst playdriving team in the SHL, with a 43.93 CF% on the season, and gave up the most shots on goal (1702, 32.73 per game average), so Ersson was facing a much heavier workload on a nightly b…</span>

The Phantoms head coach had something to say about an intriguing prospect.
 Morgan Frost has sort of been the forgotten Philadelphia Flyers prospect. Whether it was more focus drawn on the big-league team and their fortunes and misfortunes, or the season he mostly lost due to injury, no one has really thought of him as a sure-thing to contribute to this team. Well, until Lehigh Valley Phantoms head coach Ian Laperriere ranted and raved about the kid after Sunday’s rookie showcase game.
The massive individual narrative coming into the prospect camp for Frost was whether or not he can demonstrate his work from the summer at getting to that NHL level of physicality. And he has already gotten questions about it from his teammates, so the Pha…</span>

The collegiate standout thrived in first professional action and should push for an NHL job in training camp.

How did Laczynski’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
The former collegiate star at Ohio State broke through to the NHL last season for a five-game cup of coffee after being a sixth-round pick way back in 2016.

How did Wisdom’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
Wisdom was somewhat forced into the AHL with the uncertainties regarding the Canadian Junior leagues, and he did not look out of place in his first professional league season. He proved to be a valuable asset for the Phantoms, and certainly improved his stock as a NHL-level prospect. He has without a doubt risen in the Flyers prospect pool.

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *The kids played their rookie games against the Rangers this weekend and Saturday afternoon’s match was a lot of fun, with the Flyers coming out on top and a good time had by all... [Inquirer]
*... and then, in Sunday’s game, this: 
Wade Allison is hurt. Rangers defenseman Braden Schneider sent Allison into the boards and his right leg went under him funny. He needed assistance getting back to the locker room, wasn&#x27;t putting any weight on his leg.
— Olivia Reiner (@ReinerOlivia) September 19, 2021



Maybe having potential roster players play in meaningless games before training camp is dumb?? Just one person’s thoughts (opinion). [NBC Sports Philly]
*Wade Allison was one of the stand-outs on Saturday, too. Kid is so fun. [NBC Sports Philly]
*In case you missed them, last week’s final entries into the 25 Under 25 were Emil Andrae at 15... [BSH]
*...and new guy Samu Tuomaala at 14. Today we head into the halfway point! Exciting!! [BSH]
*Brady Tkachuk still isn’t signed. That’s wild. No idea how he could do it, but if Chuck could do it, that would be a lot of fun for us. [Sportsnet]
*And finally, to wrap things up for this Monday morning, Montreal will be hosting the 2022 Entry Draft after being screwed out of the 2020 draft by the entire world shutting down due to a viral pandemic. Seems fair. [ProHockeyTalk]</span>

 Relishing in the details of game development helps me build an appreciation for both the worlds of games and the people who make them. This includes environmental design I normally take for granted, like a game’s day-to-night cycle. While time of day can often influence how I play a game, I rarely stop and pause to appreciate that my game world is constantly changing. So, when developer Sørb posted a video showing off the landscape as it changes from a bright blue to golden hour, it didn’t just show me how beautiful that game is, but how lucky we are that any game has any sunset at all.

Plunder shrines, kill coral beasts, get rich
 We knew that Sea of Thieves newest season would send pirates beneath the waves, but now Rare has revealed more details behind the game’s next update. Siren Shrines and Treasuries are arriving to the Sea of Thieves, and players will be able to either track them on their boat’s map, or look for the telltale shimmer of siren treasure on the surface of the water. The reward, of course, is tons of treasure.
Some underwater enemies were introduced during the previous season, A Pirate’s Life, which included a crossover with Disney’s Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. They play a much bigger role in season 4. Siren shrines seem to have a lot in common with the above-water fort, except instead of skeletons, players have to work their way through waves of sirens, coral beasts, and other threats. They also have to solve puzzles to get to the final wave of treasure. 
Luckily, helpful mermaids will help pirates transport their loot to the surface in one go, so you don’t have to worry about the long trip back and forth with all of your coral-encrusted treasure. Coral-encrusted bottles have washed up on the shores, which give the player voyages into the Sunken Kingdom in order to find the Breath of the Sea. This mysterious potion sells and gives rep to the training companies.
Pirates can earn special coral-related cosmetics, like a ship set, scars, and even a curse by completing the new Sunken Kingdom. There’s also a Plunder Pass, which is free and offers 100 free levels of gear and currencies. An updated Plunder Pass grants some extra cosmetics for interested players.
Sea of Thieves’ new season is planned to launch on Sept. 23, and is a free addition to the game. The Sunken Kingdom content will remain in the game for players to explore, while the Plunder Pass is limited to the three-month duration of this season.</span>

A revamp for Summoner and lots of new shiny things for everyone else!
 The Final Fantasy 14 development team detailed some new features for the upcoming expansion, Endwalker, focusing on changes to the various jobs, in a Friday evening livestream.
The developer noted that changes to jobs will expand upon the systems built in the Shadowbringers expansion, rather than create new systems. As the game gets more complex and jobs can hit higher levels, the developer does not want to make jobs overly confusing.
As expected, most jobs are getting additional actions to flesh out combos and add fancy new gauges and resources to use as you fight.
There are several big quality-of-life changes, like ranged attacks from tanks not breaking their weaponskill combos. Lots of job…</span>

You’ll also need to buy it 
 Deltarune creator Toby Fox aims to release the next three chapters of his sequel to Undertale  — Deltarune Chapters 3, 4, and 5 — all at once, Fox shared in an update. Instead of just getting Chapter 3, like we have have for Chapter 1 and 2, he will release three together, up to Chapter 5. Fox said he will then put the game up for sale, though he did not list a price.
Deltarune Chapter 1 was released back in 2018, and Chapter 2 got a surprise release on Sept. 17. 
“The world has been really tough for everybody recently. So I decided to release DELTARUNE Chapter 2 for free,” Fox said. Seven chapters in total are expected, according to the Deltarune website at the time of publication.
Fox hasn’t settled on a price yet, but said that the full game will cost more than Undertale. The creator encouraged fans to spend the money they saved by downloading Chapter 2 for free by supporting other indie developers. 
Fox said he had originally planned to release chapters together once they were all finished, but noted that it’s “hard both for creators and fans to go a long time without a release.”</span>

                    <span>The metal universe is chock full of legendary, long lasting acts who delivered album after album of excellence or at least some level of  consistency, even with a misstep or two; for example, Cannibal Corpse, Morbid Angel, Bolt Thrower, Dismember, Iron Maiden, Slayer, Incantation, Deicide, Suffocation etc.

But for every one of those bands that had the right recipe for longevity and quality, there are 50 or more that never &#x27;made&#x27; it. And my made it, we mean they just had one killer album or EP and for any number of reasons, never followed that release up.</span>

                    <span>As announced at Apple&#x27;s &quot;California Streaming&quot; media event on September 14, the public release of iOS 15 will be on Monday, September 20. iPadOS 15, watchOS 8, and tvOS 15 will be arriving on the same date, while a release date for macOS 12 Monterey has yet to be announced.





While we know iOS 15 is coming on September 20, Apple has not specified exactly what time of day it will be released. We can, however, make an educated guess as to the release timing.



The most frequent time of day for Apple software releases is right around 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time. In some parts of the world, this corresponds to times early in the morning of the following day, and Apple&#x27;s regional websites for some of these countries do list the release date as September 21 rather than September 20.

                    <span>Apple has started shipping out iPhone 13, ‌iPhone 13‌ mini, iPhone 13 Pro, and ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ Max orders to customers who pre-ordered one of the new devices on Friday, September 17.





Many orders will still say &quot;Preparing to Ship&quot; in Apple&#x27;s ordering system and will continue to do so until later this week, but customers in the United States who are receiving their devices through UPS can use the UPS My Choice feature for tracking purposes or can track through a reference number like a phone number or an order number.





UPS My Choice is free to use and well worth checking out for those in the United States who want to keep an eye on their upcoming shipments. If you&#x27;ve ordered a new device and it&#x27;s shipping via UPS, details should be available soon if they&#x27;re not already available. At the current time, iPhones are shipping from China and will soon be arriving in the United States.





The new iPhone models are priced starting at $699 and the first pre-orders will begin arriving on Friday, September 24. Apple may also have some in store stock on Friday for walk-in purchases, so those who were not able to pre-order and get a Friday delivery date may still be able to get a device right on time.



All colors and capacities of the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ Max have sold out and orders placed now will not arrive until mid to late October. ‌iPhone 13‌ and 13 mini orders will arrive in early October, though some stores still have September pickup dates available.

                    <span>In the latest edition of his Power On newsletter, Bloomberg&#x27;s Mark Gurman shared his expectations for future Apple products.





Gurman still expects new MacBook Pros and AirPods to be announced by the end of 2021, but he doesn&#x27;t anticipate any other groundbreaking product launches until at least next year. Looking ahead to 2022, Gurman said Apple plans to debut several products, including new AirPods Pro, a redesigned iPad Pro, a revamped Mac Pro tower with Apple silicon, a redesigned MacBook Air with Apple silicon, as many as three new Apple Watch models, and more.



Gurman and Bloomberg&#x27;s Debby Wu previously reported that the new AirPods Pro will feature new motion sensors for fitness tracking, and they said Apple has also tested a smaller design that eliminates the stems be…</span>

                    <span>Apple&#x27;s highly anticipated &quot;California Streaming&quot; event on Tuesday had an interesting mix of expected and unexpected news, including the iPhone 13 lineup that largely followed expectations and the Apple Watch Series 7 that didn&#x27;t get the expected flat-sided redesign but otherwise matched up with rumors pretty well.





On the more unexpected front, we got updates to the iPad mini and entry-level iPad, something most people weren&#x27;t expecting until a second autumn event in October or November. We also didn&#x27;t get the third-generation AirPods, which were rumored but fairly uncertain about heading into the event.



For a look at Tuesday&#x27;s biggest announcements, check out our 7-minute recap video and associated article that links out to all of our coverage from event day.

It’s nostalgic, actually.
 Not everything is supposed to be new. Remakes of old classic songs, reunions of television shows that ended decades ago, rebooting old movie franchises for some damn reason — we like looking at the past and getting all mushy-hearted thinking about what time was like back then.
Well during the Philadelphia Flyers’ prospect showcase game against the New York Rangers on Saturday afternoon, we got a look back into what covering hockey on social media would have been like in 2004.

                    <span>In this engaging video we meet Aaron Fletcher, a traveling shepherd who has been “guerrilla grazing” and living off the land for 12 years.
He lets his sheep graze — with permission — public parks and side lots. Homeless by choice, he offers his services to small farms in exchange for food or a place to stay (though half his calories come from his sheeps’ milk).
With a tiny metal cart home pulled by his sheep, he has a bed, a refrigerator/evaporative cooler, a shower (he uses a pesticide sprayer to pump up the water pressure), power (solar panel), sun oven, a mailbox stove for heat, bicycle tire wheels and a corrugated plastic roof.
Fletcher makes cheese and butter from his sheep milk and forages for seeds, fruits, vegetables and herbs.


I heard about this from @hova414, who teases it better than I can:
An “anti-consumer” gives one of the most impressive product demos I’ve ever seen; a nonstop highlights reel of ingenious off-grid inventions. Come for the wearable teepee, stay for the solar banana bread.


My jaw legit dropped open at the solar bread part — that solar oven! It’s absolutely fascinating to listen to him explain how he efficiently uses space, public resources, and a limited amount of tightly curated technology products to live a happy and healthy life, an outcome many of us have been told by capitalism is impossible. I also enjoyed his distinction between being a selfish prepper and a community prepper:
By the way I’m a prepper, but I’m not like a normal prepper as in… I call it selfish prepping. I’m a community prepper. I’m not so interested in trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic situation if everyone around me is suffering. So I’m trying to figure out how to bring up the community so that they can all thrive.

                    <span>The Royal Museum Greenwich has announced the winners of the Astronomy Photographer of the Year for 2021. Zhong Wu won the galaxies category with a 360-degree view of the Milky Way (above, top), a mosaic which took two years to create — the northern hemisphere portion of the galaxy was photographed in China and the southern part in New Zealand. Jeffrey Lovelace’s photo of the crescent moon over Death Valley sand dunes (above, bottom) took the prize in the skyscapes category.

I have an avocado in the fridge that I’m planning on using for lunch — but maybe it’s all brown inside?! So excited to find out if I’m actually eating lunch or not in a few minutes.

If you&#x27;re unfamiliar with iMazing, it&#x27;s Mac and Windows software that provides a range of handy tools for iOS device management, and it offers more versatility than Apple&#x27;s Finder-based iPhone management system on the Mac and iTunes on Windows.





iMazing allows for hassle-free Time Machine-like wireless backups with multiple backup versions available. With iCloud and Apple&#x27;s Mac/Windows backup tools older backups are overwritten rather than being saved, making it more difficult to get to the backup that you might prefer. With …</span>

                    <span>During Tuesday&#x27;s media event, Greg Joswiak noted that Apple has redesigned the packaging for the iPhone 13 lineup to eliminate the traditional outer plastic wrap on the box, a change that will avoid creating 600 metric tons of plastic waste.





As shared in a tweet by leaker DuanRui earlier today, it appears that Apple&#x27;s solution is one already used on many Apple accessories, involving a sticker with a tear-off strip that secures the box until it&#x27;s ready to be opened.

Apple is not the only company making changes to its packaging for sustainability reasons as part of  the ‌iPhone 13‌ launch, with Belkin today announcing that its new lineup of screen protectors for the ‌iPhone 13‌ family will arrive in packaging made entirely of recycled plastic water bottles and forest certified paper.





In addition to the packaging change, which is part of a broader internal and external sustainability initiative at the company, Belkin says the Screen Protector Applicator kits made available to retail stores to assist with installation will also transition to more sustainable materials including kraft paper, plant-based plastic liners, and soy-based ink.



Belkin&#x27;s Anti-Glare Screen Protectors for all ‌iPhone 13‌ models are available from Apple for $19.95, while the UltraGlass Screen Protectors with double ion-exchange strengthened lithium aluminosilicate glass are priced at $39.95.

                    <span>Starting next month, Apple is ramping up COVID-19 testing requirements for employees. According to The Verge&#x27;s Zoe Schiffer, unvaccinated employees will be required to get frequent COVID-19 tests, while vaccinated employees will receive infrequent tests if going into an office or store.





Unlike other tech companies, such as Google and Facebook, Apple has not mandated vaccines for its employees and still does not require workers to get vaccinated to remain at Apple. Prior to the upcoming testing mandate, testing was encouraged, but not required.



Apple earlier this month began asking employees to provide details on their vaccination status, and it has been pushing vaccines through an internal vaccination campaign.



Apple offers vouchers to get employees vaccinated through Walgreens along with on-site vaccinations in the San Francisco Bay Area and Austin. Paid time off is available for vaccine appointments, as is paid sick leave for those who experience side effects.



Many corporate employees are still working from home at this point and will not be returning to the office until January at the earliest, but Apple also has a large retail workforce.



The details on Apple&#x27;s testing plans came from today&#x27;s company-wide town hall meeting, where Cook also spoke on plans for a hybrid work model going forward. &quot;We learned as a company what it means for everyone to come in everyday because we did that before,&quot; he said. &quot;We know what it&#x27;s like when hardly anyone comes in. We don&#x27;t really know about the middle range. We need to learn.&quot;



Cook said that Apple is committed to learning and tweaking its plans going forward, and he said that Apple plans to give everyone an extra three days off next quarter. In the U.S., employees will receive this time off on Thanksgiving week.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Apple is planning to use an LTPS OLED display for at least one of the four models planned for the iPhone 14 series next year, according to Korean website The Elec, meaning that at least one iPhone 14 model would still have a 60Hz display. 





The report lines up with information previously shared by display industry consultant Ross Young, who accurately claimed that the new iPad mini would feature an 8.3-inch display.



The new iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max unveiled this week feature ProMotion displays with a variable refresh rate between 10Hz and 120Hz, resulting in smoother appearing content when watching video, gaming, or scrolling text. The devices are able to offer this feature because they are equipped with lower-power LTPO OLED displays, whereas the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini have LTPS OLED displays without support for ProMotion.



The lack of ProMotion on at least one iPhone 14 model wouldn&#x27;t be too surprising, as Apple may keep the feature limited to the Pro models next year to maintain differentiation with the standard iPhone 14 models. Rumors suggest Apple plans to launch four iPhone 14 models next year, including a 6.1-inch iPhone 14, 6.7-inch iPhone 14 Max, 6.1-inch iPhone 14 Pro, and 6.7-inch iPhone 14 Pro Max, with no iPhone 14 mini.



The report adds that LG Display is aiming to start supplying Apple with LTPO OLED displays in 2022, which would give Apple another supplier of ProMotion displays for iPhones beyond Samsung, which is currently its exclusive supplier.



In the past, The Elec accurately reported that Apple would launch a new iPad Pro with a LiDAR Scanner in March 2020.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/17/iphone-24-month-financing-canada/">

                    <span>Coinciding with the start of iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro pre-orders, Apple today started offering 0% financing for an extended 24 months on new iPhone purchases in Canada through financing partner PayBright, up from six months previously.





For example, customers with approved credit can now pay for the iPhone 13 Pro with 128GB of storage for 24 equal monthly payments of $58.29, with zero interest applied over those two years. Taxes must be paid in full upfront at the time of purchase. The financing option is available through Apple&#x27;s website, retail stores, or by calling 1-800-MY-APPLE.



With the lack of an iPhone Upgrade Program or the Apple Card with Monthly Installments in Canada, this financing offer from PayBright finally provides Canadians with a way to finance an iPhone purchase directly from Apple over two years.



Update: PayBright has been experiencing issues today with the iPhone 13 pre-order process, according to complaints on Twitter.




@PayBrightCanada, the company responsible for financing, has been down since preorders started. It had been impossible to complete a purchase.
— Noah Segal (@noahsegal3) September 17, 2021
 



Unfortunately it doesn’t get through. Paybright is down.
— Fayaz😷 (@faythebest) September 17, 2021
 



The more interesting story will be the catastrophic failure of @Apple’s lending partner @PayBrightCanada

Carriers typically offer numerous deals and bonuses to ordering through them instead of Apple, and that&#x27;s no different for the ‌iPhone 13‌ launch.

                    <span>Apple today opened pre-orders for all four iPhone 13 models through its website and the Apple Store app, and estimated delivery times are already slipping into October for Pro models with the all-new 1TB storage option in the U.S. and select other countries.





iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max are available with up to 1TB of storage, which is the largest storage capacity ever offered in an iPhone. The storage option is not cheap, with prices reaching up to $1,599 for the iPhone 13 Pro Max with 1TB in the United States. 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB storage options are also available, with many configurations still available for September 24 launch day delivery as of writing.



The standard iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini models are likewise available with 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB of storage, but there is no 1TB option for those devices.



Key features across the iPhone 13 lineup include a faster A15 Bionic chip, camera improvements, longer battery life, and a smaller notch. The two Pro models also feature a ProMotion display with a variable refresh rate up to 120Hz. All four iPhone 13 models will begin arriving to customers and launch in stores on Friday, September 24.



Update: In the time since this story was published, certain other iPhone 13 models, storage capacities, and color combinations have started facing extended delivery estimates into October. Discuss your pre-order in the MacRumors forums.

                    <span>In June, we reported that starting with iPadOS 15, Apple is giving developers the ability to allocate their apps more RAM, allowing apps to use more of the available memory in the iPad to run faster and smoother.





Via an entitlement, Apple is giving developers the ability to let iPadOS know that certain functions of their apps may perform better if they have access to more system memory. Currently, Apple caps the amount of memory an app can use, mainly to ensure that a single app does not utilize all of a device&#x27;s memory, impacting other core system functions. 



Till now, we had limited information regarding specific details of this entitlement, including exactly how much RAM an app can request. However, with ‌iPadOS 15‌ launching on September 20, we now know that on the hi…</span>

                    <span>Alongside iOS 15, Apple introduced an iCloud+ service that adds new features to its paid ‌‌iCloud‌‌ plans. One of these features is ‌‌iCloud‌‌ Private Relay, which is designed to encrypt all of the traffic leaving your device so no one can intercept it or read it.





According to Apple, &quot;regulatory reasons&quot; prevent the company from launching Private Relay in China, Belarus, Colombia, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkmenistan, Uganda, and the Philippines. 



Apple mentioned these country limitations in June, but it seems that Private Relay will not be available in Russia either, after Apple apparently disabled the feature there over the last day or so.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(8 min)</span>
                    <span>Apple has made much of its iPhone 13 battery life improvements, noting for example that the 13 Pro Max offers the longest battery life ever in an iPhone. However, when you look at Apple&#x27;s own battery comparisons versus the iPhone 12 lineup, it&#x27;s the streaming video performance that the company has eked out of its new smartphones that really stands out. 





iPhone 12 mini: 10 hours


iPhone 12: 11 hours


iPhone 12 Pro: 11 hours


iPhone 12 Pro Max: 12 hours






iPhone 13 Mini: 13 hours


iPhone 13: 19 hours


iPhone 13 Pro: 20 hours


iPhone 13 Pro Max: 25 hours
 

The iPhone 13 lineup features new low-power displays, a more efficient A15 chip, larger batteries, and more power-efficient components, all of which make for dramatic improvements when streaming, as the numbers above show. 



For example, Apple claims that when streaming video, the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max last nine hours and 13 hours longer than last year&#x27;s equivalent models, respectively. Taking the same metric, the battery in the iPhone 13 mini manages 13 hours, which is longer than even the iPhone 12 Pro Max. 



With video streaming services so ubiquitous these days, not to mention Apple TV+ (and obliquely, Fitness+), Apple has clearly factored the computations involved into the power optimizations that it has achieved through the tight integration of its hardware and software. 



Of course, battery life varies by use case and many other factors, so actual results will vary, but if they&#x27;re anything near what Apple is claiming, binge-watching your favorite show should be a cinch on these latest devices.

                    <span>Apple&#x27;s online store is down ahead of iPhone 13 mini, ‌iPhone 13‌, iPhone 13 Pro, and ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ Max pre-orders, which are set to begin at 5:00 a.m. Pacific Time in the United States.





&quot;You&#x27;re... early,&quot; reads the Apple Store message when attempting to visit the U.S. website. &quot;Pre-order begins at 5:00 a.m. PDT. Enjoy the extra sleep.&quot; Apple used to do new device pre-orders at 12:01 a.m. Pacific Time, but since 2019, has been holding iPhone pre-orders at 5:00 a.m.



The ‌‌iPhone 13‌ mini, ‌iPhone 13‌,‌ ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌, and ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ Max are launching in more than 30 countries and regions around the world, and a full list of launch times can be found in our time zone guide.



All of the new ‌iPhone 13‌ models are nearly identical in design to last year&#x27;s iPhone 12 models, featuring flat edges, an aerospace-grade aluminum enclosure, a glass back, and a slight increase in thickness. 



Key features across the ‌iPhone 13‌ lineup include a faster A15 Bionic chip, camera improvements, longer battery life, and a smaller notch. The two Pro models also feature a ProMotion display with a variable refresh rate up to 120Hz. The ‌iPhone 13‌ models are available in Pink, Blue, Midnight (black), Starlight (silver/gold), and (PRODUCT)RED.



If you&#x27;re hoping to get one of the models in the ‌new ‌iPhone 13‌ lineup on launch day, it&#x27;s a good idea to purchase early because there&#x27;s no word on how much supply Apple will have. 



Pricing on the ‌iPhone 13‌ mini starts at $699, while pricing on the ‌iPhone 13‌ starts at $799, the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ starts at $999, and the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ Max begins at $1099. The official launch, when pre-orders will be out for delivery, is next Friday, September 24.

                    <span>As a child, I had a book on Ancient Egypt. While it no doubt depicted Ancient Egyptians in a completely historically inaccurate way—aka white with a tan—the chapter I really loved was on mummies. Looking back, I should’ve realized my love of the macabre was life-long because I was six years old and fascinated with […]

The sniper from Finland gives the Flyers an elite shooter in the system. 
 No. 14: Samu Tuomaala
2020-21 League/Team(s): Karpat U20/Karpat, U20 SM-Sarja/Liiga
2020-21 Statistics: 15 G, 16 A, 31 P in 35 G
Age: 18

Ranking in Spring 2020 25 Under 25: N/A
How did Tuomaala’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
Tuomaala spent the season doing what he does best — filling up the scoresheet, with 15 goals in 30 games with the under 20 team in Karpat. Against lower competition he showed his offensive upside, using his shot to torment goalies and his speed to leave defenders in their wake. 
It was a different — and expected — story against be…</span>

The 2020 second-round pick has definite offensive upside, there’s no denying that.
 No. 15: Emil Andrae
2020-21 League/Team(s): HV71/Vasterviks IK (loan), SHL/HockeyAllsvenskan
2020-21 Statistics: 3 G, 10 A, 13 P in 46 G
Age: 19

Ranking in Spring 2020 25 Under 25: N/A
How did Andrae’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
After getting a taste of the Sweden’s highest tier league towards the end of his 2019-20 season at just 17 years of age, Andrae logged more valuable time in the SHL before being loaned to Vasterviks in the second-tier league for 15 games in which he notched three goals and three assists.

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *It is rookie game weekend, with the kids getting set to take on the Rangers a couple of times. If you didn’t know the origin of these kinds of games, it’s pretty neat. [The Athletic]
*Anyhoo, day one of rookie camp was yesterday and there are a few early standouts. [Inquirer]
*So yesterday we got a look at the national broadcast schedule; the Flyers are getting 13 of them. [NBC Sports Philly]
*In case you missed them here are the latest 25 Under 25 ranked youths; at 18, the Bunn Man... [BSH]
*... at 17, everyone’s favorite prospect that will probably never crack the lineup, Noah Cates... [BSH]
*... and then at 16, the very exciting kid who got his start up in Halifax. [BSH]
*Individual teams have been making their vaccination situations public piecemeal this week, but now we’ve learned that the league expects just about everyone to be protected from the virus by opening night. [ProHockeyTalk]
*We also learned yesterday of an outdoor game to be held between the Leafs and the Sabres; that’ll be fun. [TSN]
*Bill Daly told us that he expects the cap to go up by one whole million dollars in 2022-23. Wow slow down boys. [Sportsnet]
*Sidney Crosby is just like us and wants to see Alex Ovechkin break the Gretzky record. [ESPN]
*And finally, new BSH Radio for your weekend! Naturally, we’re talking goal songs. Enjoy! [BSH]</span>

Scoot ’n boot
 If you’re sitting down and getting into Deathloop, wait! Much like the protagonist of Deathloop himself, I’m jumping out of nowhere to give you an important warning to keep in mind as you start your journey. Don’t forget to kick! Kick doors, kick people, kick everything you can.
When I first started working my way through Blackreef, I forgot that I had a powerful kick at my disposal, because I was too busy keeping track of six other things. The Deathloop designers at Arkane Studios did an admirable job holding the player’s hand through the game’s info dumps with clever writing and concise summaries, but I still felt a little overwhelmed. 
Deathloop is a good game, but it’s definitely a dense one. The time loop thriller starts…</span>

Jump from world to world with your dear friend Patrick Star
 SpongeBob SquarePants and Patrick Star will stumble through a Rick and Morty-esque multiverse in an upcoming adventure game, SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake. Announced by developer THQ Nordic on Friday, the game is “coming soon” to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Windows PC, according to a description of the game on THQ Nordic’s YouTube page. 
The game follows SpongeBob and Patrick after the two unintentionally open up portals to other universes. In the game, you’ll be able explore seven different worlds and dress your characters up with 30 skins. 
The trailer shows SpongeBob and his friend Patrick in a variety of scenarios inspired by the show, as they navigate the portals. Fans of the classic Nickelodeon show will recognize a cast of characters like the Flying Dutchman or Mrs. Puff. Also, SpongeBob lip-synchs to a classic rock song from SpongeBob SquarePants: The Yellow Album.
SpongeBob has been living his best video game life lately. The beloved invertebrate is coming to Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl, which is basically a Super Smash Bros.-style fighting game with Nickelodeon characters, and Mr. SquarePants got a fun taunt that mimics a popular meme in it.</span>

THQ Nordic announces first full sequel since 1999
 Jagged Alliance, the 25-year-old turn-based tactics series, will finally deliver its second numbered sequel — and first of this century — with Jagged Alliance 3, coming to Windows PC at an unannounced date.
Jagged Alliance 3 will be developed by Haemimont Games and published by THQ Nordic, which acquired the Jagged Alliance IP in 2015. THQ Nordic on Friday also made the original Jagged Alliance: Gold Edition free on Steam, in observance of the publisher’s 10th anniversary. Jagged Alliance: Gold Edition comprises the 1995 game and its 1996 spinoff, Jagged Alliance: Deadly Games.
THQ Nordic said Jagged Alliance 3 will be “a true successor to the beloved series.” In it, players will command a mercenary force in the fictitious nation of Grand Chien, set against a brutal paramilitary adversary called The Legion.
“Jagged Alliance 3 will combine tactically deep, turn-based combat with exploration of a large game world with strategic elements,” THQ Nordic said, “including gaining control over territories, training local forces, and establishing multiple squads chosen from beloved mercenaries — all well known to fans of the series.”
The game will also include “RPG-elements like special perks or level-ups for your mercenaries, as well as looting and customizing your arsenal of weaponry,” the announcement said.
Haemimont Games, based in Sofia, Bulgaria, specializes in strategy and city-building games, but has never handled the Jagged Alliance series. Jagged Alliance 2 was published in 1999, following Deadly Games. 
Since then the series has gotten various expansions and content packs on different platforms, including 2012’s Jagged Alliance: Back In Action, a full remake of Jagged Alliance 2.</span>

Appeal Games and THQ Nordic revive canceled sequel to Outcast
 If your response to the announcement of Outcast 2 - A New Beginning is, “I’m not sure I’ve ever heard of Outcast 1,” that’s quite understandable. The sequel was originally announced two decades ago.
The first Outcast game, an award-winning sci-fi adventure game developed by Appeal and published by Infogrames, was released on PC way back in 1999. The sequel, originally known as Outcast 2: The Lost Paradise, was announced the following year, but it was never completed due to financial issues.
But Outcast 2 looks like it’s actually going to happen this time, thanks to THQ Nordic, which is publishing the long-awaited sequel, once again developed by Appeal Studios. (The Belgian developer also released a modern remake of Outcast in 2017, titled Outcast - Second Contact, which Nacon published.) THQ Nordic says that its has reunited members of the original Outcast team, including composer Lennie Moore, to create Outcast 2.


Cutter Slade, the Navy SEAL protagonist of the original game, will return in Outcast 2 - A New Beginning. Cutter’s been resurrected “by the almighty Yods,” the game’s Steam page says, and will need to save the planet Adelpha from invading robot forces. Cutter’s jetpack will let him “jump, air-dash, glide, and quickly traverse” Outcast 2’s open world.
THQ Nordic and Appeal Studios describe Outcast 2 - A New Beginning as an open-world action-adventure game with non-linear story — players’ actions and decisions will change the narrative’s outcome. 
Outcast 2 is in development for PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X. THQ Nordic did not announce a release date.</span>

THQ Nordic’s full remake of the 2006 game revealed
 THQ Nordic is reviving Destroy All Humans! 2 with a full remake of the 2006 game. Titled Destroy All Humans! 2 - Reprobed — this is the publisher who released Kingdoms of Amalur Re-Reckoning and Darksiders: Warmastered Edition, after all — the remake is being developed for PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X for a 2022 release.
Developer Black Forest Games promises local two-player split-screen co-op, and new and improved features, in its built-from-scratch remake of Destroy All Humans! 2. The Reprobed version, unlike its 2020 predecessor, does not appear to be bound for last-generation consoles.
The second game in the Destroy All Humans! franchise takes place in 1969, and sends protagonist Crypto on a revenge mission to new locations: Bay City, Albion, Takoshima, Tunguska, and Solaris, a Soviet base set up on Earth’s Moon.
The original Destroy All Humans! 2 was developed by Pandemic Studios, published by the former THQ, and released on PlayStation 2 and Xbox.</span>

 In Timberborn, ‘beavers either work or die’
 Beavers are nature’s builders, and in Timberborn, released on PC in Steam Early Access on Wednesday, players manage a colony of these industrious critters in a post-human world. The city-building sim has a cuddly exterior, but don’t let that fool you — it’s legitimately challenging. As the game’s developer Mechanistry described it on its Twitch channel, in Timberborn “beavers either work or die.”
Timberborn takes place in a future version of our world where humankind has sapped planet Earth of her precious resources. Super-intelligent beavers have evolved and formed “lumberpunk” societies, where timber is a core resource that powers farming, river control, and society growth. Rather than city-building alone, Timberbo…</span>

 Alex Chen has a unique power — she’s an empath in the most literal sense of the word. Life is Strange: True Colors follows Alex as she leaves the foster-care system and moves to Haven Springs to live with her estranged brother, whom she’s been separated from because of that system.
The game itself begins on Alex’s first day in Haven Springs, reuniting with Gabe after eight years and setting up shop in a space that she just might be able to call home. She’s trying to live a normal life — one balanced by freedom and connection — unhindered by her empathic abilities that allow her to feel (and sometimes overcome by) other people’s strong emotions.

343 Industries says it’s not ending support, but shifting focus to Halo Infinite
 Halo: The Master Chief Collection’s eighth season of updates will be the last one for the anthology, 343 Industries told fans on Wednesday. The studio said it is focusing on giving the 2014 collection a successful send-off so that developers may focus on the launch of Halo Infinite, coming in early December.
The final season does not mean no more updates or support, 343 said. “We have more MCC work to do and support will continue,” Tyler Davis, 343’s community manager, wrote on Wednesday. However, “as a studio it’s not ideal to run and continue shipping seasonal updates for two different multiplayer titles concurrently,” alluding to Halo Infinite, whose multipl…</span>

Photo credits, from top to bottom: Ran Tian, Terje Kolaas, Yoel Robert Assiag, Oleg Rest, and Md Tanveer Hassan Rohan.

                    <span>Join cheesemonger Anne Saxelby as she shows us how to cut, serve, store, and accompany more than two dozen cheeses that cover the entire spectrum of cheese-dom, from Parmigiano-Reggiano to Cheddar to Roquefort to Burrata. This video is like a private cooking class with a very thoughtful &amp; knowledgable host — and it made me incredibly hungry. A good pairing might be Saxelby’s recent book, The New Rules of Cheese.
But….. at the first mention of the word “fridge”, I could not help but think of this classic interview with French marketing consultant Clotaire Rapaille: In America, the Cheese Is Dead.
For example, if I know that in America the cheese is dead, which means is pasteurized, which means legally dead and scientifically dead, and we don’t want any cheese that is alive, then I have to put that up front. I have to say this cheese is safe, is pasteurized, is wrapped up in plastic. I know that plastic is a body bag. You can put it in the fridge. I know the fridge is the morgue; that’s where you put the dead bodies. And so once you know that, this is the way you market cheese in America.

                    <span>After Anthony Bourdain died in 2018, I listened to the audiobook version of his fantastic Kitchen Confidential (read by Bourdain himself) and in retrospect, the trip he took to Tokyo documented in one of the final chapters was a clear indication that his career was headed away from the kitchen and out into the world. His long-time producer Lydia Tenaglia saw this too…she cold-called him after reading the book and pitched him on doing a TV show called A Cook’s Tour, where the intrepid Bourdain would travel to different locations around the world to experience the food culture there.
I met him at a point in his life where he had never really traveled before. He had written a book, Kitchen Confidential, and I had read somewhere that he was going to try to write a follow-up book called A Cook’…</span>

                    <span>When it was built in the 1920s in Turin, Italy, the Fiat factory was designed with a racetrack on the top of the building, both for car testing purposes and for racing.
The factory’s best-known symbol is the test track, which is a superb piece of design modeling, and construction that occupies the whole roof surface of the workshops. Two 443 meters straights, joined by parabolic bends, form a continuous track for testing the cars.
Originally, as soon as the cars left the assembly lines they could flow directly upward to the test track through the snail-shaped ramps completing the whole processing cycle inside the factory. Moreover, these spiraling ramps inside the building allowed the cars to be driven back down and into showrooms.


The track was a little over 1/2 mile long. Many more views at Rare Historical Photos. (via @laxgani)

                    <span>Apple today released a new update for Safari Technology Preview, the experimental browser Apple first introduced in March 2016. Apple designed the ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ to test features that may be introduced into future release versions of Safari.





‌Safari Technology Preview‌ release 132 includes bug fixes and performance improvements for Web Inspector, CSS, JavaScript, Web API, WebRTC, Rendering, Media, and Web Extensions. Apple says that Tab Groups do not sync in this release. 



The current ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ release is built on the new Safari 15 update included in macOS Monterey, and as such, it includes several Safari 15 features. There&#x27;s a new streamlined tab bar with support for Tab Groups to organize tabs, along with improved support for Safari Web Ex…</span>

                    <span>Customers who order one of Apple&#x27;s lower-cost Apple Watch SE devices will now receive an upgraded USB-C charging cable in the package, rather than the previous USB-A charging cable.





Apple is changing the cable in the box as it continues to transition away from USB-A and for consistency across the Apple Watch lineup.



The ‌Apple Watch SE‌ will apparently ship with the same USB-C Fast Charger that&#x27;s available with the Apple Watch Series 7, but fast charging is limited to the new models. Though the cable is the same, the ‌Apple Watch SE‌ will charge at standard speeds.



With the fast charge cable, the Series 7 is able to charge 33 percent faster than with a standard Apple Watch charging puck thanks to new charging architecture that is not built into the ‌Apple Watch SE‌.



The ‌Apple Watch SE‌&#x27;s product page confirms the upgrade and lists the device as shipping with a &quot;1m Magnetic Charger to USB-C Cable&quot; rather than the standard Magnetic Cable that used USB-A. Apple previously had a non-fast charging version of the USB-C Apple Watch cable, but it has been discontinued and is no longer available.



While the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ and ‌Apple Watch SE‌ will ship with a USB-C Apple Watch charging cable, the Apple Watch Series 3, Apple&#x27;s lowest cost option, still continues to feature a USB-A charging cable.

                    <span>Classicbot designer Philip Lee has created a range of robot figurines, toys, plushes, and pins that are modeled after classic Apple devices like the Mac and the iPod.





The latest Classicbot product is an updated version of the iBoy that&#x27;s available in pouch form. Lee&#x27;s previously released iBoy was made from plastic and modeled after the Classic iPod. The iBoy Phone Pouch looks similar to the original figurine, but in a larger plush format.





Because it uses an iPod design, the iBoy Phone Pouch is rectangular in shape with plush stuffed headphones for ears, long arms, and short legs. The stitching is top notch and this feels like a high-quality accessory, which I would expect at this price point.

                    <span>Both the iPhone 13 and the new iPad mini are equipped with Apple&#x27;s latest A15 Bionic chip, but benchmark results reveal that the chip is downclocked to 2.9GHz in the iPad mini, compared to 3.2GHz in all iPhone 13 models. 





As to be expected, the downclocked chip appears to have a small 2-8% impact on the iPad mini&#x27;s performance compared to iPhone 13 models. In early Geekbench 5 results, the new iPad mini has average single-core and multi-core scores of around 1,595 and 4,540, compared to averages of around 1,730 and 4,660 for the iPhone 13 Pro.



MacRumors ran the benchmarks by Geekbench founder John Poole, who said the results appear to be legitimate, including the 2.9GHz clock speed.



It&#x27;s unclear why Apple has downclocked the A15 chip in the iPad mini, but most users are unlikely to encounter any issues with performance using the device. Even with a downclocked A15 chip, the new iPad mini is up to 40% faster in single-core performance and up to 70% faster in multi-core performance compared to the previous-generation iPad mini with an A12 chip, according to benchmarks. We&#x27;ve reached out to Apple for comment.



The new iPad mini is available to order now and launches Friday, September 24. iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro pre-orders begin tomorrow at 5 a.m. Pacific Time, and we&#x27;ve also shared iPhone 13 benchmarks for those interested.

                    <span>Going into an Apple fall season, excitement typically revolves around the new iPhones. This year, however, the Apple Watch stole some of the iPhone&#x27;s spotlight due to reports, leaks, and rumors suggesting it would be getting a significant redesign.





One of the biggest surprises during Apple&#x27;s &quot;California streaming&quot; event was the new Apple Watch, not because of the features or design it included, but instead, the features and designs it didn&#x27;t. 



Flat-Edged Design? Not so fast...


In the weeks and months leading up to the event, credible reports from reliable journalists and leakers suggested the new Apple Watch would be sporting a flat-edged design. The first time we heard of the 2021 Apple Watch getting a redesign was from Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who stated in Septe…</span>

                    <span>Apple this week debuted the sixth-generation iPad mini, cellular models of which can connect to 5G for the first time. However, it&#x27;s worth noting that cellular connectivity on the new ‌iPad mini‌ does not extend to support for faster mmWave 5G.





Apple doesn&#x27;t maintain a cellular compatibility page for iPad models like it does for its iPhones, so the lack of mmWave 5G support on the ‌iPad mini‌ could surprise some Apple customers. Currently, Apple&#x27;s mmWave 5G support is limited to the iPhone 13 lineup, iPhone 12 lineup, and the cellular variants of the 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro.

                    <span>Following updates to its product lineups this week, Apple has quietly discontinued the 256GB capacity option for the iPhone SE. 





Prior to this week, the ‌iPhone SE‌ was available in 64GB, 128GB, and 256GB configurations, but since Tuesday&#x27;s &quot;California streaming&quot; event and subsequent product lineup rejig, only the first and second of those capacities are listed on Apple&#x27;s online store. Pricing for the 64GB and 128GB ‌iPhone SE‌ options remains the same.



According to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple is planning an update to the ‌iPhone SE‌ for the first half of 2022. The current model was launched in April 2020, so the removal of the 256GB variant could be a sign that Apple is beginning to ramp down production of this particular model.



During its virtual event, Apple announced that the iPhone 13 and ‌iPhone 13‌ mini start with 128GB of storage, which is double the base 64GB offered for the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini.



The storage capacities available for the ‌iPhone 13‌ and ‌iPhone 13‌ mini include 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB, while the iPhone 13 Pro and ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ Max also have a new 1TB storage option. 



Pricing continues to start at $699 for the ‌iPhone 13‌ mini, $799 for the ‌iPhone 13‌, $999 for the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌, and $1,099 for the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ Max. Preorders for the new ‌iPhone 13‌ models begin Friday.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/15/a15-geekbench-cpu-gpu/">

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(8 min)</span>
                    <span>Earlier today, we reported on a Geekbench Metal result for the iPhone 13 Pro showing an approximately 55% graphics performance improvement compared to the iPhone 12 Pro.





Since that time, additional Geekbench results for both CPU and GPU performance across the iPhone 13 lineup have surfaced to provide a more complete look at the improvements.



On the graphics side, a Metal result for the iPhone 13 (designated iPhone14,5) reveals a score of 10608 for the A15 Bionic in that device, roughly 15% higher than the score for the A14 Bionic in the iPhone 12.





The Metal score for the ‌iPhone 13‌ is significantly lower than the corresponding 14216 score for the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ due to the fact that the Pro models (and the new A15-equipped iPad mini) feature a 5-core GPU while the regular ‌iPhone 13‌ models include a 4-core GPU.



Turning to CPU performance, we see similar scores across regular and Pro devices in the ‌iPhone 13‌ lineup because they all feature the same 6-core CPU setup. A survey of scores coming in today reveals single-core scores of around 1725 and multi-core scores generally around 4600.





These scores represent a roughly 10% increase in single-core performance and 18% increase in multi-core performance compared to the A14 Bionic in the iPhone 12 lineup.



With only a handful of results registered in the Geekbench database so far, these scores are still rough estimates, but the average scores will firm up over time as more come in.

                    <span>Hello! I was talking to a Python programmer friend yesterday about debugging,
and I mentioned that I really like debugging using a REPL. He said he’d never
tried it and that it sounded fun, so I thought I’d write a quick post about it.
This debugging method doesn’t work in a lot of languages, but it does work in
Python and Ruby and kiiiiiind of in C (via gdb).
what’s a REPL?
REPL stands for “read eval print loop”. A REPL is a program that:
reads some input from you like print(f&quot;2 + 2 &#x3D; {2+2}&quot;) (read)
evaluates the input (eval)
print out the result (print)
and then goes back to step 1 (loop)
Here’s an example of me using the IPython REPL to run a print statement. (also
it demonstrates f-strings, my favourite Python 3 feature)

                    <span>Desnoyers the Destroyer, trademark. 
 No. 16: Elliot Desnoyers
2020-21 League/Team(s): Halifax Mooseheads (QMJHL) 
2020-21 Statistics: 37 GP, 21 G, 28 A, 49 P
Age: 19
Acquired In: 2020 (Draft, Rd 5, 135 ovr)
Ranking in Spring 2020 25 Under 25: N/A
How did Desnoyers’ 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
Desnoyers had a terrific 2020-21. He massively improved his point-per-game ratio, scoring 1.32 points per game. He actually led his team in scoring, besting 2021 first round draft pick Zachary L’Heureux (Nashville). This is a massive increase in his offensive production from his last season prior where he only scored 0.57 points per game. At the time he was drafted, he was known as a primarily supporting player, a grinder who is defe…</span>

A junior slump?

2020-21 League/Team(s): University of Minnesota-Duluth (NCHC, NCAA)
2020-21 Statistics: 5 G, 14 A, 19 P in 28 GP

Ranking in Spring 2020 25 Under 25: 19th
How did Cates’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
It was a little bit of a weird season for Cates. He certainly didn’t have a poor season, to be clear, but it wasn&#x27;t stellar. We know him as something of a details player, who does all of the little things right, and that’s a piece of his game that was working well throughout the season, that didn’t go away. He even took on even more responsibility as he moved over from left wing to center UMD’s top line, and played well eno…</span>

Ranking in Spring 2020 25 Under 25: 23
How did Bunnaman’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
Bunnaman didn’t do anything to impress in 2020-21, particularly upon his return to the AHL. While his brief, unproductive stint in the big leagues is completely understandable given his unstable status within the lineup, inexperience, and the general difficulty of adapting to the difference in spe…</span>

In which it’s a goal song extravaganza! 
 The Flyers did well to turn the eyes of a whole big chunk of the Philly sports fandom in their direction by declaring that, finally, a new goal song was going to be chosen. Naturally, the gang has to weigh in on what makes a good goal song and what direction the Flyers should ultimately go in.  Oh yeah, and then there’s rookie camp, and then training camp, and then the start of the BSH Top 25 Under 25 ranking. It’s a packed hour, folks.</span>

Plus a weapons rework and an Obliterator!
 Valheim, the Viking sandbox game, had an explosively popular launch. Now developer Iron Gate Studio is ready to release the game’s first content update, Hearth &amp; Home. As you might guess from the title, the update largely centers around building nicer bases. But there are other upgrades to combat, crafting, and exploration that are tucked into Hearth &amp; Home, which makes it a nice time to return to Valheim for eager Vikings.
There’s new furniture and food for players to divide, like the Darkwood building pieces, and a new stone throne and hot tub. There are also crystal walls and shelves to showcase all of your treasure, which is a nice touch. Then there are more cooking supplies, a cartography table, an Obliterator to destroy unwanted items, and a new iron cooking station for gourmet recipes. 
There are also general improvements to the game, like a weapon rebalance that makes each individual weapon feel a little more distinct. There are also 12 new food items and a host of new weapons. 
Hearth &amp; Home is a free update and plays best on a fresh Valheim world. Valheim is available on Steam and is still in Early Access, which is promising considering the game had a very strong and satisfying launch and has already sold seven million copies.</span>

Season 4 starts on Sept. 23
 A new Sea of Thieves season is about to begin, which means pirates will be granted new in-game challenges and a Plunder Pass full of rewards. Season 4 is due to start on Sept. 23, and Rare has posted a very short teaser showcasing what the new season will have to offer. It looks as though pirates are going to have to delve beneath the waves, which is a notoriously dangerous place.
Season 3 was based around the Pirates of the Caribbean crossover with Captain Jack Sparrow. A Pirate’s Life was meant to be cinematic and story based, but it looks like season 4 will return to the Sea of Thieves-specific lore and expand on the existing world. We haven’t spent that much time under the sea, but there are tons of threats down there to defeat — and treasure to obtain.

Sea of Thieves seasons come with a Plunder Pass, which includes a free and paid version. The paid version usually includes neat cosmetics, like a new coat of paint for your ship or a nice ruffled shirt to wear at an outpost. These passes also include in-game currencies like doubloons and gold.
Sea of Thieves’ season 4 is set to release on Sept. 23, and will run for about three months.</span>

Open the ClassPass door at Charlie’s to disable the ClassPass doors at Frank’s
 In this Deathloop ClassPass guide, we’ll explain where to find a ClassPass, how to open the door in Charlie’s mansion during “Condition Detachment,” and how to turn off Frank’s ClassPass security.
Maybe you found the ClassPass door under Deathloop’s Visionary Charlie Montague’s mansion during “Space Invaders.” And you’ll definitely run into the ClassPass doors throughout Frank Spicer’s club during “The Ballad Of Ramblin’ Frank.” Either way, read on to learn all about it.

 When MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries launched in 2019, it was a deeply flawed game — and to a large extent, it still is. But the developers at Piranha Games have been relentless in applying new updates to improve the situation. The next attempt, announced Thursday, is a free update coming on Sept. 23 that could allow players to bypass one of the game’s biggest flaws.
MechWarrior 5 focuses on the lance, a formation of four heavily armed righting robots called Mechs. In multiplayer, you can get other humans to be your three lancemates, but in single player the rest of your team is controlled by the AI. At launch, that AI was dangerously stupid.

Toby Fox announced the chapter as part of an Undertale stream
 Deltarune Chapter 2, the next installment of the sequel to beloved indie darling Undertale, will be released Friday evening. The game will be coming first to Windows PC and Mac OS, according to its announcement trailer. Creator Toby Fox announced the game as part of a livestream celebrating the sixth anniversary of Undertale. 
No word on when the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 versions will be released, but if you played on a console and want to play on a computer this weekend, you’ll still be able to. Players with no save data will be able to start right at Chapter 2 once it’s released at 8 p.m. EDT on Sept. 17. “As long as you generally remember what happened story-wise, you’ll be fine,” the developers said in an FAQ. 
DELTARUNE Chapter 2 will release at 8PM ET on 9/17. 
Thanks for waiting.https://t.co/dY8doW04bT pic.twitter.com/SJssTEF5gV

Deltarune takes place in the larger world of Undertale, and is intended for fans familiar with the first story. In it, you play as Kris, a child who one day accidentally fell into an alternate “Dark World” with their friend, Susie. Once there, the two are informed that they’re part of a team of three heroes destined to save it from eternal darkness. Deltarune isn’t a complete game; the only existing chapter of its story came out in 2018, and the second chapter will pick up after the events of the first.  
If you played Deltarune on PC or Mac, you will be able to carry your save file over. Just make sure you have rolled credits on it, and the completion data will generate in your game.
As for how much of the story this chapter will include, we won’t know The website confirms that there will be additional chapters to come, and that the team has only “completed Chapter 2 so far, so please be patient.”</span>

                    <span>Samsung Display today announced that it has started mass production of 14-inch and 16-inch OLED displays for laptops, and a key feature of the panels is support for up to a 90Hz refresh rate for smoother appearing content.





Samsung Display said it has been supplying the OLED panels to global manufacturers, including ASUS, Lenovo, Dell, HP, and Samsung Electronics, for use in laptops, including ASUS&#x27;s recently announced Zenbook and Vivobook Pro laptops. Apple was not mentioned as being a customer, but Korean website The Elec last month reported that Samsung Display was preparing its production lines for future MacBooks with OLED displays, and DigiTimes has said Apple plans to launch a 16-inch MacBook Pro with an OLED display in 2022.

We&#x27;re expecting a second fall event to be held in either October or November, and this event will likely focus on Macs. Below, we&#x27;ve highlighted the products that are still rumored to be launching before the end of 2021.



14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro Models


We&#x27;re overdue for a 16-inch MacBook Pro refresh, and rumors suggest that it&#x27;s coming soon. Multiple rumors have pointed towards 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with slimmer bezels and a flat-edged design that&#x27;s not too much of a departure from the current design.

                    <span>Just a day after the iPhone 13 models were announced by Apple, the first Geekbench score has already surfaced. Someone has benchmarked the GPU performance of the iPhone 13 Pro, and there&#x27;s a significant performance increase compared to the prior-generation iPhone 12 Pro.





The ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌, or iPhone14,2, earned a Metal score of 14216, a 55 percent increase compared to the 9123 Metal score earned by the ‌iPhone 12 Pro‌.





Apple&#x27;s ‌iPhone 13‌ models feature an A15 chip with 6 CPU cores, including two performance cores and four efficiency cores. Both the ‌iPhone 13‌ and ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ devices have the same CPU, but there are differences when it comes to GPU.

                    <span>Apple CEO Tim Cook is one of the 100 Most Influential People of 2021 according to TIME&#x27;s newly published rankings. TIME shares an annual list highlighting world leaders, celebrities, tech company executives, authors, musicians, athletes, and more, and this is not the first time Cook has been celebrated.





This year&#x27;s list is broken up into categories that include Icons, Pioneers, Titans, Artists, Leaders, and Innovators. Cook is listed in the &quot;Titans&quot; category alongside Shonda Rhimes, Tom Brady, Timbaland and Swizz Beats, Simone Biles, and others.



Cook&#x27;s profile was written by Nike co-founder Phil Knight, who reflected on his relationship with Cook and his talks with Cook as a Nike board member. According to Knight, Cook is a man of &quot;wisdom&quot; and &quot;excellent judgment.&quot;
One of his most difficult challenges was the change of leadership at Apple after Steve Jobs passed away, the Steve Jobs who was beloved and recognized around the world as a genius.



This almost impossible transition was handled with amazing dignity and grace, and announced to the world in his own quiet way: &quot;I am not the second Steve Jobs. I am the first Tim Cook.&quot;



And by the way, in the 10 years since... Apple stock has gone up 1,000%, making it the most valuable company in the world.
Other notable names who made this year&#x27;s list include Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, Naomi Osaka, Billie Eilish, &quot;Ted Lasso&quot; star Jason Sudeikis, Joe Biden, and Elon Musk.



Earlier this year, Apple was listed as one of TIME&#x27;s 100 Most Influential Companies of 2021 thanks to its record breaking holiday quarter and ever increasing product lineup.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/15/airtags-firmware-available-to-all-users/">

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Apple this week continued distributing new firmware for the AirTags that first rolled out in August. There have been several minor releases with different build numbers, and behind the scenes, those tweaks were to meter the number of people who were seeing the AirTag update at one time.





The last version, for example, with a build number of 1A291e changed nothing other than the rate limit on the percentage of ‌AirTags‌ users getting the update. That update set the limit to 25 percent, and another build released yesterday (1A291f) removes the deployment limit entirely, so all users should now be able to get the firmware update.



A portion of people will have already received the new firmware, but anyone who had not should see their ‌AirTags‌ updating over the next few days. There&#x27;s still no word on what&#x27;s included in the ‌AirTags‌ firmware, and no new features have been found so it likely focuses on bug fixes and other under-the-hood improvements.



It is not clear why Apple has metered the release of the ‌AirTags‌ firmware update, but it may have to do with the over-the-air distribution method.



Apple does not provide an option to force an AirTag update, as it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s done over-the-air through a connected iPhone. To make sure the update happens, you can put your AirTag in range of your ‌‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌‌, but you have to wait for the firmware to roll out to your device.



You can check your current AirTag firmware version using the Find My app, with instructions available in our how to.

                    <span>Apple this week introduced a redesigned sixth-generation iPad mini that looks much closer to the current iPad Air, with slimmer bezels, a Touch ID power button, a USB-C port, compatibility with the second-generation Apple Pencil, and more.





The new iPad mini is equipped with the same A15 Bionic chip as iPhone 13 models, and while Apple doesn’t advertise the amount of RAM in the device, MacRumors can confirm that the new iPad mini has 4GB of RAM, an increase from 3GB of in the previous iPad mini. We can also confirm the ninth-generation iPad has the same 3GB of RAM as the eighth-generation model. These amounts were revealed in strings contained within the Xcode 13 beta.



For comparison, the iPad Pro is available with up to 16GB of RAM depending on storage capacity, while the latest iPad Air has 4GB of RAM.



The same type of Xcode strings accurately revealed the amount of RAM in iPhone 12 models last year and in several previous iPhone generations. Teardowns and regulatory filings should provide further confirmation in the coming days.



The new iPad mini and iPad models are available to order now on Apple&#x27;s website and launch on Friday, September 24.

                    <span>Contrary to some recent media reporting, MacRumors can confirm that the new Apple Watch Series 7 is powered by a new S7 chip, although the S7 is based around the same CPU found in the S6 chip from the Series 6.





Apple announced the Apple Watch Series 7 during its event yesterday, but the watch will not be available until &quot;later this fall.&quot; As a result, Apple has so far offered relatively little detail about the new watch, not even publishing a specifications page on its website detailing the specific features of the Series 7.



Nonetheless, MacRumors can confirm several details about the Series 7 not currently shared by Apple. First, the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ is indeed powered with an S7 branded chip, which Apple indicates will offer the same 20% advantage in performance co…</span>

                    <span>With the upcoming launch of new iPhones, we&#x27;re starting to see accessory companies introduce cases for the latest Apple smartphones. Nomad today announced its own iPhone 13 cases and Apple Watch bands, all of which can be pre-ordered today.





All of the new ‌iPhone 13‌ cases from Nomad include a new feature called the Digital Business Card. With this, you can customize a digital card that includes your phone number, name, social media, and other information, and it&#x27;s all stored within an NFC-enabled chip in the case. This way, another iPhone user can simply tap the back of your ‌iPhone‌ and receive all of your information.








To start, the Sport Case for ‌iPhone‌ supports all four ‌iPhone 13‌ models and is priced at $39.95. It comes in five colors: Black, Lunar Gray, …</span>

                    <span>Apple never advertises the amount of RAM in iPhones, but based on strings contained within the Xcode 13 beta, MacRumors can confirm that iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max models are equipped with 6GB of RAM, while the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini have 4GB of RAM. These amounts are unchanged from the iPhone 12 lineup.





The same Xcode strings accurately revealed the amount of RAM in iPhone 12 models last year and in several previous iPhone generations.



iPhone 13 models feature a more power efficient A15 Bionic chip based on TSMC&#x27;s advanced 5nm+ process, but Apple has not indicated how much faster the chip is compared to the A14 chip. The A15 chip also has a new 5-core GPU in iPhone 13 Pro models — up from 4 cores — that Apple says delivers the &quot;fastest graphics performance in any smartphone.&quot; 



All four iPhone 13 models will be available to pre-order starting Friday, September 17 at 5 a.m. Pacific Time in the U.S. and over 30 other countries and regions. The devices are set to launch one week later on Friday, September 24.

                    <span>Amazon has a pair of solid deals on Apple&#x27;s AirPods Pro and AirPods Max today, starting at $179.99 for the AirPods Pro, down from $249.00. This is the second-best price we&#x27;ve seen on the AirPods Pro since launch, and one of the best prices we&#x27;ve tracked in 2021.

Secondly, the AirPods Max in Space Gray are down to $489.99 on Amazon, from $549.00. These have been as low as $455 in previous sales, but we haven&#x27;t seen a price like this since early in the summer, so if you&#x27;re shopping for AirPods Max this week Amazon&#x27;s sale will be the best around online.

                    <span>While third-generation AirPods were not announced at the Apple Event this week, suppliers have already kicked off shipments of the long-awaited headphones, according to industry sources cited by Taiwanese website DigiTimes. 





In a paywalled preview of its report, DigiTimes said the shipments have been &quot;slow,&quot; but production being underway is a good sign that the third-generation AirPods will likely be released before the end of the year. There will likely be another Mac-focused Apple Event this year, and the new AirPods could be unveiled then, or they could be announced with a press release through the Apple Newsroom at any point this fall.



The third-generation ‌AirPods‌ are expected to feature a design language similar to the ‌AirPods Pro‌, but without active noise cancellation. However, rumors have conflicted as to whether the new design will include silicone ear tips.



The second-generation AirPods were released in March 2019, priced at $159 with a wired charging case or $199 with a wireless charging case.

                    <span>Apple&#x27;s MagSafe Charger has dropped to $27.14 on Amazon, down from $39.00. This is a new all-time low price on the accessory, and it&#x27;s also being matched at Walmart.

The MagSafe Charger perfectly aligns with the magnets on the iPhone 12 and upcoming iPhone 13 family of devices and provides wireless charging.

                    <span>Apple has expanded AppleCare+ with Theft and Loss coverage, which includes up to two incidents of theft or loss of an iPhone, to the United Kingdom and Australia.





Offered as an additional plan to customers in the United States, Japan, Germany, and now also the United Kingdom and Australia, ‌AppleCare‌+ with Theft and Loss coverage can help customers who unfortunately have had their devices stolen or lost get a replacement without having to pay the full cost of a new device. The plan requires customers to have to Find My ‌iPhone‌ enabled on their device when it was lost or stolen. 





	
AppleCare Guide: Is it Worth Paying For?






In the United Kingdom, ‌AppleCare‌+ with Theft and Loss coverage will cost £11.99 a month or £239 per year, with an additional excess fee of £109 to replace an ‌iPhone‌. In Australia, ‌AppleCare‌+ with Theft and Loss costs $15.99 per month or $319 per year, with an additional $229 for specific incidents of theft or loss. 



‌AppleCare‌+ with Theft and Loss is offered alongside the standard ‌AppleCare‌+ package, which lacks coverage for theft and loss incidents.

                    <span>Following the announcement of the iPhone 13, Apple Watch Series 7, and the new sixth-generation iPad mini, Apple gave YouTuber iJustine a chance to talk to Apple CEO Tim Cook about the new announcements, including some tidbits about Fitness+.







In the nearly 15 minutes&#x27; long interview, Cook describes the new camera features of the ‌iPhone 13‌, specifically Cinematic Mode, as a &quot;mindblowing&quot; addition to the iPhone that places it on par with professional high-end video equipment. The interview doesn&#x27;t heavily touch on the new ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌, but Cook notes how the device has become an integral part of his workout routine thanks to its integration with Fitness+.



The ‌iPhone 13‌ and iPhone 13 Pro are incremental upgrades compared to the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro, featuring a smaller notch, improved performance thanks to the A15 Bionic, new camera features, and more. Catch up on everything Apple announced yesterday using our event recap.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Yesterday during Apple&#x27;s virtual &quot;California streaming&quot; event, Apple debuted a refreshed ninth-generation entry-level iPad ($329) and a redesigned sixth-generation iPad mini ($499). Like the iPad Pro, both devices include a 12-megapixel Ultra Wide front camera enabling Center Stage, which makes the iPad Air ($579) the only tablet in Apple&#x27;s lineup that lacks this feature.





Center Stage is a feature that automatically keeps users perfectly framed during video calls, and it does this by using the much larger field of view of the Ultra Wide front camera. 



As users move around, Center Stage automatically pans to keep them in the shot. When other people join in on the call, the camera detects them too, and smoothly zooms out to fit everyone into the view and make sure they are part of the conversation. 



Apple debuted the feature in April with the latest ‌iPad Pro‌. At the time, it was thought the machine learning capabilities of Apple&#x27;s M1 chip were required to power the feature, but given that the new iPad and iPad mini use A13 and A15 Bionic chips, respectively, that&#x27;s patently not the case.



The current ‌iPad Air‌, which debuted in September 2020, has an A14 Bionic processor, but only a f/2.0, 7-megapixel front-facing FaceTime HD Camera for selfies and video calls, making it incompatible with Center Stage. The ‌iPad Air‌ is in its mid-product cycle, however, so it&#x27;s likely to get the 12-megapixel Ultra Wide front camera in a refresh, perhaps early next year.

                    <span>Despite a smaller notch, the iPhone 13 lineup will not show users their battery percentage in the status bar, or at least, not by default, according to the ‌iPhone 13‌ simulator embedded within Xcode.





The entire ‌iPhone 13‌ series features a smaller notch, allowing for more area to display content. While many customers may have hoped that a smaller notch would lead Apple to show the battery percentage in the status bar, that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case, at least for now.



As noted on Twitter, the Xcode 13 simulator for the iPhone 13 Pro Max shows the status bar without a battery percentage, despite ample room to shift the signal and Wi-Fi bars to the left.

                    <span>The new iPhone 13 Pro models support 4K ProRes video recording, but there&#x27;s a catch if you want to capture video at the highest quality - you need an ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ or Pro Max with at least 256GB of storage space.





On Apple&#x27;s tech specs page for the new devices and in the press release announcing the new ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ models, Apple says that if you have an ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ or ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ Max with the base 128GB of storage, you&#x27;ll be limited to shooting 1080p ProRes video at 30 frames per second.



For recording ProRes video at 4K at 30 frames per second, higher 256, 512, or 1TB storage capacities are required.
iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max support ProRes video recording in the Camera app at 1080p 30 fps with the 128GB storage option and up to 4K 30 fps with 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB storage options.
Aimed at professionals, the ProRes codec offers higher color fidelity and less compression, and it is often used for commercials, feature films, and TV broadcasts. With ProRes support, ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ and Pro Max users can capture, edit, and share professional quality video right on their devices.



ProRes support will not be available when the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ models launch and will be coming in a future iOS 15 update.



Along with ProRes, the new ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ and Pro Max offer much improved Wide, Wide Angle, and Telephoto lenses with better low light performance, macro capabilities, Night Mode, Cinematic video recording for depth-of-field transitions, and Photographic Styles for enhancing images.

Existing and new iPhone Upgrade Program members can use the Apple Store app on the iPhone or Apple&#x27;s website to go through all of the pre-approval steps to get ready to purchase a new ‌iPhone‌, including checking upgrade eligibility, securing credit lines, and confirming other necessary information.



Those who are not members of the ‌iPhone‌ Upgrade Program can also select their preferred ‌iPhone‌, confirm their status with their carrier, add accessories, choose an AppleCare+ plan, and add a preferred payment method to prepare for the ‌iPhone‌ launch.

                    <span>Killian Bell, writing at Cult of Mac:
Apple Watch Series 7 is not the upgrade most of us expected to see
from Tuesday’s Apple event. The new model doesn’t sport the big
design refresh multiple sources said was coming. It doesn’t even
pack a new chip.
Is this the upgrade Apple wanted to deliver this year? Or is it
a last-minute substitution that Cupertino had to settle on
because the refresh it really wanted to deliver just wasn’t
ready to roll out?
Based on the evidence, we’re going to say it’s the latter.
The only way this could be funnier is if Bell included the theory that perhaps Apple changed the hardware at the last minute because the flat-edge designs leaked.
This is not how hardware works. These designs are set long in advance. In fact, from what I’ve heard, the flat-edge watch designs might be legitimate leaks, but they’re next year’s designs. That’s how far in advance Apple works on hardware — they were already in the advanced stages of designing the 2022 Apple Watches months ago. (Aesthetically, I am not sold on a flat-edge design for the watch. The round edges are iconic and organic.)
You can argue that Series 7 is a marginal upgrade over Series 6, but with an all-new screen (brighter and bigger), all-new crystal (more durable), and 33 percent faster charging, there are upgrades, and none of them could be slapped together.

                    <span>Citizen Lab:
In March 2021, we examined the phone of a Saudi activist who has
chosen to remain anonymous, and determined that they had been
hacked with NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware. During the course of the
analysis we obtained an iTunes backup of the device.
Recent re-analysis of the backup yielded several files with the
“.gif” extension in Library/SMS/Attachments that we determined
were sent to the phone immediately before it was hacked with NSO
Group’s Pegasus spyware.
Because the format of the files matched two types of crashes we
had observed on another phone when it was hacked with Pegasus, we
suspected that the “.gif” files might contain parts of what we are
calling the FORCEDENTRY exploit chain.
Citizen Lab forwarded the artifacts to Apple on Tuesday, September
7. On Monday, September 13, Apple confirmed that the files
included a zero-day exploit against iOS and MacOS. They designated
the FORCEDENTRY exploit CVE-2021-30860, and describe it as
“processing a maliciously crafted PDF may lead to arbitrary code
execution.”
The files with the “.gif” extension weren’t actually GIF files — they were carefully-crafted malformed PSD and PDF files that triggered image processing bugs. What makes attacks like this particularly dastardly is that the victim apparently doesn’t even see anything. It’s invisible.

Coming Thursday, comments will look different.
 Hey everyone, I’m Steph Driver, and I oversee all of our NHL sites.
This Thursday will be a big day for our community: we’re moving our comments to a brand new platform, developed especially for SB Nation. All of our hockey communities will be moving to the new platform, and I’m excited about the change.
Some of you may already be familiar with this new platform as it rolled out to our NFL communities last year and to many of our soccer sites over the summer. Over 30 new versions of the platform have been released since then, each bringing new features for SB Nation communities specifically, and changes to the user experience based on community member feedback. It’s a very different platfor…</span>

How did Attard’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
Attard had little short of a stellar sophomore season with Western Michigan. He finished the season second in total points (behind forward Drew Worrad), and tied for second in goals scored (behind Ethen Frank and tied with Paul Washe, both forwards). It was a great campaign, for which he was named the NCHC’s best offensive defenseman at the close of the season.

2020-21 Statistics: 2 G, 6 A, 8 P in 22 G

Acquired In: 2017 NHL Entry Draft, 35th overall
Ranking in Spring 2020 25 Under 25: 15
How did Ratcliffe ’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
The 6-foot-6 forward did see an uptick in terms of point production (from .28 PPG in 2019-20 to .36 in 2020-21), so it’s hard to really say his stock went down more as the Flyers added some high-end prospects since the last run of rankings. 
Ratcliffe always fit the bill of a project power forward…</span>

How did Hogberg’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
All in all, it was a fine season for Hogberg. The real highlight was that he was finally able to make the jump over to North America and get rolling with the Phantoms when their season started in January. It took him a little while to get settled, but once he did, he was pretty solid for them. He wasn’t perfect, h…</span>

 *And just like that we are mere days away from Flyers hockey-related things taking place, namely rookie camp, which starts Thursday, with the rookie games against the Rangers following soon after. Exciting! [Flyers]
*The rookie game is always a fun time, it’s a shame none of us can go to see it. [NBC Sports Philly]
*Speaking of rookies; 25 Under 25! Well, this next one isn’t a rookie. Whatever, just go with it. [BSH]
*This one is a youth though. Of the college variety. [BSH]
*Okay now we are back to not-rookies. This bit didn’t really work did it? David Kase. [BSH]
*The Flyers revealed yesterday that the team will be fully vaccinated by season opening, which is just outstanding. [Flyers]
*Actually speaking of rookies though, as was mentioned yesterday, there are quite a lot of exciting ones to watch this season. [The Hockey News]
*And these are the MOST exciting prospects to watch on each team as we head into camp. [The Athletic]
*The Avs fans seem to suggest that this year’s Flyers will be an easier foe than the team they saw two years ago. They... might need to rethink that. [Mile High Hockey]
*And finally, Carter Hart got a new mask. And it’s pretty neat. [NBC Sports Philly]</span>

The UK is Hell’s 10th circle, according to Thatcher’s Techbase
 If you’re a Doom fan feeling nostalgic for the 1980s as represented by big hair, bad fashion, and British accents, look no further than Thatcher’s Techbase, a forthcoming Doom WAD that pits you against the Iron Lady and her hellspawn.
Available Sept. 24 on “PC, Mac, Linux and whatever the hell you want to try running it on,” Thatcher’s Techbase is brought to you by modder Dr. Doom Daddy and an all-star cast of collaborators. The mod supports cooperative and deathmatch play, offers five difficulty levels, and is “completely free.”
On September 24th, Margaret Thatcher will rise from her grave. Only you can send her back to Hell. 
3D: Doom Daddy Digital is proud to present         &#x27;          , a new      adventure for PC, Mac, Linux and whatever the hell you want to try running it on. pic.twitter.com/ssSwk45EoS
— Dr. Doom Daddy (@letshugbro) September 15, 2021



The mod’s official description doesn’t make it sound like this is a tribute to Maggie Thatcher, prime minister from 1979 to 1990. “Faced with the return of one of humanity’s greatest threats, you have no choice but to head to the 10th circle of hell,” it reads. “The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.” OK then!
Thatcher is regarded by historians as one of the 20th century’s more accomplished PMs, though she consistently faced low approval ratings in her public life. One would expect that of a politician who took free milk away from schoolchildren. Tut-tut.
Barry Topping (Paradise Killer) supplies the soundtrack, which will be dropping on Bandcamp next week. The cast of voice actors includes Laila Berzins, who was Persephone and Demeter in Hades (and is also The Baroness, the big bad of Lost In Random, which launched Friday). Rafael Batista de Lima illustrated the sprites, while Core Lo Art designed the key art, which shows Thatcher-as-Cyberdemon blasting away at Doomguy.</span>

The multiplayer-only game will still arrive this year
 Battlefield 2042 won’t make its intended release date. Developer DICE announced Wednesday that the game has been delayed until Nov. 19, nearly a month after its originally planned release date of Oct. 22.
In a statement released on Twitter, DICE general manager Oskar Gabrielson explained that the delay was largely due to the challenges of working from home during the pandemic.
“Building the next generation of Battlefield during a global pandemic has created unforeseen challenges for our development teams,” Gabrielson said in a statement also attributed to the Battlefield 2042 development team. “Given the scale and scope of the game, we had hoped our team would be back in our studios together as we m…</span>

EA Sports looks to technology three years in the making to set apart its flagship title
 As Sam Rivera explained it to me, the success of FIFA 22’s new animation technology will be seen in what wasn’t recorded during a groundbreaking motion-capture session — involving 22 players all playing a start-to-finish game of soccer — earlier this year.
“We started working on an algorithm about three years ago,” explained Rivera, FIFA 22’s lead gameplay producer at EA Vancouver. “What that algorithm is doing is learning from all the data for that motion capture shoot — how the players approach the ball, how many steps do they do to get to the ball, is it three long steps and one short step; what is the proper angle, with the proper cadence, to properly hi…</span>

Break the Loop
 Deathloop is a lot of things — shooter, looter, murder puzzle, time loop mystery, and more. Even after the tutorial level that cleverly introduces Blackreef’s weird rules, it still takes a while to wrap your mind around the time loop. And your success depends on understanding and manipulating those rules.
Polygon’s Deathloop walkthrough and guides are here to help you on every step of your journey to break the loop. We’ve got a beginner’s guide with 10 tips on getting started, along with lists and explainers for weapons, Slabs (Deathloop’s magic powers), and Trinkets.
Our walkthroughs will give you all the information you need to kill your assassination targets, the Visionaries, and claim their Slabs. These missions are called Visionary Leads. They’re in our preferred order in the table of contents up above, or you can use these links (which are also in our order): Ubiquity (Wenjie), Chaos Theory (Harriet) and the Nexus Slab, Space Invader (Charlie) and the Shift Slab, Afternoon Delight (Fia) and the Havoc Slab, What Wenjies Want (Wenjie again), Lost in Transmission (Egor) and the Aether Slab, The Ballad of Ramblin’ Frank (Frank), Devouring of the Lambs (Aleksis) and the Karnesis Slab, and Radio Silence (Julianna). We also have a spoiler-filled walkthrough for the game’s final Lead and ending.
We’ve also got guides to some of Deathloop’s harder to find treasures like how to find a Cat Fall Trinket or how to collect a purple-tier Pepper Mill early in the game.</span>

A game within a game
 There’s a second story running underneath’s Eastward’s main narrative. Developer Pixpil’s video game holds a second, also-playable video game called Earth Born. Presumably a reference to EarthBound, one of Eastward’s clear influences, Earth Born is an 8-bit role-playing game with a story that mimics Eastward’s own, a tale so beloved across Potcrock Isle, Whitewhale Bay, and New Dam City that nearly everyone you meet in Eastward plays it.
Playing it with locals in different areas is one of Eastward’s sheer delights, meeting rambunctious school kids to take turns on the sticks. Like I wrote in my review, Earth Born is surprisingly deep — a full, yet small game that just ma…</span>

                    <span>For her project Topography of Tears, Rose-Lynn Fisher used a scanning electron microscope to photograph the crystalized patterns of dried human tears. Part of why the images all look different is because tears are made up of varying chemicals depending on why they’re made.
Scientifically, tears are divided into three different types, based on their origin. Both tears of grief and joy are psychic tears, triggered by extreme emotions, whether positive or negative. Basal tears are released continuously in tiny quantities (on average, 0.75 to 1.1 grams over a 24-hour period) to keep the cornea lubricated. Reflex tears are secreted in response to an irritant, like dust, onion vapors or tear gas.
All tears contain a variety of biological substances (including oils, antibodies and enzymes) suspended in salt water, but as Fisher saw, tears from each of the different categories include distinct molecules as well. Emotional tears, for instance, have been found to contain protein-based hormones including the neurotransmitter leucine enkephalin, a natural painkiller that is released when the body is under stress.

That’s right, the comments. They are always good, often great, and occasionally sublime. Years and even decades after most websites have removed their comment sections for being toxic and unwieldy, Cup of Jo readers are in there delivering on the original promise of the web as a way to connect humans with one another by providing advice, reflections, stories, and support to each other.

                    <span>In this wonderful short documentary by Lydia Cornett, we meet Yves Deshommes and observe him moving through his many responsibilities and interests in life, including being an NYC concierge, art dealing, raising his daughter, playing the violin, and helping his home country of Haiti.
Deshommes, who grew up in Haiti, came to New York on a student visa in 1985. He was seventeen years old, and when his visa expired he became undocumented. He lived with an older brother and took classes day and night and through the summer in order to finish high school in two years. “I became a man the moment I set foot on U.S. soil, full of responsibility,” he told me. He started playing the violin a few years later, with teachers at the Harlem School of the Arts. He was soon practicing several hours a day and working long shifts at Pizza Hut. He felt that he was too old to train as a professional, but his practice had become central to his life: “Music was the escape, music was the goal. Music was what made me achieve great things,” he said. “The violin gives me a discipline where I feel I can conquer anything.”

                    <span>Apple today held its annual iPhone-centric event, introducing the iPhone 13 mini, ‌iPhone 13‌, ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro, and ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro Max. We also got a look at the new Apple Watch Series 7 and were surprised with the new ninth-generation low-cost iPad and the iPad mini 6.

                    <span>With the launch of the iPhone 13 mini, ‌iPhone 13‌, ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro, and ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro Max, Apple introduced several updated camera features, some of which are hardware based and some of which are software based.





Notably, the ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro and ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro Max now have identical camera systems, a departure from the different cameras featured in the iPhone 12 Pro and the 12 Pro Max. As usual, the ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro models have the best camera systems, while the more affordable ‌iPhone 13‌ models have step-down cameras that lack some of the Pro capabilities.



iPhone 13 and 13 mini Camera Specs


The ‌iPhone 13‌ and 13 mini feature a dual-lens camera system. The Wide lens features an f/1.6 aperture, while the Ultra Wide features an f/2.4 aperture. The updated Ultra Wide…</span>

                    <span>Apple hasn&#x27;t released full details on the Apple Watch Series 7 as of yet because it&#x27;s not set to launch until later this fall, but the new Apple Watch bands that came out today confirm that the Series 7 will be available in 41mm and 45mm sizes.





The 41mm ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ replaces the 40mm Apple Watch Series 6, while the 45mm ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ replaces the 44mm ‌Apple Watch Series 6‌.



41 and 45mm size updates were rumored, as was the significant redesign for the display, but the design of the Apple Watch itself came as a surprise. Multiple rumors from Jon Prosser, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Bloomberg, and other sources suggested the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ would see a flat-edged design similar to the iPhone 12 models, but that did not happen.



Instead, Appl…</span>

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Apple today indicated that &quot;back-glass only&quot; damage on iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 models is now eligible for repair under AppleCare+ for a reduced fee of $29 in the United States, $39 in Canada, £25 in the UK, or the equivalent in other countries.





Prior to this change, cracked or damaged back glass on an iPhone 12 cost $99 to be repaired if the device was covered by an AppleCare+ plan.



In order to qualify for the $29 repair, the iPhone must be covered by AppleCare+ and have no additional damage beyond the damaged back glass that would prevent Apple from replacing the back glass, such as a bent or dented enclosure.



Back glass repairs at the reduced rate are not available on models older than the iPhone 12, according to Apple. More details are available on the iPhone Repair and Service website and in the newly updated AppleCare+ terms and conditions.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(8 min)</span>
                    <span>According to the technical specifications for the iPhone 13, ‌iPhone 13‌ mini, ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro, and ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro Max, all of the devices include dual eSIM support, which is a feature that&#x27;s new to the iPhone lineup this year.





Dual eSIM support means that the ‌iPhone 13‌ models can use two eSIMs simultaneously rather than just one eSIM and one nano-SIM.



Prior ‌iPhone‌ models like the iPhone 12 had dual-SIM support, but only worked with an eSIM and a physical nano-SIM. The ‌iPhone 13‌ models still support eSIM and nano-SIM, but also support two eSIMs for adopting carrier plans without a physical SIM card.



Apple&#x27;s ‌iPhone 13‌ models will not ship with a physical SIM card this year and carriers will instead use eSIM capabilities for activation. Because eSIM activation is being used for devices connected to a carrier when ordering, a WiFi connection will be needed for setup. From Apple:

Carrier-connected iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro models will arrive ready to activate with eSIM and can connect to your cellular voice and data service without a physical SIM card. You will need a Wi-Fi connection for setup.



To activate eSIM on an unconnected iPhone, please contact the carrier of your choice when you&#x27;re ready.


Connecting with a carrier later can be done by inserting a physical SIM or contacting a carrier for eSIM activation.



The ‌iPhone 13‌ models will be available for pre-order on Friday, September 17, and will officially launch on Friday, September 24.

                    <span>Apple&#x27;s iPhone 13 models are nearly identical in design to the iPhone 12 models, but there are some slight differences in weight and thickness.





All of the ‌iPhone 13‌ models are heavier than their ‌iPhone 12‌ counterparts, likely due to the larger batteries that are inside and the thickness increase. Weight comparisons are below.



 	
‌iPhone 13‌ mini - 141 grams vs. 135 grams


 	
‌iPhone 13‌ - 174 grams vs. 164 grams


 	
‌iPhone 13‌ Pro - 204 grams vs. 189 grams


 	
‌iPhone 13‌ Pro Max - 240 grams vs. 228 grams




The ‌iPhone 13‌ models are a bit thicker than the iPhone 12 Pro models, which is in line with what we were expecting from rumors. All of the ‌iPhone 13‌ models are 7.65mm thick, up from 7.4mm for the ‌iPhone 12‌ lineup.



Height and width of the new models are the same compared to the ‌iPhone 12‌, but the change in thickness and the new design for the cameras for some models will mean the iPhone 12 cases likely won&#x27;t fit ‌iPhone 13‌ models.

                    <span>In the wake of announcements for a new iPad mini and new iPad, Expercom has introduced the first cash discounts on these 2021 tablets. Expercom typically is the first Apple reseller to have solid discounts on its latest products, but shoppers should note estimated shipping times can stretch as far as six weeks.

                    <span>Following the launch of the iPhone 13 Pro and ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro Max earlier today, which features ProMotion displays with a variable 120Hz refresh rate, Samsung has come out in an apparent jab to Apple for being late to join the wider industry in adopting higher refresh displays.





In a tweet as the Apple event was underway earlier today, the official Samsung Mobile account tweeted &quot;We’ve been refreshing at 120Hz for a while now...&quot; While Apple has been widely rumored to adopt ProMotion in its iPhone over the past few years, Samsung has only just recently adopted a 120Hz refresh rate. 




We’ve been refreshing at 120Hz for a while now...
— Samsung Mobile US (@SamsungMobileUS) September 14, 2021
 


The first flagship Samsung smartphone to adopt a 120Hz refresh rate was the Galaxy S20, released in March of 2020, meaning Samsung may be slightly exaggerating the timeline in its tweet.



The ‌‌iPhone 13‌‌ Pro and ‌‌iPhone 13‌‌ Pro Max, alongside the ‌‌iPhone 13‌‌ and ‌‌iPhone 13‌‌ mini, feature smaller notches, faster performance, and improved cameras. Catch up on all the announcements from Apple&#x27;s event today right here on our website.

                    <span>Apple&#x27;s new iPhone 13 models that were released today feature an updated TrueDepth camera and a new design for the notch, which has been slimmed down.





Apple said on stage that the notch is now 20 percent less wide than the notch used in prior models, but comparisons between the iPhone 12 and ‌iPhone 13‌ confirm that the new notch design is just a tad bit taller.



In the overlay above, you can see the size difference in action. The notch is indeed a good bit smaller, and the tiny increase in height is barely noticeable.



The new notch design is in line with rumors that we heard during the beta testing period, which pointed to a design that was more compact and just a tiny bit taller.



Next year, Apple may do away with the notch entirely. Rumors suggest that at least some models will have no notch with a design that instead incorporates a hole-punch cutout for the front-facing camera, with Apple to adopt under-display Face ID.

                    <span>Apple today began selling certified refurbished models of the Apple TV 4K and Apple TV HD with the redesigned Siri Remote for the first time in the United States, Canada, and many European countries, with prices discounted by around 15% as usual.





In the United States, for example, a refurbished Apple TV 4K with 32GB of storage and the redesigned Siri Remote is priced at $149, compared to $179 brand new. Or, customers can bump up to a refurbished 64GB Apple TV 4K for $169, compared to $199 brand new. Apple is also offering refurbished Apple TV HD models with the redesigned Siri Remote.



Apple says all of its refurbished products are thoroughly cleaned, inspected, and guaranteed to be fully functional, and in many cases, Apple&#x27;s refurbished products are virtually indistinguishable from brand new products.



The new Apple TV 4K with the redesigned Siri Remote debuted in April, with other key features including Wi-Fi 6 and HDMI 2.1.

                    <span>Coinciding with the new Apple Watch Series 7 debut, Apple has unveiled some new watch faces that will be exclusive to the new model.





Amongst the new faces are Modular Max, World Time, Contour Face, and Nike Bounce, the latter of which is exclusive to the Series 7 Nike edition.





The Modular Max displays the digital time alongside a single complication, and includes longer complications that display across the screen below, which can show information like the day of the week, outside temperature, heart rate, activity, or quick access to an app.





The Continuum watch face shows the flow of time around the edges and the current hour, while the World Time lets users see all 24 time zones simultaneously, thanks to an external dial that shows the time zones and an inner dial that shows the time in each location.





The new Nike Bounce watch face dynamically animates with a tap of the screen, a scroll of the Digital Crown, or a move of the wrist. Apple says it pairs well with the refreshed Nike Sport Loop, which features the Nike Swoosh and logo text incorporated into the weave of the band. Meanwhile, the Hermes version has numbers that change hour by hour.





‌Apple says that the price of the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌‌ starts at $399 and the new model will be available later this fall. For more on the Series 7 model, check out Apple&#x27;s original announcement.

                    <span>At today&#x27;s &quot;California Streaming&quot; event, Apple announced a new USB-C Apple Watch charging puck designed specifically with the Series 7 models in mind.





Priced at $29, the Apple Watch Magnetic Fast Charger to USB-C cable can charge an Apple Watch Series 7 33 percent faster than the standard Apple Watch charging puck, reaching an 80 percent charge in 45 minutes.
We wanted to make charging your Apple Watch utterly effortless. And now, it charges up to 33% faster when paired with Apple Watch Series 7, so you can reach 80% charge in about 45 minutes. Simply hold the connector near the back of the watch, where magnets cause it to snap into place automatically. It&#x27;s a completely sealed system free of exposed contacts. And it&#x27;s very forgiving, requiring no precise alignment.
To enable the faster charging speeds, the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ has an updated charging architecture inside. The fast charging technology is limited to the Series 7 for this reason.





The new Apple Watch charging puck can be purchased from Apple&#x27;s website starting today, but the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ models won&#x27;t be launching until later this fall. When available, the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ will likely ship with the new fast charging cable as it has the same price point as the standard cable.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(8 min)</span>
                    <span>Apple today released a new version of the MagSafe Wallet, now featuring support for the Find My network and five new color options.





The new ‌MagSafe‌ Wallet can now give the location where it was last separated from your iPhone in the ‌Find My‌ app:



Designed with both style and function in mind, the new iPhone Leather Wallet with MagSafe is the perfect way to keep your ID and credit cards close at hand. It now supports Find My, so you can be notified of your wallet&#x27;s last known location if it gets separated from your phone.




Other than new color options, the ‌MagSafe‌ Wallet continues to be made from tanned European leather with the same shielded design that can contain up to three cards. 



The new ‌MagSafe‌ Wallet is compatible with the iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max, as well as the iPhone 13 mini, ‌iPhone 13‌, ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro, and ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro Max. For reasons that are not yet known, the ‌MagSafe‌ Wallet&#x27;s ‌Find My‌ functionality does not work when the wallet is used with Apple&#x27;s Clear Case.



The new ‌MagSafe‌ Wallet is available now for $59 in Golden Brown, Dark Cherry, Sequoia Green, Midnight, and Wisteria.

                    <span>At today&#x27;s &quot;California Streaming&quot; event, Apple introduced refreshed versions of the iPad mini and the low-cost iPad, which was something of a surprise as we were expecting new tablet announcements later in the year. Both the iPad mini 6 and the ‌iPad‌ 9 are available for pre-order starting today, with orders up and live following the conclusion of the event.





The ‌iPad‌ 9, which replaces the eighth-generation version, continues to be priced at $329. It features an A13 chip, up to 256GB of storage, and a new 12-megapixel Ultra Wide front-facing camera that supports Center Stage for video calls. 



Compared to prior versions, it includes sRGB support and a True Tone display, with no improvements to the rear camera. It continues to feature thick bezels and a Touch ID Home button. 



The ‌iPad mini 6‌, priced starting at $499, features a much more significant redesign. The new ‌iPad mini‌ is basically a smaller version of the iPad Air with an 8.3-inch all-display design, slim bezels, and a ‌Touch ID‌ power button. 



It too features a 12-megapixel Ultra Wide front-facing camera with Center Stage, and it can be purchased with up to 256GB of storage. It&#x27;s equipped with Apple&#x27;s latest and fastest A15 chip, which is also the chip used in the new iPhone 13 models. 



The ‌iPad mini‌ comes in unique new colors that include pink, purple, space gray, and starlight, while the ‌iPad‌ 9 is available in space gray and silver. 



Both the ‌iPad mini 6‌ and the ‌iPad‌ 9 models will be delivered to customers starting on September 24, which is also the launch date for the new iPhone models.

                    <span>Thanks to the larger display on the Apple Watch Series 7, users can now use a full keyboard right on their wrist. Users will be able to tap or slide across letters to type, in which case watchOS will use &quot;machine learning to predict the word you’re typing.&quot; 





The new ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌, which comes in larger 41mm and 45mm sizes, features larger displays compared to the Series 6 thanks to smaller bezels. 



Alongside a full keyboard, Apple says it has redesigned the buttons and menus across watchOS to make it easier to tap on the larger displays. Due to reported production issues, the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ will be available later this fall, with no specific date currently given.

                    <span>Sascha Segan, writing for PCMag:
Well, that was bogus.
Both prominent analyst Ming-chi Kuo and extremely reliable Apple
reporter Mark Gurman got seemingly taken in this year by a rumor
that the new iPhone 13 line would talk to satellites,
something that completely didn’t happen during the company’s
iPhone 13 announcement on Tuesday.
In fact, the iPhone 13 doesn’t even feature 5G band n53, the
ground-based 5G band owned by satellite operator Globalstar, which
I had speculated was the grain of truth in the rumors. So I was
wrong, too. […]
We may never know what really caused those rumors to spark,
but I wonder darkly if it has to do with some sort of stock
pump-and-dump situation. Satellite provider Globalstar’s
stock jumped after Kuo’s report, and now it’s crashing
back to earth.
It’s possible that the iPhones 13 do contain a satellite-connectivity-compatible chip, but Apple made no mention of it as a feature. Gurman was circumspect about whether the feature would actually ship, but Kuo seemingly reported it as fact.

Norm Macdonald, the deadpan comedian, actor, writer and “Saturday
Night Live” star, has died after a private battle with cancer,
Variety has confirmed. He was 61.
Macdonald’s cancer diagnosis was kept secret from the public, but
he battled it for nine years.
Terrible news. Fuck cancer, man.
It’s hard to pick one favorite Macdonald bit, but his portrayal of Turd Ferguson on Celebrity Jeopardy makes me laugh every damn time I watch it.

The upcoming Apple Watch Series 7 will feature a flat-edged
design, similar to the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro, and the
addition of a new green case color option, according to Apple
leaker Jon Prosser.
Bonus points to Prosser for commissioning 3D renders of a fictional design.
Mark Gurman, two weeks ago:
While last year’s upgrade centered on the blood-oxygen sensor,
this year’s is all about a new design with a flatter display and
edges, a faster processor and slightly larger screens.
Today: A big nope on those flat edges. No always-on display mode for any of the new iPhones, either.

Basically, there’s a podcast for that. You can learn any topic by listening to podcasts. And it seems that every domain expert has already done some podcast interviews.
Podcasts have become my primary informal learning resource. And I built a podcast search engine (listennotes.com) to help myself listen to ~5,000 podcast episodes in the past 4 years! In this blog post, I’ll share with you my quirky way of podcast discovery and consumption :)

 No. 22: David Kase
2020-21 League/Team(s): HC Energie Karlovy Vary (Czech Extraliga), LV Phantoms (AHL), Philadelphia Flyers (NHL)

How did Kase’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is their stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
Kase played the majority of his 2020-21 season in the Czech Extraliga, where he scored at nearly a point-per-game pace on a team that finished 10th out of 14th place in the league. His 25 points was 6th best on his team.

How did O’Brien’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
It’s been a bit of a strange road for O’Brien, but after a rough freshman season with Providence College and then a season in Pentiction of the BCHL before transferring to Boston University, he’s finally looking to be getting himself back on track. He was the Terriers’ most productive forward this season—tied with defenseman David Farrance with 16 po…</span>

How did Rubtsov’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
The short answer here is that last season was a little underwhelming, to say the least. Rubtsov spent the whole of last season on loan to Sochi of the KHL, and he just never really seemed to get his offensive game rolling. There were some flashes where it looked like things were coming together for him, but we didn’t see it on a consistent basis. 
Now, all of that said, there were some things working against Rubtsov last s…</span>

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *FOLKS! We have kicked off the 25 Under 25 festivities. It’s always fun to see where guys end up, don’t you think? [BSH]
*As typically happens the bottom of the ranking ended up producing a few ties, so first up, tied for 24 (or 25, however you fancy), is a Russian goalie whose recent success has showed a bit of promise, development-wise. [BSH]
*Speaking of development, Travis Konency is a father now, which means this season we should see New &amp; Improved Konecny: Dad Strength Edition. [Inquirer]
*Meltzer, on why rookie camp is important, despite the relative lack of influence it may have on the opening day roster. [Hockeybuzz]
*Speaking of rookies, will any of the Flyers’ potential rookie players win the Calder this season? Almost certainly not. But hoo boy are there some fun kids to watch this season. [ProHockeyTalk]
*And finally, in what is truly the most exciting development of the summer, the Flyers are looking for a new goal song. And they want to hear from us, the fans. So let them know, pals! We never have to hear Feel The Shake again!!! [BSH]</span>

Ubisoft San Francisco has no word on a new launch window
 Rocksmith Plus won’t make the summer 2021 launch window developers originally hoped for, the studio announced on Tuesday. It’ll be using the extra time to work on several core features, using feedback from from a closed beta that took place in June and July.
Lead producer Arthur von Nagel didn’t characterize the news as a delay, however, saying Ubisoft San Francisco “didn’t set a hard date because we wanted the flexibility to react to feedback and to adjust release timelines to match.”
Von Nagel did not say when the game would now launch. The studio will be working on feedback in four areas — song library; audio inputs and note detection; progression and education; UI, search, and content discoverability.
With regard to the song library, “we’re committed to offering over 5,000 songs” at launch, Von Nagel wrote. The closed beta purposefully had a selection of about 500 songs. He went into greater detail about the other three development areas in a message to the community.
“We understand that this delay is disappointing,” Von Nagel wrote. “Every Rocksmith Plus player deserves to easily find the music you care about, to feel a sense of growth and mastery over your instrument, and to trust that the notes you play are heard fairly and accurately.”
Rocksmith Plus was announced in June during E3 2021. The guitar-teaching sim is scheduled to launch on Windows PC first, followed by launches on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. Following that, Rocksmith Plus will come to Android and iOS devices, too.
Rocksmith Plus will be a subscription-based service, with Ubisoft offering $14.99, $39.99, and $99.99 plans for monthly, three months, and annual subscriptions.</span>

Every trophy and achievement and how to earn all 55
 There are 55 trophies and achievements to earn in Deathloop. Below, you’ll find a list of all 55 and their descriptions broken down into five broad categories. We’ve linked to our other guides to help you get some of the tougher ones.
Deathloop Visionary trophies
There are 17 trophies and achievements that relate to Deathloop’s eight Visionaries — mostly different ways to kill them.
Pieces of Eight. While playing as Colt, kill Frank. Or Charlie. Or Fia. Or Wenjie. Or Aleksis. Or Harriet. Egor will do as well.
Ensemble Tragedy. Kill each Visionary at least once.
Alpha Burger. Kill Aleksis using his meat grinder.
Power Chord. Kill Frank using a Slab ability. Take a bow.

It’s strange and wondrous, and above all, it treats me with respect
 Of the many fantasies humanity has entertained, conquering time has been paramount, whether through time machines, freezing, or reversing. If time is the great consumer, then those that control time control the universe. It is no wonder, then, that the villains of Deathloop have decided to seize time for themselves. 
Arkane Lyon’s latest sandbox adventure deploys a time mechanic like no other game. The studio has created the equivalent of a finely tuned watch. And it’s truly one of the most incredible video game experiences of my life.

The Xbox App can stream from the cloud or your home console
 The Xbox App for Windows 10 PCs will now let players stream console games on their computer, thanks to an update that went live on Tuesday.
The game streaming that the update enables will let Xbox Game Pass subscribers play games that their PCs otherwise might not have the specs to handle. According to Microsoft, playing games directly from an Xbox console with Remote Play will provide the smoothest experience, while using the cloud will be slightly more taxing, but won’t require a download. 
Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers are currently able to stream games in browsers from their phones, tablets, and PCs, but the new option will allow streaming directly into the Windows 10 Xbox App. One thing that isn’t available yet is streaming games directly to Xbox Series X consoles, but Microsoft says that feature’s on the way later this year. 


The cloud option is limited to titles on Xbox Game Pass. Other games that players own may be streamed using Remote Play, because the game is running on the console. 
To stream games to the Xbox App from the cloud, players just need a compatible controller and an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription. Otherwise the Remote Play option is available through the Xbox App on Windows 10 PCs.</span>

Moist, even
 There have been a lot of questions about Cyberpunk 2077 since it launched in December, but none more strange that the one asked by the Polygon video team: Is Cyberpunk 2077 wet enough? We can now safely say that no, in fact, the game clearly launched without the requisite amount of moisture. The latest patch, numbered 1.31, should fix that.
As far as Cyberpunk patches go, this is a pretty small one. There were a few quest bugs that got squashed, but nothing game-breaking it sounds like. The PlayStation got a little “GPU optimization,” so we’ll have to see how that shakes out performance wise. But this update didn’t even come with a mock newscast to herald its arrival. From the description, it sounds like you might not even notice it. “Please note that the issues listed below did not affect all players” CD Projekt said in its preamble. 
But then there’s this note:
Fixed an issue where roads after rain did not look wet, which was the result of ongoing work on the Wet Surfaces System. In 1.31 wet surfaces should look more detailed than they did even before the issue occurred.



As Polygon’s official wet correspondent pointed out in February, Night City should be damp,  its surfaces sodden, and even its smoothest features covered in rivulets of water because that’s how it was described by Mike Pondsmith and the team at R. Talsorian Games when the original tabletop game launched in the 1980s.
“It always rains,” reads the official worldbook. “Every day should be grim, gloomy and overcast. The stars never come out. The sun never shines. There are no singing birds, laughing children. The last bird died in 2008 and the kids are grown in vats. The ozone layer is decayed, the greenhouse effect took over, the sky is full of hydrocarbons and the ocean full of sludge. Nice place.”
So, if anything, CD Projekt’s vision of the gritty urban metropolis is too gritty, and not nearly grimy enough. Today’s patch should fix that. You can find the full patch notes on the official website.</span>

                    <span>Oh, I’ve let it go too long again. It’s been almost four months since I’ve done one of these media roundups and there’s lots to share. If you’re just joining us — welcome but WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN THO?! — I do a post like this every few months with short reviews of all the movies, books, music, TV show, podcasts, and other things I’ve enjoyed (or not) recently. The letter grades are very subjective and inconsistent — sorry! Ok, here’s what I have for you today.
The Land That Never Has Been Yet. This podcast series by Scene on Radio on American democracy is essential listening. The episode on how a small group of libertarians have had an outsized influence on American life is especially interesting and maddening. (A)
The Legend of Korra. Watched this with the kids and we all enjoyed it. (B+)

                    <span>The Wire creator David Simon wrote about his friend and colleague Michael K. Williams, who died suddenly last week at the age of 54. The Question Michael K. Williams Asked Me Before Every Season of ‘The Wire’:
And from that moment forward, his questions about our drama and its purposes were those of someone sharing the whole of the journey. It became something of a ritual with us: To begin every season that followed, Michael K. Williams would walk into the writers’ office and sit on the couch.
“So,” he would ask, “what are we going to say this year?”
He gave us an astounding gift — an act of faith from a magnificent actor who could have played his hand very differently. Television usually chases its audience — if they love them some Omar, you feed them more Omar. If they can’t stop looking at Stringer, you write more Stringer. Never mind story and theme.
Instead, Mike bent his beautiful mind to a task that even the best writers and show runners often avoid. He thought about the whole story, the whole of the work.
Perhaps more than any in that talented cast, I came to trust Mike to speak publicly to our drama and its purposes, to take personal pride in all that we were trying, however improbably, to build. He became increasingly political as the show aged, and in interviews took to addressing societal and political issues, his arguments ranging well beyond Omar’s arc.
“I started to realize that, oh, this is not about me,” Williams once told an interviewer, looking back. “It had everything to do with … just great tapestry, this great narrative of social issues … things that are wrong in our country.”

                    <span>Epic Games today paid Apple $6,000,000 in royalties, ‌Epic Games‌ CEO Tim Sweeney said on Twitter. As part of the ruling in the ongoing Epic v. Apple legal battle, Epic was last week ordered by the court to pay 30 percent of the revenue that it collected from the Fortnite app using its illicit direct payment option.





Back at the start of the dispute between Epic and Apple, Epic added a direct purchase option to the Fortnite app, skirting Apple&#x27;s in-app purchase rules. This violation of Apple&#x27;s App Store guidelines led Apple to pull Fortnite from the App Store, and directly after that, Epic filed its pre-planned lawsuit.

                    <span>Apple will be hosting a virtual event tomorrow that is expected to revolve around the iPhone 13, Apple Watch Series 7, and third-generation AirPods. With new Mac and iPad models also rumored to be on the horizon, Apple reportedly plans to hold at least one additional event before the end of the year, and the company&#x27;s annual Back to School promotion could provide a clue as to when the next event might take place.





Specifically, on September 15 of last year, Apple extended its Back to School promotion to run through Monday, October 12 in the U.S. At the time, the extension seemed insignificant, but Apple later announced that it would be holding an event on Tuesday, October 13, which happened to be just one day after the promotion ended.

                    <span>T-Mobile today announced that its T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile smartphones will soon be available in more than 2,300 Walmart locations across the United States, significantly expanding T-Mobile&#x27;s footprint.





T-Mobile devices will be listed on Walmart.com, though customers will need to visit a Walmart store to make a purchase. The rollout follows the availability of T-Mobile devices in Best Buy retail stores and the Best Buy website earlier this year.



Prior to becoming available in Walmart and Best Buy, T-Mobile iPhones were only available from Apple or direct from T-Mobile&#x27;s website and stores, which prevented customers from taking advantage of deals offered by brick and mortar retailers.
&quot;In many parts of the country, limited competition when it comes to wireless service leaves some people with few options for plans or access to the benefits of 5G,&quot; said Jon Freier, Executive Vice President, T-Mobile Consumer Group. &quot;5G for All means T-Mobile is bringing real choice and competition in wireless to many Americans. And even though online shopping continues to grow, we know that retail stores remain one of the primary places where wireless customers pick up devices and service. We&#x27;re working to expand our retail footprint across the country to meet more people in more places every day.&quot;
Metro by T-Mobile smartphone displays will be available in Walmart retail locations on Monday, October 18. Standard T-Mobile smartphones and plans will be available in Walmart stores starting on Monday, November 1.

                    <span>Today&#x27;s iOS 14.8 update addresses a critical vulnerability that Apple engineers have been working around the clock to fix, reports The New York Times.





Last week, The Citizen Lab informed Apple about a new zero-click iMessage exploit targeting Apple&#x27;s image rendering library. Called FORCEDENTRY, the exploit could infect an iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, or Mac with the Pegasus spyware, providing access to the camera and microphone in addition to allowing access to text messages, phone calls, and emails.



FORCEDENTRY was distributed by Israel&#x27;s NSO Group to governments and various other entities, and The Citizen Lab discovered it after analyzing the ‌iPhone‌ of a Saudi activist. Details were sent to Apple on September 7, and Apple took a week to fix the bug. According to The Cit…</span>

                    <span>The Acura MDX is Honda&#x27;s luxury-brand three-row SUV, and with the recent launch of the 2022 model, the MDX now supports wireless CarPlay. The MDX is Acura&#x27;s first vehicle with wireless ‌CarPlay‌, and I recently had a chance to check out the updated model and some of its new features.





The MDX starts at $47,200, but my test vehicle was equipped Acura&#x27;s Super Handling All-Wheel Drive, Technology Package, and sporty A-Spec Package, which pushed the sticker price over $57,000. A high-end Advance Package with a few additional features would see the MDX top out at just over $60,000.

The Acura infotainment system remains fairly similar to the system I tested in the 2019 version of the RDX, Acura&#x27;s smaller two-row SUV, although the MDX comes with …</span>

                    <span>The AI-powered fitness gym &quot;Tempo&quot; today announced integration with the Apple Watch, allowing Tempo customers to sync their workouts and fitness and health data directly to their Apple Watch.





Amongst its demographic of users, Tempo says that more than 70% are iPhone users, with a smaller 35% owning an Apple Watch. Tempo had been teasing Apple Watch integration for some time, and with it finally arriving, Tempo customers now have access to a host of settings, features, and data right on their wrist. During workouts, for example, customers can pause and resume sessions without needing to touch the Tempo display, minimizing distractions and wasted time. 



More importantly, Apple Watch integration means that Tempo customers will no longer need to rely on third-party or external health monitoring equipment during their workouts. Using the built-in sensors on the Apple Watch, Tempo customers can now access their heart rate, calorie burn, and additional data synced with their Tempo workouts.



For those unfamiliar with Tempo, the company calls itself &quot;the only home gym with interactive coaching&quot; that uses 3D sensors with advanced AI technology to help customers perfect their form and workouts during training. Tempo offers not only real-time feedback but also coaching and &quot;premium&quot; dumbells worth upwards of $1,000.

The new ‌‌‌‌‌‌‌macOS Big Sur‌‌‌‌‌‌ 11.6 update can be downloaded all eligible Macs using the Software Update section of System Preferences.



According to Apple&#x27;s release notes, ‌macOS Big Sur‌ improves the security of macOS and is recommended for all users. Apple has also released security update 2021-005 for macOS Catalina, and both updates address an issue that could allow a maliciously crafted PDF to execute code.

                    <span>Apple today released iOS 14.8, marking the eighth major update to the iOS operating system that came out in September 2020. iOS 14.8 comes two months after the release of iOS 14.7, an update that introduced MagSafe Battery Pack support.





The iOS 14.8 update can be downloaded for free and the software is available on all eligible devices over-the-air in the Settings app. To access the new software, go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update. Apple has also released a new version if iPadOS 14. 



According to Apple&#x27;s release notes, iOS 14.8 is a security-focused update that is recommended for all users. Apple&#x27;s security support document outlines two major fixes that have been implemented for issues that Apple says may have been actively exploited. 



There is a CoreGraphics bug that could allow a maliciously crafted PDF to lead to arbitrary code execution, as well as a WebKit vulnerability that could allow maliciously crafted web content to execute code.



iOS 14.8 could one of the final updates to the iOS 14 operating system as we&#x27;re expecting the iOS 15 update to be released in just a couple of weeks, but Apple has said that it plans to allow people to keep using iOS 14 if they don&#x27;t want to upgrade to ‌iOS 15‌. For that reason, ‌iOS 14‌ may continue to get small security updates over time, but new features will likely be limited to ‌iOS 15‌.



Update 10:16 a.m.: Apple has also released watchOS 7.6.2 with similar security fixes for Apple Watch Series 3 and later.

A new video report by The Wall Street Journal, which required watching over 74 episodes of ‌Apple TV+‌ shows, including Ted Lasso, The Morning Show, Defending Jacob, and Trying, outlines precisely how and why Apple product placements are done throughout specific episodes.

                    <span>With the launch of iOS 14.2, Apple introduced a new Shazam Music Recognition toggle for the Control Center, giving iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch users a quick and easy way to identify what music is playing.





Music Recognition has been a popular Control Center integration, and according to Apple, Shazam just surpassed 1 billion cumulative recognitions from the Control Center on iOS devices.



Compared to the standard Shazam app, Music Recognition is unique because it allows users to identify songs playing in their favorite apps, TV shows, and movies even while wearing headphones, a feature available in addition to the option to identify songs playing out loud.



The number one most Shazamed track from the Control Center is Bruno Mars&#x27; &quot;Talking to the Moon,&quot; with a list of…</span>

                    <span>Apple Maps team members wearing specialized camera-equipped backpacks will be walking in Canada&#x27;s three largest cities of Toronto, Montréal, and Vancouver through October to help improve the Apple Maps app.

Apple typically drives a fleet of vehicles around the world to collect Maps data, including street-level imagery for its Look Around feature, but it conducts pedestrian surveys &quot;in areas where vehicles simply can&#x27;t go.&quot; Apple promises that the pedestrian surveys offer the &quot;same privacy protections as the Apple Maps vehicles.&quot;



A list of locations maintained on Apple&#x27;s website reveals that the company began the pedestrian surveys in Toronto, Montréal, and Vancouver on September 11. Apple will also be surveying the Region of Durham immediately east of Toronto.



Apple says it is committed to protecting the public&#x27;s privacy while conducting these surveys. In line with Google&#x27;s Street View, Apple censors faces and license plates in imagery made available through its Look Around feature. If you have comments or questions about this process, your privacy rights, or would like to request that a face, license plate, or your own house be censored, Apple says to email mapsimagecollection@apple.com.



Introduced in iOS 13, Look Around provides 3D street-level imagery that can be zoomed and panned. The feature is already available in Canada, but Apple periodically revisits some locations &quot;in an effort to maintain a high-quality, up-to-date map.&quot; Look Around is also available in parts of the United States, UK, Ireland, and Japan.

                    <span>As is frequently the case, Apple’s 2021 product launch schedule seems to be weighted toward the latter part of the year, with a number of new products still expected to debut. While Apple is planning to hold an event this week, it won&#x27;t include everything Apple&#x27;s expected to announce before the year ends. 





On Tuesday, September 14, Apple will be holding its &quot;California streaming&quot; event, which is expected to include the release of the brand new iPhone 13, Apple Watch Series 7, and possibly the third-generation AirPods. 



Given we&#x27;re expecting several new products before the end of the year, it&#x27;s important to note that this single event, out of what is likely to be at least two events of this fall, will not include the launch of everything we&#x27;re expecting. Here&#x27;s a quick run…</span>

                    <span>Amazon today is offering the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it&#x27;s available in Gold and Silver.

The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we&#x27;ve ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you&#x27;re willing to wait a few weeks, it&#x27;s worth locking in this price while it&#x27;s available.

                    <span>The upcoming sixth-generation iPad mini will feature volume buttons on the top side of the device to accommodate a full-size Apple Pencil, according to images seemingly from an accessory maker shared by the Twitter user known as &quot;Majin Bu.&quot;





The images purportedly depict the sixth-generation ‌iPad mini‌ with an iPad Air-style all-screen design, featuring squared-off edges, a Touch ID fingerprint scanner in the power button, and no Home Button, as has been previously rumored. The most noticeable change that differentiates the sixth-generation ‌iPad mini‌&#x27;s design from that of the iPad Air is the relocation of the volume buttons, with the buttons being moved opposite the ‌Touch ID‌ power button on the top edge of the device.

                    <span>Ahead of the iPhone 13&#x27;s big reveal on Tuesday, expected during Apple&#x27;s &quot;California streaming&quot; event, new images are claiming to offer us a look at new case color options for the upcoming iPhone lineup.





Apple often provides new color options for its silicone and leather case collections seasonally, and with the ‌iPhone 13‌ release, new color options can reasonably be expected. Images shared on Twitter allegedly give us a look at the new color options for the upcoming silicone ‌iPhone 13‌ case lineup.





According to the images shared, Apple will provide eight color options for the lineup, which, compared to the current iPhone 12 silicone cases, are slightly brighter and more vibrant. The tweet depicts two images, one with an alleged screenshot of the new cases, while the…</span>

                    <span>Epic Games has filed an appeal against the ruling in its case against Apple, further prolonging the already year-long legal battle between the two companies. 





The ruling, announced on Friday, sided with Apple on nine out of the ten counts that ‌Epic Games‌ had presented against the company. Epic, from the start, had alleged that Apple is anti-competitive and that it should open up its devices to third-party app stores, third-party in-app payment methods, and more. The judge said that while the trial showed that Apple &quot;is engaging in anticompetitive conduct under California’s competition laws,&quot; ‌Epic Games‌ failed to prove the company is an illegal monopolist or that it violates anti-trust laws.



The judge most notably ordered Apple not to prohibit developers from adding li…</span>

Responding to a query about new Macs, Gurman tweeted that &quot;there will be two events,&quot; and said he expected the latter to feature both new Mac models and new iPads. In his latest &quot;Power On&quot; newsletter, Gurman said the second event will happen in the next &quot;several weeks.&quot;



With several Apple product lines expected to see new additions this year, speculation had mounted regarding how many events Apple will hold in the remainder of 2021. Predictions had been further fueled by the fact that last year Apple held three separate e…</span>

The seventh-rounder from 2015 has had a slow path to prospect relevance, but his recent success at the KHL level got him to the final spot on our rankings.
 No. 25: Ivan Fedotov
2020-21 League/Team(s): Traktor Chelyabinsk (KHL)
2020-21 Statistics: 14-7-3, 2.21 GAA, .925 SV% in 26 GP

Ranking in Spring 2020 25 Under 25: n/a
How did Fedotov’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
Fedotov had his second straight plus season as a goalie in the KHL — generally considered the second-best hockey league in the world — and as such it looks like he’s trending in the right direction. It’s been a slow path to prospect relevance for Fedotov, which is maybe …</span>

And they want your help! 
 Flyers fans, our long national nightmare is over: 
“Feel The Shake” is going away. 
The Flyers have had a long history of many, many goal songs. They have highlighted most of them here, with jumbled letters. For some reason. The Youths probably understand this.

After a long, weird pause, the 25 Under 25 is back for your and our enjoyment.
 After the longest hiatus we’ve had since we did our first-ever BSH Flyers Top 25 Under 25 back in February 2014 (my god, look at some of these names), we’re back with another version. For those of you who partook in our Community Ballot voting, thank you for your input once again. For those of you who didn’t, I’m sorry about your life choices.
Anywho! The 25 Under 25 is a sometimes-more-than-yearly-but-at-least-yearly series that we here at BSH take part in as we look to evaluate the young talent in — and, in turn, the future of — the Flyers’ organization. We take every player under 25 that’s either under contract or on the Flyers’ reserve list, and ... we r…</span>

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *Just as it was starting to feel like hockey season was in the cool, crisp air... the infamous Second Summer has returned. Alas; we’ve got a few weeks before Fall and a few weeks before the real hockey begins, so enjoy the heat while we have it. Also, enjoy this lovely look at what got Homer into the USA Hockey Hall of Fame last week. [Flyers]
*We’re continuing to work through our player reviews for last season heading into this season, and since we are toward the end we’re getting to the good bits, like Ivan Provorov. [BSH]
*Yeah, the really good bits like uh... Nicolas Aube-Kubel. The real meaty stuff, like 4th liners. [BSH]
*We’re all excited for the Flyers season to get started, but none of us is as excited as Derick Brassard. [NBC Sports Philly]
*This is not at all about the Flyers, but it’s an interesting think piece on what it means to manage expectations heading into the hockey season. [Hockey Wilderness]
*And finally, goalie masks are super cool, and the people that make them are even cooler. Taking a peek behind the curtain? The coolest. [The Athletic]</span>

Respawn pumps the brakes on plans to wipe out keyboard-and-mouse tactic
 Apex Legends developers are putting brakes on their plans to eliminate “tap-strafing,” a movement meta-tactic skilled players use to be even more mobile. The studio on Monday said it had “discovered some unexpected side effects” and is “delaying our planned change to a later patch.”
“After further testing, we’ve concluded we need to take more time to get this right to make sure related movement mechanics aren’t caught in the crossfire,” Respawn Entertainment wrote on Twitter.
On Aug. 31, Respawn said tap-strafing’s days were numbered. The move is a hard turn, executed in midair, which is commonly used by keyboard-and-mouse players on Apex Legends’ PC version. The i…</span>

But it does make for good meme fodder
 Streamers broadcasting Life is Strange: True Colors to their audiences are feeling awkward about the lack of music in the game’s streamer mode. The tool itself is designed to mute any copyrighted music that might set off DMCA takedown notices on streaming platforms like Twitch or YouTube — and it does exactly that. Some streamers were surprised to find out, however, that there’s no music to replace what’s been muted.
That makes some seems a bit awkward. Like, for instance, when True Colors star Alex Chen is singing a Radiohead song. As Alex strums away on her guitar in an emotional scene the day she’s reunited with her brother, there’s simply no sound. Alex may think she’s a creep (heh) but we can’t hear it.

Three developers reflect how to better teach Black history in games
 A cartoonish Rick Sanchez, a character from Cartoon Network’s Rick and Morty, stands outside a virtual recreation of The National Mall. In the background, a recording of Martin Luther King Jr.’s historic “I Have a Dream” speech plays. As it screens, other characters run around frantically and do dances like the floss or the robot. 
This discrepancy wasn’t hard to miss at the March Through Time event which launched inside Fortnite on Aug. 26. Event producers told Time magazine (which partnered with Fortnite creators Epic Games to put on the event) they hoped it would, “teach kids about a vital era in American history via a platform they find familiar and engaging.” But Fortnite’s cartoonish natu…</span>

Also Danny Trejo and his obligatory machete
 Far Cry 6’s post-launch content plans involve two crossover missions that jibe with the game’s setting and story, but the third — yet probably the most popular — collab sticks out like a gratuitous product placement: Players will venture into The Upside Down of Stranger Things, to save the little wiener dog you’ve seen in the preview trailers.
At least it’s free. Advertorials should be, after all. Players will also get the obligatory Danny Trejo cameo (con el machete, of course), and a Rambo mission series whose premise sounds like it kinda works? Rambo himself doesn’t drop into the game — it’s a Yaran superfan who, despite the near total cutoff of the island (vis-a-vis Cuba), has followed the 1980s action series and become obsessed with the character.


The three crossovers, coming post launch, led off a roadmap video Ubisoft posted on Friday. Players will also get, free from day one, weekly cooperative multiplayer operations — they’re “insurgencies” and “special ops.”
Of course, this is a Ubisoft joint, so there’s a season pass with premium post-launch stuff, too. As mentioned before, you’ll be going inside the minds of Pagan Min, Vaas, and Joseph Seed to learn more about how those three got so messed up. Expect a lot of surrealism, and a lot of dying, but also a lot of loot?
Far Cry 6 launches Oct. 7 for Amazon Luna, Google Stadia, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. The game was originally due in February, but was delayed as Ubisoft adjusted its COVID-19 development plans. Far Cry 6 stars Giancarlo Esposito as top bad guy Anton Castillo, and the player is Dani Rojas (not the Ted Lasso character, btw), who becomes a guerrilla army of one against the dictator.</span>

Arkane Studios once again pays homage to its lineage
 Deathloop mines a vast array of aesthetic sources, from the medieval architecture of Germany’s Northeim district, to Robin Hardy’s The Wicker Man, to the vibrant fashion of Pierre Cardin. As with all of developer Arkane’s games, it combines divergent inspirations to create a singular universe of its own. And as with all of Arkane’s releases, Deathloop wouldn’t exist were it not for a defunct, and criminally overlooked, game studio from the ’90s. And an Easter egg in its opening moments pays homage to that lineage. 
Like the protagonist of (so) many video games, Deathloop’s Colt begins with a case of amnesia. Filling the shoes of this tabula rasa, I wake up on a beach, with an empty bottl…</span>

Eight birds, one stone.
 Deathloop prides itself on intelligence, in both senses of the word. That is, “the ability to apply knowledge to manipulate one’s environment” and “information concerning an enemy or possible enemy or an area.” There is also a third layer: Intelligence in Deathloop is both diegetic and non-diegetic, as the game’s plot relies on the skills, plotting, and planning of the player character Colt, as well as the skills, plotting, and planning of the player themselves. Watching a character “be” clever is fun, but there is nothing quite like putting the final puzzle piece in yourself and watching the trap you set perform like a finely tuned watch.

The new battle pass also has a cartoon fish and a couple of new Anthropomorphic animals
 The dust has settled from Fortnite’s latest in-game event, and Chapter 2 season 8 has begun, which means there’s a new battle pass full of cosmetics to unlock. 
This time around, the highlight skin is Carnage, the notorious Spider-Man foe, and the villain of the upcoming movie Venom: Let There Be Carnage. Along with his new outfit, Carnage also gets several other cosmetics like a glider, and a trail. Perhaps his coolest feature is the Carnage harvesting tool, which just grows out of his arm thanks to his symbiote powers.

The pass also includes several other skins including Torin, the monster hunter, and J.B. Chimpanski, who is organizing the war effort against this season’s Cube threat. There’s also Fabio Sparklemane, a rainbow-themed anthropomorphic horse, and Charlotte, who gets her own katana harvesting tool. The pass also include a skin called Toona Fish that starts out black and white, but will let you add your own splashes of color later on. 
Fortnite’s latest battle pass is available now and can be purchased for 950 V-Bucks ($9.50). There’s also a free version of the battle pass which allows players to unlock certain rewards and continue to gain experience. The free version of the pass can be upgraded at anytime to the full version without losing any progress. The paid version of the pass also gives players access to all of the challenges, while the free version only offers a limited number.</span>

The return of Kevin and the Cubes
 Fortnite is heading into a new season and the Cubes have taken over the island. After the massive season 7-ending Operation: Sky Fire event, where Dr. Slone betrayed the island’s defenders, the Cubes are spreading across the island. But no one knows why. 
The arrival of this new threat on the island provides most of the mechanical changes for Fortnite Chapter 2 season 8. The new season includes changes to points of interest, new realities to explore, and augmented weapons.
One of the big new additions for season 8 is The Sideways, a new dimension that features lower gravity and various obstacles that make building a little harder. This should encourage players who are inside to always stay on the move. The Sideways also has a fe…</span>

Kuo envisions two possible scenarios for how Apple treats the ‌AirPods‌ lineup following the launch of the new model. In the first scenario, Kuo says Apple may price the third-generation ‌AirPods‌ higher than the current second-generation ‌AirPods‌, keeping the existing model in the line. 



Secondly, Apple may reduce the price of the existing ‌AirPods‌ and replace their spot in the lineup with the third-generation ‌AirPods‌ at the current $199 price point. Either way, Kuo says Apple will keep …</span>

                    <span>You’ll read nothing better — or more prescient — about 9/11 than Hunter S. Thompson’s column for ESPN, written 24 hours after the attack:
The towers are gone now, reduced to bloody rubble, along with all
hopes for Peace in Our Time, in the United States or any other
country. Make no mistake about it: We are At War now — with
somebody — and we will stay At War with that mysterious Enemy for
the rest of our lives.
It will be a Religious War, a sort of Christian Jihad, fueled by
religious hatred and led by merciless fanatics on both sides. It
will be guerrilla warfare on a global scale, with no front lines
and no identifiable enemy. Osama bin Laden may be a primitive
“figurehead” — or even dead, for all we know — but whoever put
those All-American jet planes loaded with All-American fuel into
the Twin Towers and the Pentagon did it with chilling precision
and accuracy. The second one was a dead-on bullseye. Straight into
the middle of the skyscraper.
Nothing — even George Bush’s $350 billion “Star Wars” missile
defense system — could have prevented Tuesday’s attack, and it
cost next to nothing to pull off. Fewer than 20 unarmed Suicide
soldiers from some apparently primitive country somewhere on the
other side of the world took out the World Trade Center and half
the Pentagon with three quick and costless strikes on one day. The
efficiency of it was terrifying.
We are going to punish somebody for this attack, but just who or
what will be blown to smithereens for it is hard to say. Maybe
Afghanistan, maybe Pakistan or Iraq, or possibly all three at
once. Who knows? Not even the Generals in what remains of the
Pentagon or the New York papers calling for WAR seem to know who
did it or where to look for them.
The good Dr. Thompson’s voice is sorely missed today.

Nine Favorite Things. I know I’ve said this before, but if you’re looking for a picture-perfect time to visit Colorado, it’s mid-September. I’m not going to go on and on about the weather. Suffice it to say that it has been perfect every single day this week. Warm during the day, cool and crisp mornings…

                    <span>Apple&#x27;s biggest product introduction is right around the corner, with an Apple event now officially announced for next Tuesday, September 14! We&#x27;re continuing to see a flurry of rumors about not only the iPhone 13 and Apple Watch Series 7 that we&#x27;re expecting to see at the event, but also the iPhone 14 that&#x27;s a whole year away.





The other major piece of news this week was that a decision was finally handed down in the blockbuster Epic Games v. Apple trial. It was a mixed verdict with Apple winning on nine of the ten counts but the sole Epic victory meaning that U.S. developers would be able to link to alternative payment systems in their apps. But stay tuned, because this dispute isn&#x27;t over yet.

                    <span>WhatsApp has announced it will give its two billion users the option to upload their chat backups to Apple&#x27;s iCloud using password-protected encryption.





Currently, WhatsApp on iPhone lets users back up their chat history to ‌‌iCloud‌‌, but messages and media that users back up aren&#x27;t protected by WhatsApp&#x27;s end-to-end encryption while in ‌‌Apple&#x27;s cloud servers‌.



Given that Apple holds the encryption keys for ‌iCloud‌, a subpoena of Apple or an unauthorized ‌iCloud‌ hack could potentially allow access to WhatsApp messages backed up there. Apple was reportedly pressured to not add encryption to ‌iCloud‌ Backups after the FBI complained.



The upcoming WhatsApp feature will resolve that security vulnerability by allowing users to encrypt and password-protect their chat…</span>

                    <span>Apple today published a new support document warning iPhone users that the cameras on their devices can be damaged by exposure to certain vibrational frequencies such as those generated by high-power motorcycle engines.





‌iPhone‌ camera lenses with optical image stabilization (OIS) or closed-loop autofocus (AF) are susceptible to this damage due to their use of gyroscopes and/or magnetic sensors to help compensate for movement and vibration when shooting photos or video.
The OIS and closed-loop AF systems in iPhone are designed for durability. However, as is the case with many consumer electronics that include systems like OIS, long-term direct exposure to high-amplitude vibrations within certain frequency ranges may degrade the performance of these systems and lead to reduced im…</span>

                    <span>Apoorva Mandavilli, reporting for The New York Times back on August 18:
Together, the new studies indicate overall that vaccines have an
effectiveness of roughly 55 percent against all infections, 80
percent against symptomatic infection, and 90 percent or higher
against hospitalization, noted Ellie Murray, an epidemiologist at
Boston University.
“Those numbers are actually very good,” Dr. Murray said. “The only
group that these data would suggest boosters for, to me, is the
immunocompromised.” […]
Dr. Murray said a booster shot would undoubtedly boost immunity in
an individual, but the added benefit may be minimal — and
obtained just as easily by wearing a mask, or avoiding indoor
dining and crowded bars.
This is like saying we don’t need air bags in addition to seat belts, because the eq…</span>

                    <span>Beth Mole, reporting for Ars Technica:
COVID-19 vaccines are largely holding up against the
hyper-transmissible delta coronavirus variant, particularly when
it comes to preventing severe disease and death, according to
three studies published Friday by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention. […]
In terms of infections, fully vaccinated people were about 11
times less likely to get an infection in the pre-delta period,
compared with the unvaccinated (with a 95 percent confidence
interval of 7.8 to 15.8). That ratio dropped to 4.6 less likely in
the post-delta period (with a 95 percent confidence interval of
2.5 to 8.5).
For hospitalizations prior to delta, fully vaccinated people were
13 times less likely to wind up in the hospital than the
unvaccinated (confidence interval of 11.3 to 15.6). After delta,
that ratio dropped slightly to 10 times less likely (confidence
interval of 8.1 to 13.3). The fully vaccinated were 16.6 times
less likely to die of COVID-19 prior to delta (confidence interval
of 13.5 to 20.4) and 11.3 times less likely to die after delta
(confidence interval of 9.1 to 13.9).
Donald McNeil — the award-winning science reporter formerly of The New York Times — writing a month ago:
Confusion about mask rules is now so great that enforcement
anywhere but on airplanes will be impossible. Requiring weekly
tests as a substitute for vaccination is doomed to fail because
the Delta variant can turn someone from healthy to superspreader
in less than four days.
The key to saving lives is vaccine. The key to reopening offices
and factories is vaccine. The key to reopening schools is vaccine.
The key to keeping bars and restaurants open in cold weather is
vaccine. The key to travel and shopping is vaccine. Vaccine in
everybody.

                    <span>The Texas Switch is a filmmaking technique in which an actor and stunt person are switched seamlessly during a single shot — the actor steps out of the frame or behind a prop and the stunt person steps in (or vice versa). The lack of cutting keeps the narrative going and helps to obscure the switcheroo. The video above contains many great examples. of the technique.

                    <span>Black Film Archive is a collection of links to films made by Black filmmakers &amp; actors from 1915 to 1979 that are available to stream online. Maya Cade writes about why she created this archive.
The films collected on Black Film Archive have something significant to say about the Black experience; speak to Black audiences; and/or have a Black star, writer, producer, or director. This criterion for selection is as broad and inclusive as possible, allowing the site to cover the widest range of what a Black film can be.
The films listed here should be considered in conversation with each other, as visions of Black being on film across time. They express what only film can: social, anthropological, and aesthetic looks at the changing face of Black expression (or white attitudes about Black expression, which are inescapable given the whiteness of decision-makers in the film industry). 
Films, by their very nature, require a connection between creator and audience. This relationship provides a common thread that is understood through conventional and lived knowledge to form thought and to consider. Not every filmmaker is speaking directly to Blackness or Black people or has the intention to. Some films listed carry a Black face to get their message across. But presented here, these films offer a full look into the Black experience, inferred or real, on-screen.


What a great open resource — exactly what the internet is for. You can read more about the archive on Vulture and NPR.

                    <span>Documentaries about mushrooms like Fantastic Fungi are interesting but it turns out that short documentaries about how mushroom documentaries are made are fascinating as well. For this short video, Wired talked to Louie Schwartzberg about how mushroom time lapses are filmed. I don’t know why I assumed they filmed these outside…of course they are done indoors to help control lighting, weather, and other factors (like rogue wildlife). And after decades of working on nature films, Schwartzberg has integrated his process deeply into his life:
I realized I’ve turned it into a spiritual practice. It actually literally gets me up in the morning because as soon as I’m out of bed, I’m thinking ooh, “I wonder what the flower did last night? Is it still in frame? Is it in focus?”
I have to imagine what the framing and the composition is going to look like tomorrow, or two days from now, or a week from now. That is a transformational experience because you have to put your mind into the mindset and the intention of the flower or the fungi, thinking where it’s going to grow, how big will it get. And if you’re right, boy, it’s a rush. If you’re wrong, it means you just gotta do it all over again.


This was surprisingly philosophical in parts.

                    <span>Apple is holding its annual iPhone-centric event on Tuesday, September 14, and like last year, it will be entirely digital. We&#x27;ve been hearing rumors about what&#x27;s coming for many months now, so we have a good idea of what to expect.

We&#x27;re expecting the new iPhone 13 models and Apple Watch Series 7 models to debut at the event, along with new Apple Watch bands and iPhone cases. We could also get the AirPods 3, and there are also other products on the horizon like new iPads and the M1X MacBook Pro, but with Apple rumored to be holding multiple events over the next few months, this one may have more of an iPhone focus.

                    <span>We&#x27;re not expecting new Macs to debut at Apple&#x27;s upcoming &quot;California Streaming&quot; event, but according to Bloomberg&#x27;s Mark Gurman, Apple is making one small tweak to its Mac sales plans.





After the September 14 event, Apple retail stores will begin selling the 24-inch iMac in all colors, which will mean all seven colors will be able to be purchased in store.



Right now, Apple&#x27;s retail stores only offer the ‌iMac‌ in green, pink, blue, and silver. The yellow, orange, and purple colors cannot be purchased in stores and must be ordered online.



The change will make it easier for customers who want one of the more unusual ‌iMac‌ colors to get an ‌iMac‌ right away without having to wait for shipping. It may also mean that third-party stores will be able to carry additional colors, as retailers like Best Buy have also been limited to green, pink, blue, and silver.



There are highly anticipated redesigned 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro models that are in the works, but unfortunately, we are not expecting these new machines at the September event. Instead, Apple will likely hold a second October and/or November event that will focus on Macs and iPads.

                    <span>The first season of basketball-focused TV show &quot;Swagger&quot; is set to premiere on Friday, October 29, Apple announced today.





&quot;Swagger&quot; is a drama series inspired by Brooklyn Nets superstar Kevin Durant&#x27;s childhood and his experience as a talented youth basketball player courted by recruiters.
Inspired by Durant&#x27;s experiences, &quot;Swagger&quot; explores the world of youth basketball, and the players, their families and coaches who walk the fine line between dreams and ambition, and opportunism and corruption. Off the court, the show reveals what it&#x27;s like to grow up in America.
The 10-episode series is set to star Isaiah Hill, O&#x27;Shea Jackson Jr., and Quvenzhané Wallis. Kevin Durant was involved in the show&#x27;s creation alongside Reggie Rock and Brian Grazer.



When the show premieres on October 29, the first three episodes will be available, with new episodes to follow each Friday.



In other Apple TV+ news, John Lithgow has been cast in ‌Apple TV+‌ thriller &quot;Sharper,&quot; and he will star alongside Julianne Moore. &quot;Sharper&quot; follows the story of a woman who cons her way through the world of Manhattan&#x27;s wealthy elite.



Apple has also inked a deal for popular children&#x27;s television show &quot;Yo Gabba Gabba.&quot; Apple is creating a new 20-episode &quot;Yo Gabba Gabba&quot; series and has also acquired the rights to all prior &quot;Yo Gabba Gabba&quot; TV shows and specials.

                    <span>The year-long dispute between Epic Games and Apple reached a milestone with Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers delivering a middle-of-the road verdict that isn&#x27;t quite what ‌Epic Games‌ or Apple wanted.





Apple will not be required to support third-party app stores as ‌Epic Games‌ pushed for, but Apple will have to let developers offer &quot;buttons, external links, or other calls to action&quot; to direct customers to in-app purchase alternatives.



In a statement on Twitter, ‌Epic Games‌ CEO Tim Sweeney said that the company was not happy with the verdict, and at the current time, there are no immediate plans for Fortnite to return to the App Store. Sweeney said that today&#x27;s ruling &quot;isn&#x27;t a win&quot; for developers or consumers.

                    <span>A decision was reached today in the high-profile Epic Games v. Apple trial, with U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruling that Apple&#x27;s anti-steering conduct is anti-competitive, and ruling in favor of Apple on all other counts.





In a 185-page ruling, Judge Rogers said &quot;the Court cannot ultimately conclude that Apple is a monopolist under either federal or state antitrust laws,&quot; but she said the trial &quot;did show that Apple is engaging in anticompetitive conduct under California&#x27;s competition laws.&quot; Rogers concluded that &quot;Apple&#x27;s anti-steering provisions hide critical information from consumers and illegally stifle consumer choice&quot;:
Having defined the relevant market as digital mobile gaming transactions, the Court next evaluated Apple&#x27;s conduct in that market. Given the tr…</span>

                    <span>Apple has abandoned its plans for a low-cost Apple TV dongle and is set to significantly accelerate and expand the output of new content on Apple TV+ next year, according to The Information.





Sources said to be familiar with Apple&#x27;s plans speaking to The Information have apparently revealed many of the company&#x27;s internal discussions and attitudes around ‌Apple TV+‌ in detail. The company allegedly sees ‌Apple TV+‌ as a standalone business rather than a mechanism to encourage users to buy into the Apple ecosystem. 



The Information reported in 2018 that Apple was working on a low-cost TV dongle device as a more inexpensive alternative to the ‌Apple TV‌, which starts at $149. The project was driven by Tim Twerdahl, an Apple video and audio marketing executive, who argued that…</span>

                    <span>In a research note focused on how the Apple Watch Series 7 will still be released in September despite a minor two-week delay in mass production, reputable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also briefly commented on the Apple Watch Series 8 and AirPods.





Kuo said he is optimistic about demand for the Apple Watch in 2022 given that next year&#x27;s Apple Watch Series 8 will offer new health management features, and he predicted this will include body temperature measurement. This feature would conveniently turn the Apple Watch into a thermometer on your wrist, which could be especially useful for detecting a fever, a common symptom of many illnesses.

                    <span>Apple has announced the creation of a process to properly identify and compensate individual creators involved in making DJ mixes that are streamed on Apple Music (via TechCrunch).





The process reportedly uses technology from Shazam, and Apple is working with major and independent labels to work out a system whereby streaming royalties are fairly divided among DJs, labels, and artists who feature in the mixes.



Since the rise of streaming services, the job of paying rights holders whose music is used in a DJ mix has been a lingering issue. The rise in popularity of the EDM genre has also resulted in an increasing number of remixes, mash-ups, and DJ mixes that incorporate samples from other songs, making working out who should be compensated even harder.

Apple has now officially launched those Maps improvements in Italy, San Marino, Vatican City, and Andorra, according to MacStories.





The update brings a raft of previously unavailable Maps features to the regions, including Look Around, lane guidance, speed camera data, 3D buildings, Siri Natural Language Guidance, and improved navigation. The update also adds more detailed road coverage, and faster and more accurate navigation.

                    <span>Several Apple products, including recently launched devices, are currently experiencing delayed shipping times, a possible sign that the ongoing chip shortage could be more significantly impacting Apple and its products.





During the company&#x27;s third-quarter earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook warned that the chip shortage that has plagued the industry for the last few months would impact iPhone shipments this year. While Cook was likely referencing constraints with the upcoming iPhone 13, the shortage could be creeping onto existing models.



Ahead of an expected refresh or update, the current and soon-to-be last generation devices can be expected to be depleted in stock as Apple makes room for the newer models. As a result, select configurations of the iPhone 11 and iPhone 12 …</span>

                    <span>Apple today added the 16GB fifth-generation iPod touch, released in 2013, to its list of obsolete products.





This specific variation of the ‌iPod touch‌ was released as a lower-end option to the fifth-generation ‌iPod touch‌ released a year earlier. Compared to its 32GB and 64GB companions, the 16GB model was only offered in a single silver color and lacked a rear camera or loop.



Apple followed up the fifth-generation ‌iPod touch‌ with the sixth-generation in the summer of 2015. Compared to the previous generation, the newer model featured improved performance and the removal of the wrist strap. Since the seventh-generation ‌iPod touch‌ released in 2019, Apple has not yet updated its iconic product.



Apple classifies products that have been discontinued for at least seven years as &quot;obsolete,&quot; meaning that they cannot receive any hardware service from Apple or its service providers.

The production issue of the Apple Watch 7 is mainly related to the panel side. However, it has been resolved, and mass production of panel modules will begin in mid-September.
The ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ will feature a new design with a flat-edged look that&#x27;s similar to the flat edges used for the iPhone 12 and iPad Pro.

                    <span>The past five years have been a seemingly linear rise to relevance for California-based dark pop group Provoker. After several singles and an EP, they’ve finally released a full length and it’s everything we could have hoped for. New wave for newer times gives us a warbly backdrop of syrupy guitar licks over retro, simplistic […]

                    <span>I’ve got to get straight to the point: FINAL GASP’s Haunting Whisper is the Fucking BOMB. That being said, this record worships at the altar of Samhain and honestly, I’m not mad at them at all, because I can’t stop listening to this record that’s out now on Triple B Records. Yeah, they are inspired […]

                    <span>Listening to Belgium’s avant-garde electronic two-piece Of Blood and Mercury, I can’t help but feel like I’ve entered into a sacred space. Kind of like church, but a real church, a place deeply hidden that uses sound frequencies to communicate its gospel. A place to worship the cosmos and enter into a galaxy of contemplation […]

                    <span>The photography of DAIKICHI AMANO, at first glance, seems to have some kind of bestiality connotation. The languid poses, the nudity, the open mouths—but as I look more deeply into these images, I feel like what I’m seeing is humanity in the animal world. And not the way we like to think of ourselves in […]

                    <span>Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled today on the Epic v. Apple case. It seems pretty clear to me that Apple got a huge victory, and Epic was served an even huger loss.  But read for yourself. There are three documents:
A one-page judgment, finding for Epic only on the issue of Apple’s anti-steering provision in the App Store Guidelines, and for Apple on all other counts. The judgment also says Epic owes Apple 30 percent of the $12 million Fortnite for iOS garnered while they were using their own in-app payment processing between August and October 2020, and that Epic and Apple must both pay their own legal fees.


A one-page injunction against the aforementioned anti-steering guideline, the meat of which is this:
Apple Inc. and its officers, agents, servants, employees, and any person in active concert or participation with them (“Apple”), are hereby permanently restrained and enjoined from prohibiting developers from (i) including in their apps and their metadata buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms, in addition to In-App Purchasing and (ii) communicating with customers through points of contact obtained voluntarily from customers through account registration within the app.


A 185-page ruling, containing all the findings of fact, etc.

                    <span>Paul Roberts, reporting for The Seattle Times:
In a sign of growing momentum for vaccine mandates, Microsoft has
reversed course and will now require employees to be fully
vaccinated to enter the company’s U.S. offices and other
worksites, starting next month.
The Redmond-based tech giant told employees Tuesday it will
“require proof of vaccination for all employees, vendors, and any
guests entering Microsoft buildings in the U.S.”
The company also said it will have a process to accommodate
employees “who have a medical condition or other protected reason,
such as religion, which prevent them from getting vaccinated.”
Accommodations for medical conditions that preclude being vaccinated are common sense. But fuck these “religious” exemptions. If your “religion” forbids you from being vaccinated, that’s not a religion, that’s a cult.
So where’s Apple on this? Why isn’t Apple requiring proof of vaccination for employees, including for retail employees and customers? Why reserve courageous decisions only for removing headphone jacks?

This year, the mayor’s seat is wide open, after incumbent mayor Steve Schewel declined to run for re-election to a third term. Wards I, II, and III also feature races, with incumbent council members seeking re-election in Wards I and II. A primary election for mayor and seats for Wards I and II take place October 5, with the top two vote getters in each race advancing to the general election on November 2. Early voting in Durham’s municipal primary begins next week for these three seats, and we will make endorsements in all three races. The Ward III seat drew only two candidates, so they will automatically advance to the general election ballot. We will not endorse in this race as candidate AJ Williams is the son of our staff writer, Thomasi McDonald, who covers Durham. Read questionnaires from some of the candidates below and check back this Wednesday for our endorsements!</span>

                    <span>Hello! I was talking to a friend yesterday who was studying for a programming
interview and trying to learn some algorithms basics.
The topic of quadratic-time vs linear-time algorithms came up, I thought this
would be fun to write about here because avoiding quadratic-time algorithms
isn’t just important in interviews – it’s sometimes good to know about in real
life too! I’ll explain what a “quadratic-time algorithm is” in a minute :)
here are the 3 things we’ll talk about:
quadratic time functions are WAY WAY WAY slower than linear time functions
sometimes you can make a quadratic algorithm into a linear algorithm by using a hashmap
this is because hashmaps lookups are very fast (instant!)
I’m going to try to keep the math jargon to a minimum and focus on real code
examples and how fast/…</span>

After a fantastic 2019-20 season, Provorov was... fine.
 Ivan Provorov has long been hailed as the crown jewel of Ron Hextall’s rebuild. A defensive prospect billed as the guy who could finally give the Philadelphia Flyers a long-sought replacement for Chris Pronger in the No. 1 defenseman spot, much of the hype for the team’s future rested on his shoulders as he progressed. After a trio of uneven seasons (a promising breakout in 2017-18, horrible regression in 2018-19, and return to form in 2019-20 alongside Matt Niskanen), many considered 2020-21 to be the year that Provorov would finally insert himself into the conversation surrounding the NHL’s best young defenders. Instead, the 24-year-old stagnated, playing like an okay second pair guy ins…</span>

NAKGB? More like NAKG-Bad.
 The Flyers entered the 2020-21 season with a lot of their possible success dependent on the growth of young players. Taking a look at the roster heading into the year, it wasn’t hard to pick out Nicolas Aubé-Kubel as an underrated, yet critical bottom six presence who could elevate his fellow forwards via his combination of relentless forechecking, subtle contributions in transition, and above-average scoring touch. Given the unabashed praise NAK earned from all sides following an excellent debut as an NHL regular (yes, I know Dave Hakstol played him for five minutes in a game the year prior), these expectations weren’t exactly lofty; there was a body of work to base them off of. Instead of meeting or even slightly underac…</span>

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *Big news for Paul Holmgren yesterday as he was named to the United States Hockey Hall of Fame, which is pretty neat and, given all he’s done for the franchise, very well deserved. [Flyers]
*Yesterday we read that Kim Dillabaugh has a lot of faith in Martin Jones, and today we are reading that so does the Flyers’ newest front office member Mike O’Connell. Laying it on thick, boys! [NBC Sports Philly]
*While the whole dang team desperately needs a “bounce-back” year after last season’s mess, these five players are really going to need to turn it around if the Flyers are going to turn it around. [BSH]
*Travis Konecny is one of those guys and he is already hard at work at the Flyers’ practice facility, determined to get back to what we expect of him. [Flyers]
*Part two of Charlie’s interview with Brent Flahr focuses on the Flyers’ prospects at defense and goaltending, at least one of whom will be seriously competing for a roster spot at camp in a few weeks. [The Athletic]
*And finally, just in time for your weekend, a brand new episode of Flyperbole! The Flyers’ Hall of Fame nominees make for a fun conversation; please to enjoy. [BSH]</span>

Then baked and dipped in a sweet brown butter glaze flavored with coffee and cinnamon. There’s really nothing not to love about these cute (and sweet) autumn spiced doughnuts. The true secret?

Let me love you, citizens
 No Man’s Sky’s new Frontiers update adds a fun new element to the game: the chance to discover struggling little towns and give them the civic guidance they desperately need. Released in early September with the 3.6 patch, Frontiers doesn’t radically transform the space exploration game, but it adds a nice layer of texture to your usual rounds of exploring planets, completing quests, and fighting Sentinels. There’s just one problem: I want to be friends with my townsfolk, and No Man’s Sky can’t quite let me do that.
When I show up in my new frontier town of Sporeholm, the Vy’keen aliens will wave at me and give me a couple of lines of dialogue where they thank me for my service or complain about Sentinel robots attacking them. I can se…</span>

Operation: Sky Fire is the end of Fortnite Chapter 2 Season 7
 Fortnite’s latest season is coming to an explosive end on Sunday in a massive plot to stop the ongoing alien invasion. To finally destroy the alien threat, developer Epic Games is releasing a new season-ending event that will have players infiltrate The Last Reality and save the world. The event will begin at 4 p.m. EDT on Sunday, Sept. 12. 
The final event of Fortnite Chapter 2 season 7 will be called Operation: Sky Fire and will be a one-time event that all players can participate in, similar to previous events. Unlike some events, however, there will be no replays available for Operation: Sky Fire. The event will take place in its own separate playlist which will go live 30 minutes before the event is set to begin — which is probably when you’ll want to be online, based on the server queues that have happened in the past. 
This new event also comes with a few unique warnings from Epic. According to the developer’s post on the Fortnite website, players should make sure that all of their challenges are completed before the event begins, and that all of their Battle Stars have been redeemed — otherwise they’ll automatically be redeemed, starting with the earliest available unlocks. Players will also need to complete all of their Superman quests before the event if they want to unlock all of his cosmetic goodies. 
Fortnite Chapter 2 season 8 is set to begin sometime after Operation: Sky Fire, but just how soon after, and what happens next, are things we’ll have to find out after the event.</span>

Rest easy, cat fans
 Square Enix gave us our first good look at Forspoken’s story and gameplay during Sony’s PlayStation Showcase on Thursday, showing the brand-new fantasy world being developed by the Final Fantasy 15 team at Luminous Productions. But it was Homer, beloved cat of protagonist Frey, that stole the hearts of viewers. The problem came when fans started wondering, “What’s going to happen to Homer while Frey is out kicking ass the entire game?”
On Twitter and YouTube, fans seemed excited about Forspoken, but concerned about Homer. “What happens to the cat?!?!” they asked. “I need closure for Homer...” one fan pleaded. “I 100% agree with everyone else, I can’t handle the guilt of letting my cat starve to death in my apartment while I play with dragons,” worried another.
But a new tweet from the Forspoken Twitter account has soothed fans.
This is a Homer appreciation post.  
P.S. Promise she&#x27;s OK. pic.twitter.com/wyFXQ0Ue6p

Homer, the talkative Balinese house cat with big blue eyes, will not be starving to death during your journey as Frey, it seems. While assurances are certainly appreciated for those of us with animal anxiety, it’s still not clear what Homer will be up to. Will she adventure alongside Frey as some of the YouTube comments suggest? Or will Homer get to relax at home with a cat sitter? The answer we’re hoping for is probably quite different than the one Homer would want.
Forspoken is a third-person action game in which Frey enters a mysterious world called Athia and wields a magic bracelet to battle dragons with magic. Forspoken doesn’t have a release date yet, but Square Enix and Luminous Productions will release it for PlayStation 5 and Windows PC sometime in the spring of 2022.</span>

Head to the EDZ for some Exotics
 The weekly Exotic item merchant, Xur, hangs out in random locations around the world of Destiny. In Destiny 2, he can appear all over the map, as well as inside the Tower. This week, you can find Xur in the EDZ, in the Winding Cove, standing on a bluff next to a Fallen Ketch.

Apple loses on a key point of the Fortnite trial
 Apple must stop blocking App Store developers from steering their users to third-party payment options, a federal judge ruled Friday, issuing a permanent injunction in the Epic Games v. Apple lawsuit. 
The injunction is a significant victory for Fortnite maker Epic Games and other developers who have found the App Store’s terms — including the 30% cut of sales that Apple takes — onerous and unmerited. But Apple also claimed victory, in that it prevailed on all other counts, including against Epic’s allegation that Apple’s policies around in-app purchases constituted an illegal monopoly in the payment market f…</span>

The rumors are true. All of them. 
 I’m a fashion mogul, a state representative, and a very important person. I’m standing by the window of my office, staring out at the skyline of Los Santos and smoking a cigarette. My friend Jericho Delmonta ushers a notorious group of ruffians to sit down on my white leather couch. These are the Broker Boys, some of the most violent criminals in all of San Andreas, and I am about to hire them to put my enemies in the river for a series of deeply petty reasons. 
Let’s start from the beginning. I’m a player on the New Day role-play server for Grand Theft Auto Online, which offers a much more realistic and grounded look at the criminals-versus-cop fantasy of the franchise. This is a server where you have to b…</span>

                    <span>Because of humans, most of the world’s oyster reefs have disappeared over the last 200 years. Now, some groups around the world are trying to put some of them back. In addition to providing water filtration and habitats for other animals, offshore oyster reefs can help slow long-term erosion by acting as living breakwater structures that partially deflect waves during storm surges.
In the last century, 85% of the world’s oyster reefs have vanished. And we’re only recently beginning to understand what that’s cost us: While they don’t look incredibly appealing from the shore, oysters are vital to bays and waterways around the world. A single oyster can filter up to 50 gallons of water every day. And over time, oysters form incredible reef structures that double as habitats for various species of fish, crabs, and other animals. In their absence, our coastlines have suffered.
Now, several projects from New York to the Gulf of Mexico and Bangladesh are aiming to bring the oysters back. Because not only are oysters vital ecosystems; they can also protect us from the rising oceans by acting as breakwaters, deflecting waves before they hit the shore. It won’t stop the seas from rising — but embracing living shorelines could help protect us from what’s to come.

                    <span>As his name suggests, Jamaican street musician Brushy One String plays a one-string guitar and, under that constraint, makes some truly beautiful music. Josh Jones wrote about Brushy for Open Culture:
When Jamaican musician Andrew Chin, better known as Brushy One String first told friends about his vision — “a dream in which he was told to play the one-string guitar” — they responded with mockery — all but one, who “insisted it was fate,” writes Playing for Change, “and that he had to make that dream come true.” So Brushy set out to do just that, playing on street corners and in the market, “in a big broad hat and sunglasses,” he says. The music came to him naturally. He is no ordinary street musician, however, and his one-string guitar is not a gimmick. Brushy is a talented singer-songwriter, with a powerful voice and a musical sensibility that transcends his bare-bones minimalism.


In addition to his NPR Tiny Desk Concert above, this video of Brushy performing Chicken in The Corn on his one-string has been viewed over 50 million times.

                    <span>Apple VP of technology Kevin Lynch is taking over the Apple Car project and will be replacing Doug Field, who is moving to Ford, reports Bloomberg.





Lynch first joined the Apple Car team in July, with reports suggesting he had been called on to help lead ‌Apple Car‌ development. Now that Field has left the company, Lynch will be taking over his role and will be in charge of the ‌Apple Car‌. Lynch will oversee hardware engineering and work on self-driving car sensors.



Known for his work on the Apple Watch, Lynch has been at Apple since 2013, and before that, he worked at Adobe and helped create Adobe&#x27;s Creative Cloud platform. In addition to working on the ‌Apple Car‌, Lynch is expected to continue to be involved with the Apple Watch and Apple&#x27;s health initiatives.

                    <span>Facebook today launched its first smart glasses, which were created in collaboration with Ray-Ban. The Ray-Ban Stories are priced starting at $299 and come in 20 style combinations.





Smart glasses might suggest augmented reality capabilities, but Facebook&#x27;s Ray-Ban Stories are similar to other connected sunglasses on the market and are limited to making phone calls, snapping photos, and listening to music.



The Ray-Ban Stories are equipped with a set of 5-megapixel cameras built into each side of the frame, which can record photos and 30-second videos using a button or hands-free with the Facebook Assistant.



There&#x27;s a hard-wired LED light that comes on whenever you&#x27;re taking a photo or a video so other people aren&#x27;t caught unaware.

                    <span>Apple offers a bug bounty program that&#x27;s designed to pay security researchers for discovering and reporting critical bugs in Apple operating systems, but researchers are not happy with how it operates or Apple&#x27;s payouts in comparison to other major tech companies, reports The Washington Post.





In interviews with more than two dozen security researchers, The Washington Post collected a number of complaints. Apple is slow to fix bugs, and doesn&#x27;t always pay out what&#x27;s owed.



Apple in 2020 paid out $3.7 million, about half of the $6.7 million that Google paid to researchers, and far less than the $13.6 million Microsoft paid. While other companies like Facebook, Microsoft, and Google highlight security researchers that find major bugs and hold conferences and provide resources…</span>

                    <span>VMware Fusion is now available as a private tech preview for M1 Macs, with users able to request access through an online form. A public tech preview will follow in around two weeks, according to a tweet from VMware Fusion manager Michael Roy.





VMware Fusion for M1 Macs will be quite limited in scope, with a focus on virtualizing Arm-based Linux distributions. VMware Fusion will not officially support Windows 10 on M1 Macs at launch, as Microsoft has yet to offer licensing for the Arm version of Windows 10. In a tweet, Roy said Windows 10 should still run when selecting the &quot;other&quot; operating system type, but VMware will not be shipping drivers or VMware Tools.

In line with a previous report from Reuters, the report explains that the company has had its own automobile hardware research and development unit since 2014, but due to development challenges, it contacted BMW, Hyundai, Nissan, and Toyota to explore joint development and contract production agreements.



During this period, its own department for vehicle hardware research and development is believed to have virtually stopped operating around 2016. Separately, software research on self-driving continued.

A flat £2 daily charge when roaming within an EU country will apply to customers who are new or upgrading from October 1. The changes will not come into effect until May 23 2022.



The operator joins EE and Vodafone who have recently announced the return of roaming charges. O2 will continue to offer free roaming across the EU and in the United States, but only on some &quot;Plus Plans&quot; as an extra add-on.



Before the U.K. formally exited the European Union, mobile customers generally didn&#x27;t have to worry about roaming charges when using their phone in the EU, with most phone tariffs counting calls, texts, and data used in EU countries as equivalent to domestic use since 2017.



However, when the EU trade deal was signed in December 2020, mobile operators were once again able to charge customers when traveling in Europe with &quot;transparent and reasonable rates.&quot;



Originally, EE, O2, Three, and Vodafone, representing the largest mobile operators in the U.K., stated they had no plans to reintroduce roaming charges after Brexit, but all have since announced changes, some under a &quot;fair use&quot; clause.

                    <span>WarnerMedia&#x27;s HBO Max is coming to Europe next month, the streaming service has announced. Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Spain, and Andorra will be the first to get access from October 26. 





Next year, another wave of territories will be added to that list: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Slovenia.



Additional territory launches are also planned for next year, but there are currently no plans to launch HBO Max in France, Italy, Germany, and the U.K. This is said to be partly due to WarnerMedia having deals in place with other partners in these countries, where HBO programming is available on services such as Sky Atlantic and Now TV.



HBO Max was officially launched in the U.S. in May 2020, and has since expanded to 39 territories in Latin America and the Caribbean. Like those regions, the above European countries will gain access to content from HBO, Warner Bros., DC, and Cartoon Network.

&quot;This is a historic moment as HBO Max lands in Europe,&quot; said Johannes Larcher, Head of HBO Max International. &quot;WarnerMedia movies and series like Harry Potter, Game of Thrones and The Big Bang Theory are passionately consumed by fans all across Europe, and HBO Max has been created to provide them with the most intuitive and convenient viewing experience to watch these and a diverse range of other amazing titles.&quot;
HBO has yet to say what the cost of the streaming service will be in Europe, but it will make that announcement in a virtual launch scheduled for October.

                    <span>Zeke Miller, reporting for the Associated Press:
In his most forceful pandemic actions and words, President Joe
Biden on Thursday announced sweeping new federal vaccine
requirements affecting as many as 100 million Americans in an
all-out effort to increase COVID-19 vaccinations and curb the
surging delta variant.
Speaking at the White House, Biden sharply criticized the roughly
80 million Americans who are not yet vaccinated, despite months of
availability and incentives.
“We’ve been patient. But our patience is wearing thin, and your
refusal has cost all of us,” he said, all but biting off his
words. The unvaccinated minority “can cause a lot of damage, and
they are.”
More like this, please. Mandate COVID-19 vaccinations for everything. For getting on a flight, for going to school, for eating in a restaurant, for keeping your job. Yes, mandating anything is an extraordinary use of authority, but this pandemic is clearly the most extraordinary crisis most of us have ever lived through. It’s exactly why the federal government has the far more extraordinary power to draft men into the armed services and send them to war: for the greater good.

                    <span>Dana Goldstein, reporting for The New York Times:
Los Angeles is the first major school district in the United
States to mandate coronavirus vaccines for students 12 and older
who are attending class in person.
With the Delta variant ripping across the country, the district’s
Board of Education voted, 6-0, to pass the measure on Thursday
afternoon. The Los Angeles Unified School District is the second
largest in the nation, and the mandate would eventually apply to
more than 460,000 students, including some enrolled at independent
charter schools located in district buildings.
More like this, please.

                    <span>Mark Gurman, reporting for Bloomberg:*
Lynch, an Adobe Inc. veteran who joined Apple in 2013 to run the
software group for the company’s smartwatch and health efforts,
replaced Doug Field as the manager in charge of the car work,
according to people with knowledge of the matter.
The executive first started working on the project earlier this
year when he took over teams handling the underlying software. Now
he is overseeing the whole group, which also includes hardware
engineering and work on self-driving car sensors, said the people,
who asked not to be identified because the move isn’t public.
I think it’s fair to say that Lynch is second only to Craig Federighi software-wise at Apple, and the two initiatives he’s led in the eight years he’s been at Apple — WatchOS and Health — have been…</span>

                    <span>From the city’s website:
Philadelphians use almost 1 billion plastic bags each year, which
litter our streets, waterways, and commercial corridors. Plastic
bags account for over 10,000 hours of lost staff time and pose a
danger to workers at recycling facilities because they get caught
in the equipment. Banning plastic bags will make our city cleaner,
reduce waste and save money.
I’ve been reading Millions, Billions, Zillions by Brian Kernighan (who is apparently a computer scientist of some renown). It’s a great book ($11 in hardcover from Amazon; BookShop.org link to indie booksellers), and Kernighan’s writing style is as buttery smooth as ever. One of the things he does is encourage back-of-the-envelope math on numbers like the above, when you encounter them. Does it make sense that Philadelphians use 1 billion plastic bags per year?
Philly has about 1.6 million residents. 1 billion divided by 1.6 million is 625 plastic bags per person per year, about 12 bags per person per week, or 1.7 bags per person per day. When I consider how often stores double-bag anything vaguely heavy, that seems plausible. (There’s also the fact that Philly gets many tourists, and in normal times there are many non-residents who commute into the city daily for work. Feel free to bump 1.6 million to a higher number, but for ballpark “does this figure make sense” purposes, I think the Census figure is fine.)
10,000 annual hours of lost staff time is high, but seems plausible too: That’s about 192 hours per week, or about 5 full-time employees.

                    <span>Speaking of stuff you can buy from Amazon — with affiliate links that could make me rich — I highly recommend Anker’s small 20-watt Nano chargers. Basically, they’re the size of Apple’s classic 5-watt chargers, and thus fit almost anywhere, but they charge at the same speed as Apple’s much-larger new 20-watt chargers. These new models from Anker come in four colors: white, black, lavender, and sissy blue. If you or anyone you know is getting a new iPhone soon, I would strongly recommend one of Anker’s chargers over Apple’s — same speed, same price, much smaller, and a few color options to top it off.
Another Anker charger I’ve been meaning to recommend is the Atom PowerPort III Slim. It’s a 30-watt charger currently on sale for $19, and what makes it different is that it’s, well, very slim (including folding prongs). This charger will fit behind furniture that’s pushed up against the wall. It’s small and lightweight too — here’s mine next to a matchbox for comparison.

                    <span>Karl Bode, writing for TechDirt:
While streaming providers and hardware companies see
significantly higher consumer satisfaction rates that
traditional cable TV, their privacy practices still leave
something to be desired. That’s according to a new breakdown of
streaming service privacy policies by Common Sense Media,
which doled out terrible grades to pretty much everybody not
named Apple:
Our privacy evaluations of the top 10 streaming apps indicate
that all streaming apps (except Apple TV+) have privacy
practices that put consumers’ privacy at considerable risk
including selling data, sending third‐party marketing
communications, displaying targeted advertisements, tracking
users across other sites and services, and creating advertising
profiles for data brokers.
This privacy report focuses on streaming services, not hardware platforms, but related to the previous post re: Amazon’s new Fire TV Omni Series, it’s also the case that Apple TV is the only platform that makes privacy a priority and doesn’t put ads on your screen.

We’ve looked at Flyers ready to breakout, but now it’s time to turn to those looking to bounce back this season.
 The Flyers missed the playoffs in 2020-21 for a myriad of reasons, but perhaps one of the biggest — aside from league-worst goaltending — was that the roster was littered with players who left much to be desired on the ice in terms of production.
Those who didn’t quite live up to the billing fall squarely in the bounce back category. These players, combined with those expected to breakout, should give the Flyers the extra juice needed to get over the hump in a crowded division and back into the Stanley Cup playoffs. 


But enough chatter, let’s dive into five Flyers poised for bounce back seasons in 2021-22 — starting with ar…</span>

 *Big thanks to everyone who voted in our 25-Under-25 poll this week. The results are in and we’ll be revealing the rankings in the coming weeks. One top player who graduated from the 25U25 this year is Travis Sanheim, and he’s a complicated player. [BSH]
*Sticking with prospects here, Charlie’s series on the Flyers’ current crop of prospects continues with part one of his interview with Brent Flahr, who filled us in on how the forwards are progressing. [The Athletic]
*Last season’s reviews roll on, this time we’ve got Samuel Morin. [BSH]
*Our pals over at Fear The Fin took a stab at previewing the upcoming season for the Flyers, with some insight into what we can expect from new backup goalie Martin Jones. [Fear The Fin]
*Speaking of, the Flyers’ goalie coach is extremely confident that Jones is going to turn things around here in Philly. [Inquirer]
*The Metro Division will be without one of its best players to start the season. Which is great for the Flyers. [Pensburgh]
*There are still a number of very talented RFAs without contracts right now. After the whole offer sheet thing the other day you would think there’d be some movement. Not yet! [ProHockeyTalk]
*And finally, a lot of attention is paid to the NHL’s probably-unbreakable records. With good reason! They are pretty amazing, usually! But what about the records that CAN be broken? And probably will be soon? DGBs got you. [The Athletic]</span>

The top 10 announcements and reveals from Thursday’s 40-minute stream
 Sony’s PlayStation Showcase of the newest, biggest games coming to the PlayStation 5 was quite the flex. The 40-minute look at the console’s first- and third-party titles on the way this year and next (and later) provided trailers and announcements for 15 different games.
Polygon’s StoryStream has all of the coverage of Thursday’s PlayStation Showcase 2021, but if you just need the watercooler highlights heading into the weekend, here’s a digest of the top nine:

Boop that sweet doggy nose on Oct. 26
 Eidos-Montréal’s Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is slated for a release date on Oct. 26, but ahead of that date, the developer showed off more of the game during Sony’s PlayStation Showcase 2021.
The new footage showed off a group of heroes that (still) have bad ideas — but good intentions! More importantly, there’s a golden retriever wearing a space suit that talks. Forget about petting dogs. Talking dogs are the future, and the future is now.
Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy was first officially revealed earlier this year at the all-virtual E3 event, but the existence of the game was leaked years earlier. At E3, Eidos-Montréal showcased the single-player, third-person adventure game that lets players take on the role of Star-Lord in a game that’s not a movie adaptation. It’s Eidos-Montréal’s new take on the franchise, with influence coming from existing lore. Though players will operate as Star-Lord, they’ll also be able to lead a team of other Guardians, like Rocket, Groot, Gamora, and Drax. Other familiar characters (and less familiar ones, like Lady Hellbender) will show up, too.
Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.</span>

Borderland’s fantasy-first shooter got a new trailer
 Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands, a Borderlands spinoff, got a new trailer at Sony’s PlayStation Showcase on Thursday. Players got their first look at the fantasy-focused shooter, which looks like Borderlands in a more whimsical setting. Gearbox will release Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X on March 25, 2022.
In addition to the series’ usual, wacky guns, players will also get their hands on crossbows, spell, and melee weapons — albeit with their own Borderlands twist.
Gearbox originally announced Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands at the Summer Games Fest kickoff stream earlier this year. The game will star Ashly Burch in the titular role — which she originally held back in Borderlands 2. Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands will also have an all-star supporting cast, with Andy Samberg as Captain Valentine, Wanda Sykes as Frette the robot, and Will Arnett as the evil Dragon Lord.
Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands will also feature a new character customization system, which will allow players to create a wholly unique protagonist that can fit into multiple class identities. According to Gearbox founder Randy Pitchford, the game has been in and out of development for over 10 years.</span>

Most people missed this key bit of Matrix lore
 The first trailer for The Matrix Resurrections, the first new installment in the dystopian sci-fi action franchise in over 12 years, sent the internet buzzing like an angry swarm of killer Sentinels. Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss return for the four-quel as Neo and Trinity, respectively, along with original trilogy supporting players Jada Pinkett Smith and Lambert Wilson and newcomers like Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and Neil Patrick Harris. But of all the new and old faces seen in the first look at the upcoming film, one iconic character is conspicuously absent: Laurence Fishburne’s Morpheus.
We’ve known since the initial cast announcements dating back as far as 2019 that Fishburne, responsible for playing…</span>

Sloclap follows up Absolver with a night of vengeance
 The action in Sifu is a glorious homage to the best of kung fu filmmaking. The blocks, strikes, parries, and throws all look choreographed, with no wasted motion, no spammed punches winging at the air. If the hero knocks out a foe partway through her (or his) combo, they’ll simply continue the next two or three motions on the next stooge nearby, before backflipping over a table or scrambling up a wall to higher ground.
What is most intriguing to me about Sifu, from Absolver developer Sloclap, is the questions it will ask of the player and of the character they inhabit. They’re the kind of big, philosophical questions that martial arts movies aspire to sincerely present, but rarely answer. Sifu, as a piece of mar…</span>

                    <span>I keep tabs on a few trusted film school-ish YouTube channels and while I like when they cover films I’ve seen or those directed by my favorite directors, it’s more valuable when they introduce me to something new. Evan Puschak’s Nerdwriter is a particular favorite guiding light and in his latest video, he talks about Agnès Varda’s Cléo from 5 to 7, a film I now want to watch as soon as possible. A synopsis via Wikipedia:
Cléo from 5 to 7 follows a pop singer through two extraordinary hours in which she awaits the results of a recent biopsy. The film is superficially about a woman coming to terms with her mortality, which is a common auteurist trait for Varda. On a deeper level, Cléo from 5 to 7 confronts the traditionally objectified woman by giving Cléo her own vision. She cannot be constructed through the gaze of others, which is often represented through a motif of reflections and Cléo’s ability to strip her body of “to-be-looked-at-ness” attributes (such as clothing or wigs). Stylistically, Cléo from 5 to 7 mixes documentary and fiction, as had La Pointe Courte. The film represents diegetic action said to occur between 5 and 7 p.m., although its run-time is 89 minutes.


I’ve added Cléo from 5 to 7 to my HBO Max queue but you can also find it on Kanopy (accessible with a library card) and The Criterion Channel.

                    <span>In one of their most popular videos in awhile, kottke.org favorite Kurzgesagt tells us about something I’d never heard of before: giruses. These giant viruses have only been discovered within the last 20 years and are so large and contain so much genetic material that maybe they are actually alive?
Hidden in the microverse all around you, there is a merciless war being fought by the true rulers of this planet, microorganisms. Amoebae, protists, bacteria, archaea and fungi compete for resources and space. And then there are the strange horrors that are viruses, hunting everyone else. Not even being alive, they are the tiniest, most abundant and deadliest beings on earth, killing trillions every day. Not interested in resources, only in living things to take over. Or so we thought. 
It turns out that there are giant viruses that blur the line between life and death — and other viruses hunting them.

                    <span>Peter Gorman of Barely Maps has published a wonderful little book called Kaleidoscope Brain that contains 100 visualizations of Moby-Dick. Gorman read Herman Melville’s masterpiece last year and made these maps &amp; graphics to help him make sense of it.
I read Moby-Dick in April 2020. For weeks afterward, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I started making maps and diagrams as a way to figure it out.
Moby-Dick is infamous for its digressions. Throughout the book, the narrator disrupts the plot with contemplations, calculations, and categorizations. He ruminates on the White Whale, and the ocean, and human psychology, and the night sky, and how it all relates back to the mystery of the unknown. His narration feels like a twisting-turning struggle to explain everything.
Reading Moby-Dick actually made me feel like that-like I’d mentally absorbed its spin-cycle style. I developed a case of “Kaleidoscope Brain.” The maps I was making were obsessive and encyclopedic. They were newer and weirder and they digressed beyond straightforward geography.


The book is available as a free download on Gorman’s Patreon — support his efforts if you find them valuable!

                    <span>In this short video, YouTuber Paul E.T. shows how you can make a Netflix-style true crime documentary about anything. Even stolen toast. The equipment needs are pretty minimal - a good camera, a couple of lenses, some lighting, and a decent mic. The magic is in the editing.

                    <span>We&#x27;re still a week away from the launch of the iPhone 13, but rumors about the next-generation iPhone 14 models are already circulating and have picked up this week.





We&#x27;ve been hearing about a no-notch hole-punch display design since March, which was reiterated this morning by leaker Jon Prosser. Apple is expected to ditch the notch in favor of a hole-punch camera, and to facilitate that design, display analyst Ross Young says that Apple is also working on an under-display Face ID feature.



Young first shared his predictions for under-display Face ID in June, but highlighted them again today following the earlier ‌iPhone‌ 14 leaks. According to Young, Apple is working on under-display Face ID for the ‌iPhone‌ 14 Pro and Pro Max models.

                    <span>Twitter today announced the launch of a new &quot;Communities&quot; feature that&#x27;s meant to take on Facebook&#x27;s popular Groups by providing a space where people can share discussions on a specific topic.





An invite-only feature at the current time, Communities are created by Twitter users and are self-moderated. Community creators who are invited by Twitter to participate can invite an unlimited number of users to their group.



Members of a Community will see a new option to choose an audience in the tweet composer, allowing them to tweet to all of their followers or just to those followers who participate in the Community.




Communities are invite-only (also for now!) but admins and moderators have unlimited invites and members have 5 invites per Community (again, for now!) that are sent via DM
so choose wisely (3/7) pic.twitter.com/KTDnmhOB8T
— Twitter Communities (@JoinCommunities) September 8, 2021
 


Tweets shared to a Community will show up in the Community and in the timelines of other members of the group. Communities are not private and can be viewed by others on Twitter, but only members can participate.



On iOS devices, Communities can be accessed through the navigation bar, and on the web, there&#x27;s a Communities option on the sidebar.



Starting today, there are a handful of Communities available such as #DogTwitter and #SkinCareTwitter, but Twitter is planning for more to be created each week and those interested in starting a Community can apply on the Twitter website.

                    <span>While we&#x27;re likely just six days away from Apple unveiling the iPhone 13 lineup at its confirmed September 14 event, leaker Jon Prosser has shared alleged details about next year&#x27;s iPhone 14 on his Front Page Tech website.





Key features of the iPhone 14 based on Prosser&#x27;s renders, which were created by Ian Zelbo:
No notch, with a hole-punch front camera instead, in line with information shared by analyst Ming-Chi Kuo


A thicker chassis allowing for no rear camera bump, with the lenses, LED flash, and LiDAR Scanner sitting flush with the rear glass


A titanium frame


Round volume buttons that look similar to those on older iPhone 4 and iPhone 5 models


Redesigned speaker and microphone grilles with elongated mesh cutouts instead of individual holes on the bottom of the device


Lightning connector remains on at least some iPhone 14 models
Prosser provided a closer look at the iPhone 14 renders on his YouTube channel:



Prosser said that while some aspects of the iPhone 14&#x27;s design and dimensions could change between now and the device&#x27;s likely release in September 2022, he is confident that the overall design will remain largely the same when mass production begins.



Prosser was recently accurate about Apple launching a colorful new iMac, and he revealed the design of the AirTag prior to its release, but he has been wrong about the launch timing and pricing of some other Apple products.

                    <span>As a result of legal and regulatory pressures, Apple recently announced some upcoming changes to its App Store policies, such as letting developers email customers about payment options available outside of their iOS app and allowing &quot;reader&quot; apps like Spotify and Netflix to include an in-app link to their website for account signup.





Apple said the changes &quot;will help make the App Store an even better business opportunity for developers,&quot; but Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty believes there will be &quot;minimal financial impact&quot; to Apple. In a research note, she said the changes would result in just a 1-2% hit to Apple&#x27;s earnings per share in the 2022 fiscal year in a worst case scenario.



For example, while &quot;reader&quot; apps will be able to provide a single link to their website…</span>

Weinbach&#x27;s most notable ‌iPhone 13‌ rumors from his latest tweets are listed below:



No price rises for the ‌iPhone 13‌ lineup.


The ‌iPhone 13‌ mini will offer approximately one additional hour of battery life.


The ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro Max will feature an 18 to 20 percent larger battery compared to the iPhone 12 Pro Max.


Both the ‌iPhone 13‌ and ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro will continue to use the same battery components as last year, but offer batteries that are 10 percent larger.


The battery life of the ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro may be worse than the ‌iPhone 13‌ due to the power consumption of the…</span>

                    <span>Amazon today has Apple&#x27;s MagSafe Charger for $29.98, down from $39.00. This sale is just a couple of cents off from the lowest price we&#x27;ve ever seen on this accessory, and it&#x27;s one of the best prices available online this week. It&#x27;s also being matched at Walmart.



Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.



The MagSafe Charger perfectly aligns with the magnets on the iPhone 12 family of devices and provides wireless charging. It also maintains compatibility with Qi charging, so any iPhone 8 or later device can still use it, as well as AirPods with a Wireless Charging Case and AirPods Pro.




$9 OFF
MagSafe Charger for $29.98





For optimal charging, Apple recommends using a 20W USB-C Power Adapter with the MagSafe Charger, but it&#x27;s sold separately. However, Costco members this week can save on both of these accessories when bundled together, priced at $39.99. Individually, the 20W USB-C Power Adapter costs $19.00 and the MagSafe Charger costs $39.00, so you&#x27;re essentially getting the Power Adapter at no extra cost with this deal.



Of course, you&#x27;ll need to be a Costco member to see the deal and be able to purchase it. You&#x27;ll have until September 10 before the sale ends, and there is a limit of two per member. Head to our full Deals Roundup to get caught up with all of the latest deals and discounts that we&#x27;ve been tracking over the past week.

                    <span>Dutch bank de Volksbank has said it is bringing Apple Pay support to all its customers soon, including those of its subsidiary banks, reports iCulture.





De Volksbank is the parent company of SNS, ASN Bank, and RegioBank, all of which operate in the Netherlands. &quot;‌Apple Pay‌ will be made possible for the customers of SNS, ASN Bank and RegioBank,&quot; a De Volksbank spokesperson told iCulture, adding &quot;We can&#x27;t share anything about timing at the moment.&quot;



Over a year and a half ago, SNS Bank indicated that it was in talks with Apple about offering support for ‌Apple Pay‌, but then the bank went silent on the matter. Today&#x27;s development suggests those talks are finally coming to fruition.



‌Apple Pay‌ officially went live in The Netherlands in 2019, with ING leading the charge to bring Apple&#x27;s digital payment system to debit and credit card users in the country.



Since then, other banks including Bunq, Monese, N26, Revolut, ABN AMRO, and Rabobank have all brought Apple Pay support to customers in The Netherlands, which suggested de Volksbank and its parent banks were being left behind. 



According to Apple&#x27;s regional ‌‌Apple Pay‌‌ web page, ‌‌Apple Pay‌‌ can be used in The Netherlands with several online and high street retailers including Adidas, ALDI, Amac, ARKET, BCC, Burger King, Capi, cool blue, COS, Decathlon, Douglas, H&amp;M, Jumbo, Lidl, McDonalds, Starbucks, and others.

                    <span>Ahead of next week&#x27;s Apple event, which is expected to include the launch of the iPhone 13 lineup, a Chinese AI firm is asking a court to stop the production and sale of the iPhone in China, alleging that Siri infringes upon its patent, South China Morning Post reports.





Apple last year was hit with a $1.4 billion lawsuit from the Chinese AI firm Xiao-i Robot, which claims Apple violated its patent for a virtual assistant similar to ‌Siri‌. At the time, the firm had asked Apple to cease &quot;manufacturing, using, promising to sell, selling, and importing&quot; all products that &quot;infringe&quot; upon its patent, which would include all devices with ‌Siri‌.

                    <span>Ahead of next week&#x27;s Apple event, Apple has begun teasing iPhone users about upcoming iOS 15 features using a notification from the Tips app.





&quot;See what&#x27;s coming in ‌iOS 15‌,&quot; reads the notification. &quot;Learn about new features that will help you stay connected and find focus.&quot;



Tapping the notification takes users on a brief tour of upcoming features, including Voice Isolation, the new Shared With You section in apps, Safari Tab Groups, Live Text in Photos, systemwide translation, Focus mode, notification summaries, and augmented reality walking directions in Maps.



After viewing, the ‌iOS 15‌ preview is showcased in the Collections section of the Tips app, above a similar preview Apple pushed out prior to the release of iOS 14.





Apple is expected to launch ‌iOS 15‌ to the public this month, and new iPhone 13 units will likely ship with a pre-installed version of the operating system.





Historically, Apple has released new iOS versions about a week after its September event, but ‌iOS 14‌ was released one day after Apple&#x27;s September 15 &quot;Time Flies&quot; event in 2020. 





This year&#x27;s &quot;California Streaming&quot; fall event is on September 14, which means if ‌iOS 14‌ is any indicator of the company&#x27;s new release schedule, ‌iOS 15‌ could come out as early as Wednesday, September 15. For all the details on what to expect in ‌iOS 15‌, check out our dedicated roundup.

                    <span>Twitter is testing &quot;edge-to-edge&quot; tweets that span the width of the timeline in its official iOS app, a move that would make viewing photos and videos a more full-screen experience.





As Twitter&#x27;s demonstration shows, the change brings an Instagram-style look to tweeted media, making use of the dead space on either side of pictures, videos, and GIFs. 



Twitter told The Verge that it&#x27;s testing the change because it &quot;wants to better support conversations that are both visual and text-based.&quot; 




Now testing on iOS:

The test is being rolled out today with a limited number of users in order to test feedback, and Twitter has given no indication of when it would go live for all users if reaction to it turned out to be sufficiently positive.

                    <span>Mike Lupica, writing for MLB.com:
Jeter was a part of the last Yankee dynasty. His Yankees won four
World Series in five years and nearly made it five in six. In the
middle of all the winning in the late ‘90s for the Yankees of Joe
Torre — the man Jeter calls “Mister Torre” — I was with Jeter
one day at his locker at the old Yankee Stadium.
The Yankees were getting ready for another October, and I said to
him, “You know, this isn’t going to last forever.”
He looked up at me and quietly said, “Why not?”
This was before he made The Flip to get Jeremy Giambi at the plate
in Oakland to save a Yankees season, and before he went 5-for-5 on
the day he got to 3,000 hits with a home run off David Price. But
Jeter was already the player that kids wanted to be. There were
other great Yankees at that time. Still: No. 2 was the one.
And the moment I will always remember best for Jeter, as big and
important and memorable as any he ever had and the old
Stadium ever had, came at the end of Game 4 of the 2001 World
Series, in the middle of three extraordinary nights in the shadow
of 9/11, three nights when the Yankees made a wounded city cheer.
Worth it just for the video clip with Michael Kay’s call: “See ya! See ya! See ya!” Gets you right there.

                    <span>Tyler Kepner, writing for The New York Times, on Derek Jeter’s entry to the Baseball Hall of Fame today:
The next season would end much differently for Jeter: at shortstop
in Yankee Stadium, celebrating his team’s first World Series
title in 18 years. It would ingrain in Jeter a demanding but
matter-of-fact standard, that a season is only successful if it
ends in a championship.
Jeter’s fans loved him for that mentality, and more. […]
He also learned to never make excuses, a lesson embedded in the
Yankee experience. With each passing championship, Jeter said,
Yogi Berra would remind him that he had won a record 10 as a
player. It is tougher to win now, Jeter would protest, citing
modern playoff rounds, but Berra would cut him off.
“His response was: ‘You can come over to my house and count the
rings anytime you want,’” Jeter said. “So I always felt as though
you’re trying to chase something.”
Billy Crystal: “Jeter, simply put, was a winner.”

On the podcast, we talk with Ben about all things app stores. From Apple’s revolutionary launch of the App Store in 2008 to the monopoly-like powers, both Google and Apple now wield today. With multiple lawsuits filed, government investigations ongoing, and developer sentiment at an all-time low, we take an honest look at the challenges and trade-offs in trying to bring two of the world’s largest companies to heal.
This is a great interview with Ben Thompson on all of the big issues currently surrounding Apple&#x27;s App Store. If you&#x27;re a developer on any of Apple&#x27;s platforms, you need to make some time to give this a listen.</span>

Sanheim has quickly become the Flyers’ most polarizing defenseman. What does he bring to the table?
 Seven years after being drafted 17th overall by the Philadelphia Flyers in the 2014 NHL entry draft, Travis Sanheim has become a polarizing figure amongst the fanbase.
The reasons are obvious enough as Sanheim hasn’t exactly cemented himself as a star in the league while seemingly possessing a lot of the tools necessary to do so. From the outside looking in, that’s seemingly caused a large portion of the fanbase to tire of Sanheim over the last few seasons. He’s not a physical player despite being a 6’3” defender, and that seems to be brought up a lot by his detractors, but he’s probably a lot better than he gets credit for.

He was a forward for a little bit!
 It’s hard to separate what Sam Morin was once thought to be with the player he currently is. Not to go and dive into the deep pool of the psychology of fan-thought, but Morin was once thought to be one of the rare players that was set to be the next level of physical defenseman that can still play the game of hockey without their knees combusting every single time they try to skate in smooth strides.
The Philadelphia Flyers certainly drafted him because he was (and still is) a 6-foot-6 defenseman. And as his progression was closely followed, trying to find any answer to the team’s defensive woes in their teenaged prospects, Morin slowly became a post-hype guy that would eventually be thought of being lucky to find …</span>

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *The Flyers announced their newest crop of potential inductees into the franchise Hall of Fame yesterday, and if you ask us? Get Lou Nolan in there or gtfo. What say you? [BSH]
*All of these guys could get in though! Or some! Remains to be seen. [Inquirer]
*Anyhoo, back to Dev Camp real quick: let’s talk standouts. [BSH]
*And while we are talking kids, it’s prospect time over at Charlie’s website this week. First up, his run through of the top-20 best prospects in the organization right now. [The Athletic]
*We’re continuing to look back at how guys performed last year and this time it’s Justin Braun. [BSH]
*As we look ahead to training camp there are a few interesting storylines league-wide that still need wrapping up. [Sportsnet]
*And finally, as we look even further ahead to the Olympics, there are a few Flyers who could plausibly end up on the roster for their respective countries, in our opinion. Which will make watching way more fun. [BSH]</span>

Pick up a game bundle for $10
 A group of game developers has banded together to offer a game bundle on itch.io, with the proceeds going towards relief for people in Louisiana who’ve been impacted by Hurricane Ida. The hurricane was the fifth most powerful storm to ever hit the state, and the clean-up is ongoing. This bundle goes for $10 and includes a buffet of indie games. As of this writing, the sale has raised nearly $17,000 — far exceeding its $5000 goal.


The bundle, which contains games from a variety of creators across Louisiana, will support “a few different charities, nonprofits, and boots-on-the-ground organizations across southeast Louisiana that are already making an impact,” according to the description on itch.io. These organizations include Cajun Navy, Bucket Brigade, and the Louisiana SPCA.
New Blood Interactive, a game dev collective, has also donated $6,660 to the drive, with half of it going to people affected by Ida in New York City. 
This looks like a great way to sample a few different games that you may not have tried otherwise, while also helping a good cause. The offer will expire on Friday, and more games may be added before the end of the sale.</span>

Both literally and in a longterm sense
 Fallout Worlds is a much more customizable take on Fallout 76, one that allows players to twist various dials under the hood of the game. Change the weather on a whim, jump off cliff sides, or set up a little township with your pals. These private servers are meant to be the foundation for future updates, and Bethesda is watching to see how players use these tools and what worlds they begin to build.
At its foundation, Worlds provides options that run along a gradient. On one end of the extreme, you have sandbox silliness. Jump super high, walk through the Wasteland while random enemies constantly chase you around, or fire infinite Fat Man nukes at your friends. On the other end of the spectrum…</span>

The Avengers aren’t done yet
 Marvel’s Avengers is continuing on after its recent War for Wakanda expansion with a new hero and activity type coming later this year. On Wednesday, Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics confirmed that Spider-Man will join Marvel’s Avengers alongside the game’s first raid.
A year after launch, players will finally get a raid in Marvel’s Avengers. Players will battle Klaw, the primary villain of War for Wakanda, in a new and unique boss fight. Crystal Dynamics promised that heroes will battle new enemies in the raid and that this is an entirely new activity type — different from the super-hard Omega Level Threat that launched this Summer.

      The new raid and Spider-Man are the highlights for the rest of 2021
  
Spider-Man, a character that’s exclusive to the PlayStation versions of Marvel’s Avengers, will also be out by the end of this year. Crystal Dynamics originally announced Spider-Man’s exclusivity just before launch last year. While the raid and Spider-Man don’t have exact dates, the promo image for the raid shows Spider-Man swinging toward Klaw. So it seems likely PlayStation players will already have their hands on the web-head before going up against Marvel’s Avengers first big bad.


The road map for the rest of 2021 also includes a host of reworks for the game’s material economy and gear upgrades. Old events will also come back around before the end of this year, and players will see even more skins inspired by the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Crystal Dynamics will reveal more information about its 2022 plans by the end of the year, but it assured Polygon that more Marvel’s Avengers content is coming.</span>

The movie’s magazine is based on the New Yorker and in advance of its release, Anderson has published an anthology of articles from the actual New Yorker (and other magazines) that inspired the characters in the film. It’s called An Editor’s Burial.

                    <span>Oh, I really like this new NYC subway mosaic installed in the corridor between Times Square and Bryant Park designed by Nick Cave.1 It’s based on Cave’s Soundsuits project, full-body suits that “camouflage the shape of the wearer, enveloping and creating a second skin that hides gender, race, and class, thus compelling the audience to watch without judgment”. From a NY Times piece on the mosaic:
The Soundsuits have always been an amalgam of cultural references, Cave explained: the concepts of shamans and masquerade, obscuring the race, gender and class of the wearer and forging a new identity. They contain ties to Africa, the Caribbean and Haiti.
“It’s very important that you can make references, you can connect to something,” Cave said. “In one of the mosaics in the corridor, there’s a sneaker. So that brings it to this urban, right-now time.”
From beneath a pink-and-black cloak of raffia, carefully crafted out of glass shards, pokes a contemporary sneaker in shades of salmon, white and maroon. Cave likes the play that’s happening here: The form is sometimes figurative, sometimes abstract. “Sometimes it’s identifiable and sometimes it’s not,” he said. “But that’s the beauty of it all.”

No, not that Nick Cave.↩

                    <span>A new unique #AppleEvent &quot;hashflag&quot; has surfaced on Twitter for next week&#x27;s &quot;California Streaming&quot; all-digital Apple event to increase visibility and maximize hype on the social media network.





The custom Twitter hashtag includes a multi-colored Apple logo, and it&#x27;s live as of 1:00 p.m. Pacific Time. 



Apple has used the little icons next to hashtags on Twitter for all its previous events since late last year. The company&#x27;s first use of a hashflag was for its September 2020 event, when it announced the iPad Air and Apple Watch.



Twitter allows brands to add the custom emojis next to hashtags as a marketing strategy. According to Agency Creative, each one can cost upwards of one million dollars, and they are commonly used for large events like the Super Bowl or holidays.



Apple&#x27;s event is set to take place on Tuesday, September 14, where it is expected to announce the new iPhone 13 lineup alongside the Apple Watch Series 7.

                    <span>Doug Field, Apple&#x27;s Vice President of Special Projects, is leaving Apple and abandoning his work on the Apple Car in favor of a position at Ford, Ford announced today.





Field has jumped from company to company in recent years, and since 2018, he has been leading ‌Apple Car‌ development alongside Bob Mansfield and John Giannandrea, who took over leadership for the project in late 2020. Prior to joining Apple in 2018, Field worked at Tesla and oversaw the production of the Model 3.



Before working at Tesla, Field was Apple&#x27;s Vice President of Mac Hardware Engineering, so this is the second time he has departed the Cupertino company. In total, he spent eight and a half years at Apple.

                    <span>One of the splashier car introductions for this year is the relaunch of the iconic Jeep Wagoneer brand as an all-new full-size SUV to compete against the likes of the Cadillac Escalade and Lincoln Navigator. The new 2022 Jeep Wagoneer is also available as a Grand Wagoneer, but rather than being a larger version of an already large SUV, the &quot;Grand&quot; designation is used to represent higher trim lines and some minor changes to styling.





Jeep invited me up to New York City recently to take a look at the Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer, which have gone all-in on technology with up to nine LCD screens scattered throughout the vehicle and new Fire TV integration that takes rear entertainment to the next level.

                    <span>Apple today released a second revised version of the AirTags firmware that was first provided to ‌AirTags‌ owners in late August. The new internal build number is 1A291e, up from 1A291c from the prior revision.





There&#x27;s no word on what&#x27;s included in the new firmware and no new features were found following the first release, so it likely focuses on bug fixes and other under-the-hood improvements.



Apple does not provide an option to force an AirTag update, as it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s done over-the-air through a connected iPhone. To make sure the update happens, you can put your AirTag in range of your ‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌, but you have to wait for the firmware to roll out to your device.



For AirTag firmware releases, Apple appears to have a system that limits the number of people who see the update with each deployment to meter the rollout of the software. Today&#x27;s firmware update jumps to a 25 percent rollout level, up from 10 percent with the prior version of the firmware. 



You can check your current AirTag firmware version using the Find My app, with instructions available in our how to.

                    <span>Hulu today informed customers that it is planning to raise the price of its ad-supported and ad-free on-demand plans by $1, an increase that will impact both new and existing subscribers.





The ad-supported plan, which costs $5.99, is going up to $6.99 per month, while the ad-free plan will be priced at $12.99, up from $11.99. The pricing changes are set to go into effect on October 8.



Pricing on the Disney Bundle that includes access to Hulu ad-supported content, Disney+, and ESPN+ is not changing, and it will continue to be available for $13.99. The Disney Bundle with ad-free Hulu is still $19.99.



Now that there&#x27;s a $1 price difference between the ad-free Hulu subscription and the lower tier Disney Bundle, customers may be more willing to choose the Disney bundle to get access to all three Disney streaming services. As Variety points out, the bundle now provides a 36 percent discount compared to separate subscriptions.



The Hulu + Live TV plans are also not changing in price at this time and continue to start at $64.99 per month.



Hulu has never before raised the price of its ad-supported tier, and in 2019, dropped the cost from $7.99 per month to $5.99 per month. Hulu is still competitively priced with Netflix, which is priced starting at $8.99 for a basic plan and goes all the way up to $17.99 per month for the premium tier.

                    <span>Apple today seeded the ninth beta of the upcoming tvOS 15 update to developers for testing purposes, with the new beta coming one week released the eighth beta.





Developers can download the new tvOS 15 beta by downloading a profile onto the ‌Apple TV‌ using Xcode.



Apple shared little about tvOS 15 when it was unveiled, but there are some new features that are coming to the operating system. SharePlay, a FaceTime feature that lets multiple users watch TV shows or movies together, will integrate with tvOS, and there&#x27;s a new &quot;For All of You&quot; recommendation engine that suggests shows everyone might enjoy.



A Shared With You section also displays movies and shows that were shared with you through the Messages app so you remember to check them out. When paired with AirPods Pro or AirPods Max, the ‌Apple TV‌ supports Spatial audio for a theater-like surround sound experience, and there&#x27;s a new feature for automatically connecting your AirPods through Smart ‌AirPods‌ routing.



Hey Siri commands can be used to launch Apple TV+ shows, and two HomePod mini speakers can be paired with the ‌Apple TV‌ 4K for stereo sound. If you have HomeKit cameras, you can also now view multiple cameras at the same time on the ‌Apple TV‌.

                    <span>Apple this morning announced a digital-only event that will be held on Tuesday, September 14, and if you view the event webpage on an iPhone, you can tap on the logo to open up Apple&#x27;s Safari AR viewer and you&#x27;ll see the three-dimensional logo move in real-time in the real world.





Just open up the event site on an ‌iPhone‌ or iPad and tap right on the logo to open up the AR version. The graphic Apple is using for the event reflects the shining outline of the Apple logo seen in the event invite, and you can use AR to tunnel through it, where a starry night lake scene and the event date are revealed.



Apple often creates graphical experiences for its events, with AR being at the center of recent efforts. In the past, it also had an October iPad event where it created dozens of different Apple logos, and people often analyze event art designs to decipher possible signs of what to expect when it comes to product announcements.

                    <span>Apple today announced that it will be holding a special event on Tuesday, September 14 at 10:00 a.m. The event will take place at the Steve Jobs Theater on the Apple Park campus in Cupertino, California.





As with WWDC and last year&#x27;s fall events, this new event will be held digitally with no members of the media invited to attend in person. Apple will likely provide pre-taped segments for each new product that&#x27;s announced.



Last year&#x27;s September event focused on the Apple Watch after the iPhone was delayed until October, but this year, things are back to normal. We&#x27;re expecting Apple to announce new iPhone 13 models, the Apple Watch Series 7, and possibly the AirPods 3.

                    <span>Only six percent of iPhone users in the United States who have Apple Pay set up actually use the feature, according to a detailed study by PYMNTS.





Seven years after ‌Apple Pay‌ launched in September 2014, 93.9 percent of consumers with ‌Apple Pay‌ activated on their ‌iPhone‌ do not use it to pay for in-store purchases, meaning that only 6.1 percent do.



In 2015, the year following ‌Apple Pay‌&#x27;s launch, PYMNTS found that ‌Apple Pay‌ usage was just 5.1 percent among those that had the feature activated. This means that ‌Apple Pay‌ usage has only increased by one percentage point in six years.

                    <span>The UK mobile carrier Sky is today teasing the launch of &quot;the next generation,&quot; in what may be a hint at the seemingly impending launch of the iPhone 13 lineup.





The company&#x27;s webpage says that &quot;the next generation is about to land&quot; in an &quot;upcoming big announcement,&quot; and encourages customers to sign up before Tuesday, September 14, to get access to an exclusive Sky Mobile offer.



The promotion has attracted interest since all indications are pointing to Apple planning to hold a digital event on September 14 to announce the ‌iPhone 13‌, Apple Watch Series 7, and third-generation AirPods, which is the same day that the early-bird Sky Mobile offer ends. There is no other sign from Sky that the offer relates to the ‌iPhone 13‌.




We think it&#x27;s time to treat yourself to something new 👀
Sky Mobile customers: if there&#x27;s one good choice you make today, let it be registering your interest to to get all the info on the upcoming announcement, trust us 🎁

Some carriers have been known to provide discounted offers to customers who sign up to a contract for a next-generation iPhone model before it is officially announced, and this marketing appears to be in line with those similar promotions in the past. It is also possible that the announcement relates to something else entirely, but the September 14 date is sufficient proof for some observers that it relates to the ‌iPhone 13‌ lineup.



If the ‌iPhone 13‌ is set to be unveiled next week on September 14 as rumors suggest, invites would likely be sent out later today.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/07/whatsapp-last-seen-hide-from-specific-contacts/">

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>WhatsApp is working on giving users the option to adjust the visibility of their &quot;Last Seen&quot; status on a contact-by-contact basis, according to a new report from forthcoming-feature specialist WABetaInfo.





As regular WhatsApp users will know, the &quot;Last Seen&quot; status of a contact sits atop the conversation thread, informing you when that contact last opened and was active on the app.



Currently, you can disable your &quot;Last Seen&quot; status so that other contacts can&#x27;t see when you were last online, but the setting&#x27;s options are limited to &quot;Everyone,&quot; &quot;My Contacts,&quot; and &quot;Nobody,&quot; and there&#x27;s no way to make exceptions for individual contacts.



However, that looks set to change, based on options unearthed by WABetaInfo in a beta version of WhatsApp. In the Privacy settings, the messaging platform is adding the option &quot;My Contacts Except...&quot; which will let you select specific contacts so that they don&#x27;t see when the last time was that you were active on the messaging network. 





Although it&#x27;s worth noting that if you disable your last seen status for specific contacts, you won&#x27;t be able to see theirs either.



The new &quot;My Contacts Except...&quot; option is also evident in the privacy settings for a user&#x27;s profile picture and &quot;About&quot; information, indicating WhatsApp&#x27;s intention to bring more granular settings to the app&#x27;s privacy options as a whole.



As usual, it&#x27;s unclear when the new options will go live, but given they were discovered on iOS, expect them to appear on iPhone first, with the Android version to follow.

                    <span>Sofia Coppola&#x27;s Apple TV+ comedy &quot;On the Rocks&quot; will be released on Blu-Ray and DVD next month, the first ‌Apple TV+‌ movie to be made available on physical media.





First revealed by Sigmund Judge, &quot;On the Rocks&quot; can be pre-ordered now on Amazon for $17.99. According to the Blu-Ray version information, the physical disc is being distributed by Lionsgate and will ship from October 26, 2021, meaning its exclusivity will no longer be through ‌‌Apple TV+‌‌ on Apple&#x27;s devices and supported TVs and streaming boxes.



&quot;On the Rocks&quot; stars Rashida Jones, Bill Murray, and Marlon Wayans, and tells the story of Laura, a young mother in New York faced with sudden doubts about her marriage.



Laura teams up with her impulsive father Felix, who insists they investigate the situation, leading to an adventure across the city and a generational clash about how people see relationships differently from their parents.



Coppola and Murray last collaborated on 2003&#x27;s &quot;Lost in Translation,&quot; which won Coppola an Academy Award for original screenplay and earned Murray an Oscar nomination for Best Actor.



The only other ‌Apple TV+‌ original available for customers to purchase on Blu-ray and DVD is the drama series &quot;Defending Jacob,&quot; which made the jump to physical media in July, courtesy of Paramount.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/07/anker-nano-pro-20w-adapter/">
                  <div class="article-summary-box-inner">
                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Last October, Anker debuted its 20-watt Anker Nano power adapter, a high-speed charger only slightly larger than Apple&#x27;s standard 5-watt adapter. Ahead of the iPhone 13 launch, Anker today is introducing a refresh for its Anker Nano, which arrives under the name of Anker Nano Pro and comes in four color options: black, white, blue, and purple.





The Anker Nano Pro has a single USB-C port and essentially the same baseline specs as the Anker Nano, but some of the internals have been tweaked to optimize performance and Anker&#x27;s ActiveShield safety system features advanced temperature monitoring and power output control to help protect your device while it&#x27;s fast charging.





The color options for the Anker Nano Pro are part of what Anker says is a &quot;new direction&quot; for the company that will see it expanding beyond the basic black and white options it&#x27;s used on most of its products over the years. Other recent colorful product additions for Anker include the lavender grey and mint green versions of the original Anker Nano, several color options for its PowerLine cables, and even the MagSafe-compatible PowerCore Magnetic 5K.



For those looking for a bit more versatility in Anker&#x27;s lineup of diminutive power adapters, the company is also working on a Nano Pro Dual that will feature 40 watts of charging power and two ports. More information and a launch date for that model will be coming at a later date.



The single-port Anker Nano Pro is available now from Amazon and is priced at $19.99.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/07/magsafe-charger-filing-new-iphones/">
                  <div class="article-summary-box-inner">
                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Apple has referenced four unreleased iPhones in an updated FCC filing for its MagSafe charger, while at the same time referencing the currently released iPhone 12 lineup as &quot;legacy&quot; iPhones. 





The new filing doesn&#x27;t reveal any details about a possible update to the ‌MagSafe‌ charger; instead, the filing only includes updated testing based on new equipment. In the equipment section of the filing, Apple lists four &quot;New Phone&quot; items while also listing A2176, A2172, A2341, and A2342, which correspond to the iPhone 12 mini, ‌iPhone 12‌, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max, respectively, as &quot;legacy&quot; devices.



Earlier in the summer, Apple registered four new iPhone models in the EEC database, providing us with model IDs for the upcoming iPhones. However, today&#x27;s new filing doesn&#x27;t include any model numbers for the &quot;New Phone&quot; items, making it difficult to tie a connection between the filing and the EEC entry.



Amongst the features expected for the iPhone 13, Apple is expected to be improving the strength of the MagSafe magnets on the back of the new iPhones. While the filing doesn&#x27;t confirm that, Apple may have needed to retest the charger as per FCC regulation on the new iPhones, given their stronger ‌MagSafe‌ system than the 2020 lineup. 



Apple is widely expected to be holding an all-digital event next week on Tuesday, September 14, where it will announce the ‌iPhone 13‌ as well as the Apple Watch Series 7. Apple may confirm the event as early as Tuesday.

                    <span>Michael Wayland, reporting for CNBC:
Ford Motor said Tuesday it hired former Tesla and Apple executive
Doug Field to lead its emerging technology efforts, a key focus
for the automaker under its new Ford+ turnaround plan.
Field — who led development of Tesla’s Model 3 — most recently
served as vice president of special projects at Apple, which
reportedly included the tech giant’s Titan car project.
The hire is a major addition for Ford and a big hit to Apple
and its secret car project, which the company has yet to
confirm exists.
Maybe it’s as simple as Field wanting to work on something that’s actually going to ship?

                    <span>David Leonhardt, writing for The New York Times:
The estimates here are based on statistics from three places that
have reported detailed data on Covid infections by vaccination
status: Utah; Virginia; and King County, which includes Seattle,
in Washington state. All three are consistent with the idea that
about one in 5,000 vaccinated Americans have tested positive for
Covid each day in recent weeks.
The chances are surely higher in the places with the worst Covid
outbreaks, like the Southeast. And in places with many fewer
cases — like the Northeast, as well as the Chicago, Los Angeles
and San Francisco areas — the chances are lower, probably less
than 1 in 10,000. That’s what the Seattle data shows, for
example. (These numbers don’t include undiagnosed cases, which
are often so mild that people do not notice them and do not pass
the virus to anyone else.)
Here’s one way to think about a one-in-10,000 daily chance: It
would take more than three months for the combined risk to reach
just 1 percent.
Breakthrough cases for the vaccinated are far more rare than many people have been led to believe through clickbait headlines.

                    <span>Karen Webster, writing for the oddly-named Pymnts:
Seven years post-launch, new PYMNTS data shows that 93.9% of
consumers with Apple Pay activated on their iPhones do not use it
in-store to pay for purchases.
That means only 6.1% do.
That finding is based on PYMNTS’ national study of 3,671 U.S.
consumers conducted between Aug. 3-10, 2021. After seven years,
Apple Pay’s adoption and usage isn’t much larger than it was 2015
(5.1%), a year after its launch, and is the same as it was in
2019, the last full year before the pandemic.
It doesn’t really make sense to me that adoption isn’t much higher than it was in 2015, and if these survey results are accurate, I find them surprisingly low. I’d have guessed somewhere in the 15–20 percent range. If it’s true adoption is this low, I think one factor could be first impressions — my wife got turned off by Apple Pay in the earlier years because so many retail terminals that supposedly accepted it were so finicky. Using an old-fashioned credit card was more reliable. Also, habits. But I use Apple Pay today whenever I can, and I find it more reliable than tap-and-pay with a physical card.
Nick Heer, writing at Pixel Envy:
This survey shows an approximately flat use rate from 2019 through
2021, down slightly from 2018. Webster writes that the pandemic
ought to have “changed the trajectory of Apple Pay” as
“contactless and touchless have become the consumer’s checkout
mantra”. But anyone with a Face ID-equipped iPhone can tell you
that wearing a mask requires you to authenticate by using your
passcode, so it has been far easier for the past eighteen months
to simply tap a card. That is probably true generally, as well;
Apple Pay may have better privacy and security, but it is no
easier to use than a card that supports tap to pay, even without
the added complication of pandemic precautions.
Apple Pay with Apple Watch works well while wearing a face mask, but using your iPhone sucks.

                    <span>A virtual event — which is not the least bit surprising but still a bit of a bummer. No guess from me as to what, if anything, the invitation means. Here’s Greg Joswiak’s tweet, which has a brief video teaser.
Update: And there’s another nifty AR Easter egg on Apple’s main events page, viewable from an iPhone.

A surprise retirement forced Braun to return and be the old guy on the blue line.
 The moment Matt Niskanen retired, the stop-gap solution was quickly taken, gobbled up like a last piece of ham and stuffed down your hole, and that ham was Justin Braun. The elder veteran of the blue line that was acquired for a couple draft picks from the San Jose Sharks the summer prior, was on an expiring deal and while it might have made sense just to let him walk, with another established right-handed shot parting ways with the NHL, then it kind of fit that they just brought back this dude that they’re already familiar with.
Signing a two-year deal, Braun was given a little bit of a longer commitment than normal for a 34-year-old blueliner, but they must have just…</span>

Let’s talk prospects!
 At long last! The Flyers’ Development Camp made its triumphant return last week, and though not everyone was able to make it, it was still a great chance to check in with a number of prospects for the first time in a little while, and for some, the first time ever. We’ve got lots of notes to get to, so let’s get right into it. 
Five stars
Tyson Foerster
If we’re looking for someone who, while not having come into camp with the most buzz, very quickly asserted himself as one of the biggest standouts, Foerster would be your guy. 
One of the first bits to note is that his skating already looks a bit better. This was something that was talked a lot about after he was drafted as being an issue, and while, after watching him with the Phantoms la…</span>

NHL players are officially returning to the Winter Olympics, and several Flyers players could end up representing their countries in Beijing.
 It’s official. The NHL and NHLPA announced Friday that they have reached an agreement with the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) allowing NHL players to participate in the upcoming Winter Olympics in Beijing after they were unable to compete in Pyeongchang.
This news hardly comes as a surprise as the NHL went so far as to include a two-week Olympic break during its regular-season schedule in order to accommodate their inevitable agreement with the IIHF.
With NHL players returning to the Olympics, this could mean that multiple Flyers players will be headed overseas to represent their countr…</span>

Well with the unofficial end of Summer behind us, we’ve got nothing to do but look forward to the rapidly approaching season. First up will be training camp, and a few young players are going to have to earn a spot if they want one, because right now they’re all filled up. [NBC Sports Philly]
*Speaking of young players, the Flyers took a big bet on Joel Farabee and while we’ll have to wait to see how it pans out, Charlie breaks down all the reasons why it was a good bet to make regardless. [The Athletic]
*We learned the the NHL will definitely officially be sending players to the Olympics this year, and we may see a couple of Flyers, which is fun. [Inquirer]
*Despite the agreement between the IIHF and the league coming to fruition, there’s still work to be done there. [ProHockeyTalk]
*Anyhoo, back to the Flyers. Predictions are starting to happen and some folks seem to think that the Metro might end up being a super tight race for the playoffs. Again. [Pensburgh]
*Despite this big impressive offseason, Chuck Fletcher is still considered a middle-of-the-pack general manager. He may just prove that wrong though! [ProHockeyTalk]
*The Habs didn’t match the Kotkaniemi offer sheet — shocking! — so he’s a Canes now. [Canes Country]
*And finally, a brand spanking new Flyperbole!! Perfect for a fake Monday. [BSH]</span>

Sledgehammer calls Vanguard ‘the most tactical experience you’ve ever had in Call of Duty’
 This year’s Call of Duty will introduce new environmental destruction features in multiplayer, developer Sledgehammer Games said during a reveal stream on Tuesday, which will change the layout and flow of Call of Duty: Vanguard’s maps. Players also have another reason to be wary even while they’re behind cover: One of the game’s multiplayer weapon perks will let players see their opponents through walls in certain situations.
In the video reveal for Call of Duty: Vanguard’s multiplayer, Sledgehammer developers discussed the breadth of competitive modes coming in this year’s game. During one section featuring multiplayer creative director Greg Reisdorf, l…</span>

The new map will run on the same engine as Vanguard
 Raven Software has released the first new details on Call of Duty: Warzone’s upcoming map, which will be set in the Pacific.  The developer revealed the new information, along with a few screenshots, on Tuesday, during Call of Duty: Vanguard’s multiplayer reveal stream.
Like everything related to Vanguard, Warzone’s new map will be World War II-themed. The map is set in the Pacific, on an island with dense foliage and a few small towns and cities for players to fight in. Based on the early footage, it seems like the map will be a lot more tropical than Verdansk, and should feature more fighting in the jungles than the more urban settings of previous maps. 
The new Warzone map will also run on the same engine as Call of Duty: Vanguard — which is essentially the same engine as Modern Warfare and the original version of Warzone’s Verdansk. According to Raven Software, this means that the game will easily integrate with Vanguard, including its weapons and gameplay style, which should be present on the new Pacific theater map when it’s released sometime later this fall. 
The other major Warzone update that Raven Software offered on Tuesday was an update about the game’s new anti-cheat system. Unfortunately, that update didn’t really contain any new or meaningful details. But with Warzone cheating as bad as it’s been recently, it’s nice to hear that Raven is still hard at work on the new system. In a Call of Duty blog post on Tuesday, Raven called the system a “multifaceted new anti-cheat system for PC,” and explained that it’s still testing the system at the moment, but that it should be ready for Warzone’s Pacific map launch.

The skins change as you move and include plenty of music
 Riot has announced the latest line of weapon skins for Valorant, but the developer had some help this time around. For this batch, Riot collaborated with EDM artist Zedd to make a line up of musically infused weapon varieties. 
The skin line will be called Spectrum, and Riot debuted the first look at each of the guns on Tuesday. The bundle includes skins for the Phantom, Guardian, Bulldog and Classic weapons, as well as for the knife melee weapon. Each skin has three variant colors (purple, red, and black) and a few upgrades, which players can unlock with Radianite Points. 
The skins’ base variety is a sleek white with bright LEDs on the side, which change colors as you move, like the lights in a club. Spectrum skins also have unique animations for kills, a variety of unique firing sounds, and their round-finisher upgrade turns the map into a giant dance party. 
This latest skin line isn’t the first time that Riot has collaborated with Zedd either. Back in 2016, the artist did the theme song for that year’s League of Legends World Championship — a track that remains a favorite of League fans today. While Riot has made plenty of exciting skins in the past, Spectrum seems to have some of the most complicated cosmetics the developer has ever made for Valorant. They’re definitely the most in-depth since last year’s Elderflame skins.
The Spectrum skin line is set to arrive in the Valorant in-game store on Wednesday, a day before the game’s new map, Fracture, will be released. The bundle, which includes all the skins, two gun buddies, a player card, and a spray, will cost a whopping 10,700 Valorant Points. For some perspective there, 11,000 Valorant Points costs $99.99.</span>

World Update 6 will also include a new terrain setting for high-performance PCs
 Microsoft Flight Simulator’s next big update enhances the look of Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. Called World Update 6, developers showed off a new trailer during the annual Gamescom gaming convention. The free update launches on Sept. 7 for Windows PC and Xbox.
Head of Microsoft Flight Simulator Jorg Neumann tells Polygon that this particular World Update contains some of the most current data that’s ever been added to the game.
“We pick a region when we have great data: new satellite data, new aerial data,” Neumann said. “In this case, we have new aerials and satellite from 2020, so it’s what we call ‘fresh.’ And then we work with, oftentimes, the [regional …</span>

TSMC, Apple&#x27;s main chip supplier, is in the process of increasing its prices following wider inflation in the industry caused by the global chip supply shortage. The company&#x27;s planned price rises are said to be the most substantial chip price hikes in a decade.



TSMC&#x27;s chips were already around 20 percent more expensive than those from its direct rivals, but smaller foundries have ramped up their own prices due to higher material and logistics costs, and TSMC has committed to $100 billion in new investment over the next three years, motivating the company to increase its prices to maintain its premium and pass these added cos…</span>

                    <span>Drake&#x27;s latest album &quot;Certified Lover Boy&quot; is Apple Music&#x27;s most-streamed album in 24 hours in the services&#x27; history, Apple revealed to Billboard over the weekend.



 

The album was released at midnight EST on Friday, September 3, and is the sixth studio album from the artist. It features a number of prominent rappers, including Jay-Z, Lil Wayne, Future, Rick Ross, and Lil Baby.



&quot;Certified Lover Boy&quot; is a 21-track album and features Apple&#x27;s pregnant woman emojis on its album cover. The cover notes describe the album as &quot;a combination of toxic masculinity and acceptance of truth which is inevitably heartbreaking,&quot; and is executive produced by Drake, Noah “40” Shebib, Oliver El-Khatib and Noel Cadastre. 



The album had already reportedly broke the record for the most-streamed album in 2021 in under 12 hours on the service.



The new record comes just three days after Kanye West&#x27;s &quot;Donda&quot; broke Apple Music&#x27;s day-one streams record for 2021 with 60 million plays in the United States.

                    <span>Taiwan&#x27;s Railways Administration (TRA) has officially announced support for using Apple Pay when purchasing train tickets with the service&#x27;s e-booking mobile app.





In a press release on its website, the country&#x27;s railway operator said it was making the new &quot;‌Apple Pay‌ ticketing service&quot; available from September 7 in order to improve convenience for passengers when booking tickets via the official mobile app.



After passing the initial verification, the payment procedure will be completed via ‌Apple Pay‌, saving users the time it takes to enter their credit card number, said the operator.



Alongside ‌Apple Pay‌ support, the TRA&#x27;s new membership system is launching a reward scheme where passengers can accumulate redeemable points for using the mobile ticket purchasing mechanism. 



Every 50 NT dollar spent is converted into 1 point, and every 2 points points can be redeemed to earn up to a 30% discount on the price of a ticket. Originally, the scheme was only open at the physical ticket windows where points could be used to buy train tickets, but the mobile app now supports the feature, too.

                    <span>A now-deleted video purporting to show official Apple silicone cases for the &quot;iPhone 13 Pro Max&quot; appears to corroborate the &quot;‌iPhone 13‌&quot; naming convention for the company&#x27;s upcoming 2021 iPhone lineup.

Originally shared online last week by Twitter account @PinkDon1, the video shows a batch of silicone cases in white boxes, held together by elastic bands, with the labels reading &quot;‌iPhone 13‌ Pro Max Silicone Case&quot; along with the MagSafe branding below it.

In the latest edition of his Power On newsletter, Gurman outlines three potential outcomes of Apple&#x27;s production headaches: The company delays its Apple Watch announcement until the production issues are resolved, it goes ahead with the announcement and makes the Series 7 available in limited quantities, or Apple announces the watch but doesn&#x27;t make it available until a later date.

                    <span>Apple&#x27;s Safari app has undergone a number of changes during the iOS 15 beta testing process. Apple started out with a radical new design that moved the address bar from the top of the app&#x27;s interface and introduced a floating tab bar, but after a multitude of complaints, there were several redesigns that culminated in an option to undo the ‌iOS 15‌ design entirely.





This guide walks through all of the features added in the ‌iOS 15‌ Safari app, including those new design options.



Design Changes


Safari started out with a new floating tab design that moved the address bar and tabs to the bottom of the iPhone interface, but now the design change is optional.





In the Safari section of the Settings app, you can choose your tab view. The &quot;Tab Bar&quot; option moves the a…</span>

                    <span>A former Chrysler proving grounds for automotive testing outside of Phoenix, Arizona, that has been rumored to be used by Apple was recently purchased for $125 million by the firm that has been leasing it for the past five years, according to AZ Big Media.





Back in 2017, it was reported that a company by the name of Route 14 Investment Partners LLC had signed a lease to use the facility, with rumors suggesting Apple was behind the deal, although there was no definitive proof of the link. Route 14 is represented by the Phoenix office of law firm Greenberg Traurig, hiding the true ownership of the company.



Route 14 has now exercised an option to purchase the property, which consists of 34 separate parcels, for $125 million in cash. The purchase agreement is dated June 25, 2021, with a deed and assumption of an existing development agreement with the City of Surprise both dated July 30 and seen by MacRumors.





We have still not been able to concretely tie Apple to Route 14, but it&#x27;s clear that whoever is behind the firm has deep pockets and a long-term interest in the testing facility.



Rumors about Apple&#x27;s work on both autonomous driving systems and actual electric vehicles have ebbed and flowed over the last several years. The most recent report just this week claimed that Apple has been visiting with Toyota as it seeks to develop a supplier network with an eye toward producing an Apple-branded car starting in 2024.

                    <span>Apple has hired two former Mercedes engineers to join the company, likely as part of its effort to continue to build out its internal workforce as the development of an &quot;Apple Car&quot; continues.





The leading new hire previously worked at Mercedes, focusing on mass production of vehicles, vehicle steering, dynamics, and software and project management. The hire, now working as a product design engineer at Apple at its &quot;Special Projects Group,&quot; also previously worked at Porsche, undertaking similar responsibilities. A second engineer who previously worked at Mercedes has also recently been tapped by Apple to join the company, MacRumors has learned.

                    <span>Apple has delayed the rollout of the Child Safety Features that it announced last month following negative feedback, the company has today announced.





The planned features include scanning users&#x27; iCloud Photos libraries for Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM), Communication Safety to warn children and their parents when receiving or sending sexually explicit photos, and expanded CSAM guidance in Siri and Search.



Apple confirmed that feedback from customers, non-profit and advocacy groups, researchers, and others about the plans has prompted the delay to give the company time to make improvements. Apple issued the following statement about its decision:

                    <span>YouTube says it has passed 50 million subscribers for its Premium and Music subscriptions, making it the &quot;fastest growing music subscription&quot; service in the world, according to YouTube&#x27;s global head of music, Lyor Cohen. 





YouTube says that it has more than 50 million paying subscribers collectively across YouTube Premium and YouTube Music. The Google-owned service says it attributes this milestone to several factors, but mainly due to how subscribers can get &quot;uninterrupted access to the largest and most diverse catalogue of music, artists and culture&quot; through its subscriptions.

We&#x27;ve got killer products in YouTube Music and YouTube Premium that deliver truly unique value to artists and creators and the best experience for music fans and video lovers. We&#x27;re in our own lane -- there&#x27;s no other place where fans can get uninterrupted access to the largest and most diverse catalogue of music, artists and culture. We&#x27;re making it easy for music fans to go deep and find their thing -- whether that&#x27;s on YouTube or the YouTube Music app. 
YouTube Music comes as part of a YouTube Premium subscription but can also be purchased standalone. With YouTube Premium, customers can download videos for offline viewing, play videos in the background playback, no ads, and more. 



YouTube Music is one of many competitors to Apple Music, and it&#x27;s hard to name a winner purely based on subscriber count. Apple doesn&#x27;t provide specific subscriber figures, but the latest estimate was 60 million subscribers in 2019. Three years on, the number is likely higher. Additionally, Apple One, which bundles ‌Apple Music‌ with other Apple&#x27;s services, makes it harder to determine how many ‌Apple Music‌ subscribers are out there.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/03/apple-alternative-arm-architecture/">

                    <span>Apple may be exploring the possibility of using an open-source alternative to the Arm architecture, which it&#x27;s been using in its products for decades.





According to a newly posted job alert, spotted by Tom&#x27;s Hardware, Apple is looking for an engineer that specializes in RISC-V, an open-source architecture instruction set that allows device makers to build their own chips without having to pay a license or royalty. Apple currently uses the Arm architecture in its products, and it pays the company a royalty fee to use its instruction set. 



Apple&#x27;s job posting description states that the engineer will implement &quot;innovative RISC-V solutions and state of the art routines&quot; to Apple&#x27;s products. Specifically, Apple hopes prospective engineers will be able to work with the RISC-V instruction set, as well as have an understanding of Arm. 



Tom&#x27;s Hardware theorizes that if Apple were to adopt the open-source instruction set of RISC-V, it may save the company money because it wouldn&#x27;t need to pay Arm a license fee for its instruction set.

Every Arm core requires Apple to pay a licensing fee to Arm, and since the number of cores for things like SSD controllers and smartwatches will only increase, so will Apple&#x27;s payments to Arm. As such, replacing at least some Arm cores with RISC-V cores could save Apple millions of dollars in royalty payments every year...
The job listing is a confirmation that Apple is exploring the use of RISC-V, but whether the company decides to implement the open-source technology remains to be seen. Apple&#x27;s reliance on Arm has increased in the past year as Apple is in the process of switching its Mac lineup to Arm-based processors rather than Intel.

                    <span>Twitter is planning new privacy-related features that provide users with greater control over follower lists and who can see their posts and likes, reports Bloomberg.





The plans are said to include an option to archive old tweets so that other users can&#x27;t see them after a set period of time designated by the account holder (such as 30, 60, or 90 days, or a whole year), as well as the ability to edit follower lists.



According to Bloomberg, the plans are an effort to make people more comfortable interacting and sharing on Twitter, and are related to what Twitter executives call &quot;social privacy,&quot; or how users manage their identities and reputations on the social network. 



Internal research at the company reportedly found that many Twitter users don&#x27;t understand the privacy basics, like whether their account is private or public, which causes them to engage less on the social network because they don&#x27;t know what other people will be able to see about them.



To counter this, Twitter will start prompting users to review whether their accounts are public or private beginning in September. Its privacy team are also working on other potential changes including the ability to remove followers (as opposed to blocking them), hide liked tweets, and remove oneself from a public conversation. 



Twitter has no timeline for some of the changes, while some features, like the archive option, are still in the &quot;concept phase,&quot; but Twitter plans to let people remove followers starting this month, and to let users remove themselves from conversations by the end of the year.

Today we have the very first teaser for Pereira’s indie feature The Chamber of Terror, which hits the festival scene soon. “The […]</span>

                    <span>Here’s a perfect example of what I was talking about in the previous item, about The Wirecutter institutionally fetishizing price over quality. And within “quality” I include design aesthetics, which, let’s face it, almost always goes hand-in-hand with price.
From their current list of “best” drip coffee makers, which is topped by OXO’s $200 Brew 9-Cup:
You can find a number of expensive, stylish coffee makers made in
small quantities for enthusiast audiences. Clive Coffee’s Ratio
Eight and the Chemex Ottomatic are two prominent
examples. They’re all made for connoisseurs who are willing to
spend a lot on a high-end machine. The main draw of these coffee
makers is that they brew similarly to manually making a batch of
pour-over — pre-infusing the grounds and evenly pouring the hot
water. F…</span>

                    <span>The New York Times:
The New York Times Company announced today that Wirecutter, its
product recommendation service, will institute a metered paywall,
asking its frequent users to subscribe for unlimited access to its
research and recommendations. New York Times All Access digital
and home delivery subscribers will continue to receive unlimited
access to Wirecutter’s 1,200+ product reviews, deals coverage and
other guides to help them shop confidently online with their
existing subscription. A standalone subscription to Wirecutter is
available for $5 every four weeks or $40 annually.
This makes sense, and in my opinion, the Times’s paywall rules are among the best in the industry, in terms of offering a generous number of free reads to non-subscribers. But it’s one less “free for everyone to read” high-quality site.
(I have always enjoyed Wirecutter, going back to when they debuted (and had a leading The), but I wish they had a rival that focused less on price. Wirecutter recommendations are very often skewed to the best low-priced product, not the best product in a category, period. I want domain experts to tell me the best products — I can make up my own mind on how much I want to spend.)

                    <span>Jane Manchun Wong:
Each Super Follow is an In-App Purchase on the App Store, but
because there are too many IAPs for the Twitter app, the App Store
only shows 10 instead of the full list.
Her tweet includes this screenshot. The gist is, each Twitter user offering Super Follows gets its own distinct IAP. If there are 1,000 users offering Super Follows, there are 1,000 discrete IAPs in the App Store. If there are 10,000 users offering them, 10,000 IAPs. If there are 100,000, our heads explode.
This is incredible. Ostensibly, Twitter is doing what Apple wants them to do. Right now Super Follows payments are even exclusive to iOS. (Once you pay on iOS, you can see Super Follow content on Twitter’s Android and web clients, too, but the only way to pay is on iOS through IAP.) But Apple’s IAP system is so brittle that Twitter has to make a discrete SKU for each and every Super Follow user, and pay Apple 30 percent of the price for the privilege. (Twitter, per its published terms, takes just 3 percent of the first $50,000 in lifetime earnings, then 20 percent after that.) Also, because Apple’s IAP listings in the App Store rank IAP offerings by popularity, Twitter is being forced to reveal data that they quite likely would prefer to keep to themselves.

Apple spokesman Fred Sainz said he would not provide a statement
on Friday’s announcement because The Washington Post would not
agree to use it without naming the spokesperson.
Fair enough, I suppose, but Albergotti’s blinders have become rather obvious.

                    <span>Apple, in a statement to the media this morning:
Last month we announced plans for features intended to help
protect children from predators who use communication tools to
recruit and exploit them, and limit the spread of Child Sexual
Abuse Material. Based on feedback from customers, advocacy groups,
researchers and others, we have decided to take additional time
over the coming months to collect input and make improvements
before releasing these critically important child safety features.
Accepting feedback and considering that feedback is exactly why they announced these two initiatives in advance, with details, rather than just launching them. Neither of these initiatives should be rushed.

The call was for a vehicle in floodwaters on Route 518 in Hopewell
Township — one of many rescue calls in New Jersey Wednesday
evening as storms from Hurricane Ida flooded the state. Police
Officer James Hoffman went to check it out.
Moments after arriving in the area, east of Route 31 at about 8:30
p.m., Hoffman turned into a victim.
His patrol car started taking on water, then started floating away — sliding sideways about 100 yards into deeper water. Hoffman
ditched his bulky duty vest, climbed through a window and started
swimming. He found a tree and held on.
Amazing story.

                    <span>Stanford Medicine:
A large, randomized trial led by researchers at Stanford Medicine
and Yale University has found that wearing a surgical face mask
over the mouth and nose is an effective way to reduce the
occurrence of COVID-19 in community settings.
It also showed that relatively low-cost, targeted interventions to
promote mask-wearing can significantly increase the use of face
coverings in rural, low-income countries. Based on the results,
the interventional model is being scaled up to reach tens of
millions of people in Southeast Asia and Latin America over the
next few months.
You might be tempted to file this under “Duh”, but it’s essential to actually study things like this rigorously. It was just 18 months ago, at the outset of the pandemic, when the CDC and other health organizations were saying people shouldn’t bother with face masks.

                    <span>John Siracusa, on Twitter:
Sure, your “reader” app can include one (1) approved link to your
website … but will you be allowed to have any text near that link
explaining why someone might want to tap on it, or is that still
forbidden? This is where we are, mentally, when considering App
Store rules in 2021.
I have a friend who works at a company with a somewhat popular “reader” app that everyone has heard of, who says that internally, there’s a contingent that suspects Apple is going to require these apps to also offer Apple’s IAP to be allowed to include a link to their website.
That’s how much trust Apple has burned.
The spirit of Apple’s settlement with the Japan Fair Trade Commission is clear: these “reader” apps are going to be permitted to link users to their websites for signing up and buying media like e-books, movies, and music. Within that spirit, of course they’re going to be allowed to have text explaining this, and of course they’re not going to be required to also offer Apple’s IAP for these same purchases.
But very reasonable, smart people are genuinely skeptical that Apple is going to adhere to the spirit of this settlement.
Call me a fool, but I think Apple is going to follow through and do the right thing by these apps. There are a lot of negative adjectives that I’d apply to Apple regarding the App Store. Greedy, inconsistent, frustrating, shortsighted, capricious, technically illiterate. Did I say greedy? But one thing Apple is not and never has been is devious. Apple does not play tricks. And the JFTC would not take kindly to tricks.

In which, this time, the Flyers sign the contract *during* the show. 
 As the gang reviews the Sean Couturier contract after a week to let it settle in, the Flyers gave an extension to Joel Farabee and gave the show a whole new focus. Once that was out of the way the gang dove into the Flyers’ announcement that they’d be adding someone to the team’s Hall of Fame. Picks were made.</span>

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *In what was kind of a surprising bit of news on a late Thursday morning, the Flyers announced that they signed Joel Farabee to the AMac special, locking him up for his prime years. [BSH]
*Like we said it’s a pretty long term contract, so the Flyers are taking a gamble. Calculated, though. [NBC Sports Philly]
*Speaking of impressive youngster, Elliott Desnoyers out of Halifax had a heck of a camp. [Inquirer]
*Speaking of things we are less-than-impressed by, Travis Konecny had a bad year last year. No two ways about it. He’s going to need to be better to move this team forward. [BSH]
*And finally, put a bow on development camp AND get a great subscription deal by reading Charlie’s full analysis of what was what in the way only Charlie can. [The Athletic]</span>

Joe Blackburn and Justin Truman talk Trace Rifles, Gjallarhorn, and Exotic Catalysts
 A little more than a week after the Destiny Showcase, we know a lot more about The Witch Queen expansion and Year 5 of Destiny 2 than we did before. And in talking to game director Joe Blackburn and general manager Justin Truman last week, we’ve gotten new information on weapon crafting and glaives, raids, Hive Guardians, and the subclass reworks. But to round out our series of interviews, it’s time to talk about the lifeblood of Destiny: weapons. 
We spoke to the developer duo about if unique, Exotic-only weapons will stay Exotic forever, the limitations of Exotic Catalysts, and the return of Gjallarhorn.
Legendary trace rifles could be on the horizon

                    <span>In a recent episode of Apple TV+ series &quot;Ted Lasso,&quot; Jeremy Swift&#x27;s character Higgins briefly poked fun at actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney purchasing Welsh soccer club Wrexham AFC last year.





That led Reynolds and McElhenney to respond on Twitter with a humorous letter teasing legal action unless Apple sent over two large boxes of Ted Lasso biscuits.



Wrexham AFC today confirmed that Apple has followed through, sending 50 boxes of the famous Ted Lasso biscuits to players.




A man of his word, thanks @TedLasso! 
Better late than never, 50 boxes of forgiveness are gratefully accepted 🍪

In the TV series, titular character Ted Lasso won over AFC Richmond owner Rebecca Welton by giving her shortbread biscuits every day, which he baked himself.



The second season of &quot;Ted Lasso&quot; is currently streaming on ‌Apple TV+‌. Six episodes have aired so far, with a new episode coming each Friday.

                    <span>Apple has secured the global rights to &quot;The Fight Before Christmas&quot; documentary, which will premiere on Apple TV+ on Friday, November 26, reports Deadline.





The documentary tells the story of lawyer Jeremy Morris, who is obsessed with Christmas and planned the biggest community Christmas event in America. His Christmas plans hit a snag when the home owner&#x27;s association tells him his planned event violates neighborhood rules.



This leads to a man vs. HOA fight over the festivities, and the dispute snowballs out of control.
Produced by Dorothy Street Pictures, the doc follows the story of a North Idaho neighborhood turned upside down by one man&#x27;s obsession with bringing Christmas cheer to all, through the biggest community Christmas event America has ever seen. Christmas-loving lawyer Jeremy Morris&#x27; plan hits a snag when the home owners&#x27; association informs him that the event violates the rules of the neighborhood. A contentious fight over the festivities erupts and things snowball out of control. As the situation escalates, the film asks the question, who wins when different rights and interests collide? Director Read pieces together the polarized perspectives in this quirky Christmas tale about freedoms, with a message about differences and tolerance at its heart.
The film is directed by Becky Read, who produced &quot;Three Identical Strangers,&quot; a documentary about triplets who were separated at birth and adopted by different families.

For the 45mm model, the screen will measure in at 1.9 inches diagonally, up from 1.78 inches, and it will have a resolution of 396 x 484, up from 368 x 448, which equates to 16 percent more pixels. 



Bloomberg has not provided similar details for the 41mm model, but it too will see a comparable increase in body size, and both models will have slimmed down display borders.



The larger 45mm Apple Watch will have more space for complications, and Apple has multiple new watch faces in the works to …</span>

                    <span>Apple will not be able to avoid a proposed class action lawsuit covering Siri privacy claims, reports Reuters. The suit in question, which was initially filed in 2019, accuses Apple&#x27;s voice assistant ‌Siri‌ of violating user privacy.





The plaintiffs involved in the case can try to prove that ‌Siri‌ routinely recorded private conversations due to accidental activations, and that Apple disclosed those conversations to third parties such as advertisers, said the judge.



One user in the lawsuit claimed that his private discussions with his doctor about a &quot;brand name surgical treatment&quot; caused him to receive targeted ads for that treatment, while others said that their discussions about Air Jordan sneakers, Pit Viper sunglasses, and Olive Garden resulted in targeted ads.

                    <span>The iPad mini has been largely the same since it was first introduced in 2012. It&#x27;s had the same thick bezels and Home button across all five of its refreshes, but that&#x27;s set to change with the debut of the ‌iPad mini‌ 6.





Design


The ‌iPad mini‌ 6 will nix the Home button and adopt a design that&#x27;s similar to the iPad Air with a larger edge-to-edge display with slimmed down bezels that measures in at somewhere around 8.3 to 9 inches.



With no Home button, the ‌iPad mini‌ 6 is expected to get the same Touch ID power button as the ‌iPad Air‌, but it&#x27;s not yet clear whether it will get a USB-C port or continue to use Lightning. It could also include a Smart Connector for use with accessories like the Magic Keyboard.

Season two of &quot;Dickinson&quot; premiered earlier this year, and season three is set to premiere on Friday, November 5. In the third season, Emily Dickinson (played by Hailee Steinfeld) sees her productivity fall amid the American Civil War and a battle that divides her own family. She tries to heal the divide around her, wondering if art can keep hope alive and if the future can be better than the past.



&quot;Dickinson&quot; stars Toby Huss, Adrian Blake Enscoe, Anna Baryshnikov, Ella Hunt, Amanda Warren, Chinaza Uche, and Jane Krakowski will return, as will Wiz Khalifa, who plays Death. Guest stars will include Billy Eichner, Chloe Fineman, Zosia Mamet, Will Pullen, and more.

                    <span>A normal-looking Lightning cable that can used to steal data like passwords and send it to a hacker has been developed, Vice reports.



The &quot;OMG Cable&quot; compared to Apple&#x27;s Lightning to USB cable.


The &quot;OMG Cable&quot; works exactly like a normal Lightning to USB cable and can log keystrokes from connected Mac keyboards, iPads, and iPhones, and then send this data to a bad actor who could be over a mile away. They work by creating a Wi-Fi hotspot that a hacker can connect to, and using a simple web app they can record keystrokes.



The cables also include geofencing features that allow users to trigger or block the device&#x27;s payloads based on its location, preventing the leakage of payloads or keystrokes from other devices being collected. Other features include the ability to change keyboard mappings and the ability to forge the identity of USB devices.








The cables contain a small implanted chip and are physically the same size as authentic cables, making it extremely difficult to identify a malicious cable. The implant itself apparently takes up around half of the length of a USB-C connector&#x27;s plastic shell, allowing the cable to continue to operate as normal.



An x-ray view of the implanted chip inside the USB-C end of an OMG Cable.




The cables, made as part of a series of penetration testing tools by the security researcher known as &quot;MG,&quot; have now entered mass production to be sold by the cybersecurity vendor Hak5. The cables are available in a number of versions, including Lightning to USB-C, and can visually mimic cables from a range of accessory manufacturers, making them a noteworthy threat to device security.

According to a paywalled preview of a DigiTimes report, suppliers are scheduled to ramp up Apple Watch Series 7 production starting at the end of September. That timeframe could indeed reflect a short delay in production, as Nikkei Asia had reported that Apple Watch Series 7 mass production was originally slated to begin around mid-September.



It&#x27;s unclear if any production delay would affect launch timing of the Apple Watch Series 7. Apple has unveiled new Apple Watch models in September for five consecutive years, dating back to the Apple Watch Ser…</span>

                    <span>A long-time alternative to Apple&#x27;s Files app has been Documents, developed by Readdle. Today, the company is launching &quot;Documents X,&quot; intending to speed up everyday productivity tasks and offer users a refreshed design.





At the heart of Documents X is a feature Readdle is calling &quot;Smart Actions.&quot; Smart Actions are contextual actions that are recommended to users depending on an action they just took. For example, if a user uploads a file to Dropbox or Google Drive, the app may suggest that the user shares the link. If a user downloads a music video, they may get presented with a Smart Action to extract the audio from the video.





The number of Smart Actions is rather extensive and is built directly into the app without launching external apps or services to perform them. Readdle says all the actions are &quot;performed locally, which means that your files and activities don’t leave the device.&quot;





Documents X is also built on an updated design philosophy Readdle is calling &quot;FOCUS.&quot; FOCUS aims to reduce complexity for the in-app experience while maintaining a high level of attention to detail and simplicity. The new design includes updated colors, icons, menus, controls, and more that have been &quot;thoughtfully designed.&quot; 



Documents X can be downloaded from the App Store for free [Direct Link].

                    <span>Each Twitter Super Follow subscription is an individual in-app purchase for every account with the feature set up, it has emerged.



Screenshot from Jane Manchun Wong showing Twitter&#x27;s in-app purchases on its App Store page.


The unusual system, spotted by Jane Manchun Wong, means that for every Super Follow there is an individual in-app purchase for that account specifically. Some observers are speculating that each Super Follow in-app purchase will have to be set up manually by Twitter on the ‌App Store‌, making the system even more unconventional.



The ‌App Store‌ does not allow for multiple instances of the same subscription, leading other platforms such as YouTube and Twitch to get around this by effectively allowing users to buy a sub-token that can be directed toward a specific creator.



This means that there will be thousands of Twitter in-app purchases, dwarfing Twitter&#x27;s own Twitter Blue subscription and Ticketed Spaces, Twitter&#x27;s ‌App Store‌ page will only show 10 in-app purchases since it would be impractical to show the entire list.



Apple only allows developers to create up to 10,000 in-app purchases, so it is not clear if Twitter will limit the users eligible to sell Super Follows at 10,000 minus Ticketed Spaces and Twitter Blue.



Twitter announced Super Follows earlier this year, allowing creators with at least 10,000 Followers to charge up to $9.99 per month as a subscription for access to exclusive tweets. Twitter takes a three percent cut of Super Follow subscriptions up to a total of $50,000, making Apple&#x27;s 30 percent in-app purchase fee markedly larger.



The feature finally launched yesterday, starting in the United States and Canada, but it will be rolling out globally on iOS in the next few weeks.

                    <span>Apple is rumored to be in Asia visiting Toyota as it prepares to lay the supplier groundwork to mass produce a branded car by 2024, according to a new report by DigiTimes.





Apple representatives were said to have met with South Korea&#x27;s SK Group and LG Electronics last month to discuss Apple Car development, and now Japan&#x27;s Toyota is being touted as its next potential destination. 



Apple has been working on a car-related project since at least 2014, and at one stage it looked as if the company was scaling back to focus on autonomous vehicle software. However, following several changes in management and hiring, Apple is now believed to be focused on building a car for consumers.



But to do that, the company needs to tap into a whole new supply chain. Apple is expected to rely on a manufacturing partner to build the vehicles, and though it wants to make EV batteries in the United States, it may be seeking partnerships with established vehicle makers like Toyota to do so.



Reuters has previously reported that Apple is developing a new battery design that has the potential to &quot;radically&quot; reduce the cost of batteries and increase the vehicle&#x27;s range.



One person who spoke to Reuters described Apple&#x27;s &quot;monocle&quot; battery technology as &quot;next level&quot; and said that it&#x27;s similar to &quot;the first time you saw the iPhone.&quot;



Reuters&#x27; reporting claimed that Apple is aiming to begin production on an Apple-branded self-driving vehicle starting in 2024, so DigiTimes&#x27; focus on that date isn&#x27;t necessarily a shot in the dark. However, delays caused by the ongoing global health crisis or current chip shortage could always push production to 2025 or beyond.

                    <span>Eve today released an update to its latest version of the Eve Thermo that adds Thread support to the HomeKit-enabled smart radiator valve (via HomeKitNews).





The update fulfills a pledge the German company made late last year to bring Thread support to several products, and follows its inclusion in devices like the Eve Energy Smart plug (fourth generation), Eve Aqua (second generation), Eve Weather, and Eve Door &amp; Window (third generation).



As a quick explainer, Thread is a low latency and low power mesh-like network for smart devices. Unlike Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, the Thread standard doesn&#x27;t depend on a router or hub. Instead, the smart device itself extends the network by talking to other Thread-enabled devices, thereby boosting the signal between them.



Apple&#x27;s HomePod mini and the latest Apple TV 4K act as Thread border routers, and by adding Thread-supported devices around the home, users can typically expect improved connectivity compared to Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, a wider control range, and more remote scheduling options.



In related news, version 5.3 of the Eve app adds support for its upcoming HomeKit-enabled MothionBlinds, which are expected to launch sometime this year.

                    <span>Apple hopes to circumvent Samsung in the supply of components for a &quot;folded&quot; telephoto lens for 2023 iPhones, according to unnamed sources cited by Korean website The Elec.





The report claims Apple has approached Jahwa Electronics, which is part of Samsung&#x27;s supply chain, to supply an optical image stabilization module for the camera. Jahwa co-developed the technology with Samsung, which could cause Apple patent problems down the line. However, Apple likely has its own workaround for the patents or will end up paying a licensing fee to Samsung, according to the report. 



The Elec links these latest developments to iPhone models for release in 2023, but the outlet has previously claimed that Apple may use components made by Samsung for a &quot;folded&quot; telephoto lens on at least s…</span>

                    <span>Apple could be facing a widespread investigation into the App Store in India, and more specifically, the company&#x27;s in-app purchasing system, which grants it a 15% to 30% commission for all purchases made, reports Reuters.





The Competition Commission of India (CCI), which oversees cases of possible anti-competitive and antitrust behavior, is reviewing an antitrust challenge case against Apple presented by a non-profit Indian group. The group claims, in their case, that Apple&#x27;s standard 30% commission for in-app purchases &quot;hurts competition&quot; since it raises costs for both the developer and the customer. 

&quot;The existence of the 30% commission means that some app developers will never make it to the market ... This could also result in consumer harm,&quot; said the filing, which has bee…</span>

                    <span>Spotify has announced a new partnership with Delta that will see the streaming service take over the &quot;audio&quot; section of Delta&#x27;s in-flight seatback entertainment, making select playlists and podcasts freely available to all passengers.




You are now free to roam about the cabin—and get the music and podcasts you love at 30,000 feet. Beginning today, we&#x27;re taking off in a new partnership with Delta in which Spotify will take over the &quot;audio&quot; section of Delta&#x27;s in-flight seatback entertainment. This means passengers on Delta flights that are equipped with seatback entertainment globally can now enjoy their favorite audio content exclusively in-flight on Delta Studio. 
According to the press release, the free in-flight content is licensed directly by Delta and will include specially curated versions of Spotify&#x27;s most popular playlists, along with 42 select podcast series to choose from. 



In other words, not all Spotify content will be available, but passengers will be able to listen to playlists such as such as Mood Booster, Are &amp; Be, Hot Country, mint, Today&#x27;s Top Hits, Relax &amp; Unwind, RapCaviar, and Ultimate Indie. 



The first podcasts available will include Crime Junkie, Science Vs, StartUp, The Dave Chang Show, The Hottest Take, The Journal, and more.



Spotify says the update to Delta&#x27;s in-flight entertainment is rolling out now, with more content being updated regularly and more coming in October.

                    <span>Apple today announced that the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) has agreed to close its App Store investigation in exchange for changes to how &quot;reader&quot; apps like Netflix operate. Reader apps allow users to browse previously purchased content or content subscriptions for digital magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, and video.





Going forward, developers that create &quot;reader&quot; apps will be able to include an in-app link to their website for users to either set up or manage an account, and signup using a non-App Store payment method will be possible. Apple says that this change will be applied globally to all reader apps on the ‌App Store‌.

                    <span>This is actually big news from Apple:
Apple today announced an update coming to the App Store that
closes an investigation by the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC).
The update will allow developers of “reader” apps to include an
in-app link to their website for users to set up or manage an
account. While the agreement was made with the JFTC, Apple will
apply this change globally to all reader apps on the store. Reader
apps provide previously purchased content or content subscriptions
for digital magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, and video.
To ensure a safe and seamless user experience, the App Store’s
guidelines require developers to sell digital services and
subscriptions using Apple’s in-app payment system. Because
developers of reader apps do not offer in-app digital goods and
services for purchase, Apple agreed with the JFTC to let
developers of these apps share a single link to their website to
help users set up and manage their account. […]
“Trust on the App Store is everything to us. The focus of the App
Store is always to create a safe and secure experience for users,
while helping them find and use great apps on the devices they
love,” said Phil Schiller, Apple Fellow who oversees the App
Store. “We have great respect for the Japan Fair Trade Commission
and appreciate the work we’ve done together, which will help
developers of reader apps make it easier for users to set up and
manage their apps and services, while protecting their privacy and
maintaining their trust.”
Progress. Apple’s anti-steering provisions are the number one thing I have been clamoring to be changed in the App Store rules. I think this should expand beyond just “reader” apps, but one step at a time.
Do you hear that sound? That’s the sound of a significant amount of antitrust pressure being relieved from Apple.

                    <span>I released Acorn 7.1 yesterday, which has some new features, changes, and bug fixes. There&#x27;s nothing earth shattering in here, just another release that continually improves Acorn. The full release notes are available as always.
There is one little, yet devilish, bug fix in the 7.1 release. It took a while to track down and the fix of course was super easy.
Soon after the release of MacOS 11.5 I started getting crash reports. Lots of crash reports. They all had similar stack traces, pointing to something in the guts of Apple&#x27;s Key Value Observing code (_NSKeyValueObservationInfoGetObservances specifically).

                    <span>Allen Pike: The Persistent Gravity of Cross Platform
In practice, the tradeoff is about more than “cheap vs. good”. Unintuitively, sometimes native tech can actually be the cheapest way to achieve a certain goal, and sometimes cross-platform technologies actually lead to better products, even for very well-funded companies. So what is a useful way to think about the tradeoff?
Over the last decade I’ve talked to people at hundreds of companies about how they’re developing and supporting apps, helping them evaluate and plan native and cross-platform app work. While there are a lot of factors that go into this technology decision, there’s one that I think is particularly illuminating.
More and more apps written with web tech (such as Electron) are showing up on the Mac desktop everyday. I understand why, but I don&#x27;t have to like it.</span>

The young winger has one year left on his ELC.
 The Philadelphia Flyers just won’t stop making moves. I think Chuck Fletcher just likes being in the spotlight.
Announced by the team on Thursday, they have signed one of their most premium young players in Joel Farabee to a six-year, $30-million ($5-million AAV) extension. The 21-year-old still has one year remaining on his rookie contract, making this deal keep him in Philadelphia through the 2027-28 season.

But, he improved in other areas of his game.
 If one was expecting Travis Konecny to carry the momentum from the start of his 2020-21 season throughout the year, then you were sadly let down.
We can be forgiven for the optimism given Konecny’s habit to hit the ground running in NHL seasons, and with expectations on the Flyers high last year, it was appearing as if we could have a point-per-game TK on our hands. 


However, Konecny’s 2020-21 was streaky, and after his promising start, he went through large stretches of games with zero points. At times he disappeared and was barely noticeable on the ice, from a personal eye-test perspective.




Despite his streakiness, and penchant to go missing from games, 34 points in 50 games doesn’t c…</span>

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *That’s another Development Camp in the books, and now all we have to do is wait a couple of weeks for the big boys to hit the ice. The big finale was the 3-on-3 tournament, in which a couple of guys you expected to look good looked good. Which is good! [Flyers]
*The star of the show on day three was definitely front office newcomer Mike O’Connell, who has some really insightful things to say about the players he worked with. [BSH]
*Isaac Ratcliffe got the last word on the player blog’s front. Kid’s working hard. [Flyers]
*Ratcliffe has been a bit of a letdown since joining the Phantoms, but he’s hoping all that aforementioned hard work is going to get him back to the performance level we all expected when he was drafted. [Inquirer]
*The big winger owes a lot to the Flyers organization. Like, A LOT. And as a result, he really wants to succeed here. [NBC Sports Philly]
*With camp behind us and focus turning to the big boys, let’s talk about some young guys poised for a breakout this season. [BSH]
*Wednesday night Team Canada finally beat the US women at Worlds in an overtime thriller. Here’s how they finally did it. [The Athletic]
*And finally, it’s 25 Under 25 time! We’re going to roll through the 25 best players as quickly as we can before training camp starts, and we need you to tell us who those best 25 are. So get to voting. [BSH]</span>

Turn-based tactical gameplay for months
 A collection of Final Fantasy games are on the way to PlayStation Now, which allow players to stream the titles on their PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, or PC. The first game will be Final Fantasy 7 — the original version, which is still worth a spin, not the recent remake. Final Fantasy 7 will arrive on PlayStation Now on Sept. 7, and it’ll be followed by one new Final Fantasy game a month until some of the series’ best games are available to play.
The second game will be Final Fantasy 8 Remastered on Oct. 5, which is a turn-based tale of sweeping romance and worldwide war. Squall, Rinoa, and the rest of the SeeD gang are part of one of the most underrated Final Fantasies, and it’s nice to see more players having access to that tale. 
This is followed by Final Fantasy 9 on Nov. 2, which is still fondly remembered thanks to characters like Vivi, Garnet, and Zidane. In December, players get a two-fer with Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2 HD Remaster. Finally, on Jan. 4, 2022, Final Fantasy 12: The Zodiac Age will release on PlayStation Now, which is great because it has Balthier and Fran, who are some of the best party members in the entire franchise.</span>

Destiny 2 will also see a remaster of another original Destiny raid
 In addition to revealing that Destiny 2 players will get a new raid or dungeon every three months starting this December, Bungie recently announced that the legacy raid rotation will return. During its Destiny Showcase last week, the studio talked about the importance of that aspirational, pinnacle content for players. Convincing Destiny’s hardcore players to get together each week is a major priority, according to game director Joe Blackburn and general manager Justin Truman. Those incentives will take the form of the legacy raid rotation and yet another remastered raid from the original Destiny.

Meet Vex, the cutest lil goth
 League of Legends has tons of cute champions, including the fuzzy fae race known as Yordles. The next champion is Vex, the Gloomist, and she turns that trend on its head. This is one sad, emo little Yordle, and she’s got a big shadow friend to help her control the battlefield. Vex looks like a powerful mage who’s able to set up her abilities from range.
Riot hasn’t revealed the exact explanation and numbers behind her ability kit, but we see her use her shadow for getting around the map a little faster and setting up an initiation as the enemy team goes to kill the dragon.


We knew Vex was on the way, thanks to her presence in the Sentinels of Light lore event. Vex helped out the Ruined King, Viego, and it looks like she still has a little bit of a crush on the gloomy wife guy. She also wants to hang out with Amumu, the sad mummy with no friends, so she’s not all bad. Her debut skin also looks much more colorful, for players who find the dark color palette to be unappealing.</span>

I can have a little cosmic dread, as a treat
 A recent Dead Space panel came with a revelation: protagonist Isaac Clarke, who was speechless in the original game, would now be voice acted for the remake. It’s a relatively small change in the grand scheme of things, but it’s a point of contention for many fans. A voice protagonist is a tricky tool to use in horror, and some games use a little too much of it. 



Sometimes it works out OK, like Leon S. Kennedy in Resident Evil 4, who is fondly remembered for his great zingers like “Your right hand comes off?” But in The Medium, a recent horror title from Bloober Team, I could hardly hear myself think over protagonist Marianne’s musings. She kept leading me places while processing it aloud in real time, like someo…</span>

                    <span>Two of Apple&#x27;s self-driving cars operating in manual mode were involved in minor collisions in August, according to the California DMV.





The first incident [PDF] occurred in San Diego, California in the Hillcrest area on August 19. The Lexus RX 450h was stopped in traffic and was hit by a Hyundai. The accident was described as minor with no injuries.



The second accident [PDF] occurred on August 23 in Cupertino, California, right near the Apple Park campus. The vehicle with Apple&#x27;s self-driving equipment was in manual mode and it was stopped in traffic when it was rear ended by a Subaru Outback.



Both of these incidents were not the fault of the self-driving vehicle or the person operating the vehicle, and are largely not notable. What is interesting, though, is that Apple vehicles were involved in two collisions in the same month after no accidents since September 2019.



Earlier this year, the California DMV&#x27;s disengagement and mileage reports suggested that Apple&#x27;s Lexus SUVs with self-driving software traversed more than 18,000 miles in 2020, a steep increase compared to prior years. It&#x27;s possible that Apple has ramped up its testing in 2021, leading to a higher number of incidents.



Apple has been testing its self-driving software since early 2017, using the aforementioned Lexus RX 450h vehicles outfitted with sensors and cameras. The work on autonomous driving is part of Apple&#x27;s longtime car project, and rumors suggest Apple is planning to release a vehicle in the mid to late 2020s.

                    <span>Twitter today announced the official launch of Super Follows, a new feature that allows creators to provide subscriber-only content that requires a paid fee to access.





First introduced in February, Super Follow is another method that Twitter is using to monetize tweets and provide content creators with a way to earn money on the platform.



Creators who use the Super Follow feature on Twitter can charge $2.99, $4.99, or $9.99 per month to allow their subscribers to access exclusive tweet content. According to Twitter, creators are eligible to keep up to 97 percent of revenue until a $50,000 threshold is reached, and after that, creators will earn up to 80 percent of revenue after in-app purchase fees.



Twitter says that Super Follows are designed for anyone that brings &quot;unique perspectives and personalities&quot; to Twitter to drive public conversation.



At the current time, Super Follows are available to a small group of U.S. content creators that applied to participate, but people can apply to join the waitlist to set up a Super Follows subscription. 10,000 or more Twitter follows are required.



Those interested in subscribing to an account that offers Super Follows can tap on the Super Follow button on an account&#x27;s profile to see pricing details. Super Follow is limited to the U.S. and Canada at the current time, but it will be rolling out globally on iOS in the next few weeks.

                    <span>Apple today released a new update for Safari Technology Preview, the experimental browser Apple first introduced in March 2016. Apple designed the ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ to test features that may be introduced into future release versions of Safari.





‌Safari Technology Preview‌ release 131 includes bug fixes and performance improvements for Web Inspector, CSS, Web API, JavaScript, Platform Features, Media, Web Audio, WebRTC, Payment Request, WebCrypto, Accessibility, and Rendering. Apple warns that Tab Groups do not sync in this release.

Employees have been asked to voluntarily share whether they have been vaccinated by mid-September, and this applies to both employees working in an office and those working remotely.

                    <span>Twitter today announced that it is testing a new feature called Safety Mode, which is designed to cut down on harassment and unwelcome interactions on the social network.





Users who often get unwanted, spammy, or abusive replies to their tweets can turn on Safety Mode, which will autoblock accounts that use harmful language like insults, or send repetitive, uninvited replies and mentions.



Twitter says that Safety Mode assesses the likelihood of a negative engagement by considering the Tweet&#x27;s content and the relationship between the Tweet author and replier. People blocked by Safety Mode will be unable to follow your account, see your Tweets, or send Direct Messages.




Introducing Safety Mode. A new way to limit unwelcome interactions on Twitter. pic.twitter.com/xa5Ot2TVhF
— Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) September 1, 2021
 


With Safety Mode, the autoblock stays on for a minimum of seven days, and autoblocked accounts are listed in the Safety Mode interface. Accounts that a person follows will not be autoblocked.



To develop Safety Mode, Twitter consulted trusted partners with expertise in online safety, mental health, and human rights.
We want you to enjoy healthy conversations, so this test is one way we&#x27;re limiting overwhelming and unwelcome interactions that can interrupt those conversations. Our goal is to better protect the individual on the receiving end of Tweets by reducing the prevalence and visibility of harmful remarks.
Twitter is testing Safety Mode with a small group of people at the current time and will expand the testing group as feedback is received. During the beta testing period, Twitter says it will incorporate improvements and adjustments before releasing the feature for all users.

                    <span>After unveiling its latest Pixel 6 smartphones with a custom Arm-based Google Tensor chip last month, Google is also developing its own Arm-based processors for future Chromebook laptops and tablets, according to Nikkei Asia. 





Google plans to roll out its own processors for Chromebooks in around 2023, according to the report. Chromebooks are laptops, tablets, and detachable devices that run Google&#x27;s Chrome OS operating system, and they are available from brands such as Google, Samsung, Lenovo, Dell, HP, Acer, and ASUS in several markets.



The report claims that Google was particularly inspired by Apple&#x27;s success in developing its own chips for not only iPhones, but also Macs following the introduction of the Apple-designed M1 chip last year. The first Macs with Apple silicon chips were released in November 2020 and Apple previously said the transition away from Intel-based processors for its Mac lineup would take about two years to be completed.



The latest Mac to transition to Apple silicon is the base model iMac, which was updated with the M1 chip, a colorful new design, and a larger 24-inch display in April. Apple is also rumored to be planning redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with a faster version of the M1 chip for release later this year, with multiple reports having stated the notebooks are likely to be released in October or November.

Version 8 of the popular messaging platform uncaps the previous live stream audience limit of 1,000 viewers for groups and channels, and includes more customization options when forwarding messages, plus a shortcut to switch between channels.



The change makes the previous update that brought group video calls all the more powerful for live broadcasts. &quot;The power to run your own TV station is here, right in your pocket,&quot; says Telegram in a blog post, underlining the possibilities.



When forwarding messages, there&#x27;s a new option to remove captions, and sender names can now be hidden. Meanwhile, at the bottom of a text channel, there&#x27;s a new option to quickly swipe up and jump to the next unread channel.



This update also makes stickers easier to find, with trending stickers now shown above the &quot;Recently Used&quot; sticker panel, and there&#x27;s now an unread messages counter in comment threads.



Telegram is a free download for iPhone and iPad from the App Store. [Direct Link]

                    <span>Apple has returned to in-person Today at Apple sessions in its retail stores in Europe, including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Turkey, and Brussels, offering local communities a chance to gather once again to learn, collaborate, and explore the world of Apple&#x27;s devices and services.





Apple, due to the global health crisis, halted in-person Today at Apple sessions last year. The company was originally hoping to return to normalcy in its stores in the United States on August 30; however, concerns regarding the health and safety of staff and customers pushed the company to delay the return to in-person Today at Apple sessions. 



In replacement of in-person sessions, Apple has been producing and publishing Today at Apple sessions for YouTube, ranging from photography to drawing and art. Apple customers in Europe can now reserve and participate in Today at Apple sessions by checking the website for date, time, and availability for their local store. 



Apple says that it will ask all participants, including kids, to wear a mask, adhere to social distancing, and additional health and safety measures based on local conditions.

                    <span>On Tuesday, Nikkei Asia published a report claiming the upcoming Apple Watch Series 7 will feature blood pressure measurement capabilities, and that this is one of the reasons why production of the device has hit snags as manufacturers adjust to the more complex design. 





Later the same day, Bloomberg cited its own sources corroborating Nikkei&#x27;s main claim that the new model had brought manufacturing challenges which could lead to supply constraints or shipment delays, but the subsequent report by Debbie Wu and Mark Gurman made no mention of Nikkei&#x27;s claim about a blood pressure sensor being one of the causes of the production snags.



However, if there was any doubt, Gurman has now put to bed Nikkei&#x27;s key assertion in a tweet, saying that there&#x27;s &quot;no chance&quot; the Apple Watch…</span>

                    <span>Google is rumored to be working on a new wireless charging stand that could deliver 23W of charging power to its upcoming Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro phones, according to a leaked inventory image published by Android Police.

If true, that would beat the iPhone 12&#x27;s maximum 15W wireless charging speed (or 12W on ‌iPhone 12 mini‌) using Apple&#x27;s MagSafe charger, and would be another one-up for the Pixel 6 phones, which are already shaping up to be a respectable rival to the upcoming iPhone 13 expected to launch this month. 



With a ‌‌MagSafe‌‌ charger and Apple&#x27;s 20W power adapter or another appropriate 20W+ PD 3.0 charger, it takes about an hour to charge an ‌‌iPhone 12‌‌ from zero to 50 percent, which is double the time that it takes to charge using a…</span>

                    <span>Starting today, the popular Philips Hue smart lights will feature a deep integration with the Spotify streaming music service, allowing Hue users to sync their lights to their Spotify playlists.





The Philips Hue system will use an algorithm to analyze the metadata of each song in real time to make Hue lights flash, dim, brighten, and change colors while matching with the beat, mood, genre, and tempo of music on Spotify. The algorithm even takes into account factors like loudness, segments, pitch, and more.



With the Sync tab in the Philips Hue app, users can personalize the Spotify integration experience. There are tools for starting and stopping the sync, changing the brightness and intensity of the lights, and choosing a palette to change the colors of the lights.

                    <span>James Wan‘s heralded return to horror, Malignant, releases on September 10, in theaters and HBO Max, but much of it remains shrouded in mystery.

The new rules will only allow gaming platforms to offer services

Folks ... it is back.
 The last time we did an update to our periodical, often-twice-a-year-but-sometimes-less Philadelphia Flyers Top 25 Under 25 series here at BSH, it was in March of 2020, when the NHL had just hit pause on its regular season due to COVID and we thought hockey was going to be back pretty soon and things would be normal before we knew it. And that’s exactly what happened!
(/does the thing where you put your finger to your ear to pretend you’re getting an important update on an earpiece)
Ah. I’m hearing that that’s not actually what happened. I hate it here.
Anywho! It’s been so long since we last did this that the Flyers have brought on not one, but two draft classes since then. Nine of the players in the Top 25 the l…</span>

Another development camp check-in. 
 We’re still rolling through development camp, and the yesterday saw the players pretty much wrapping up the drills focused portion of camp, before we move into the 3-on-3 tournament this afternoon. After the day’s sessions, we caught up with one of the organization’s newcomers in Mike O’Connell (Senior Advisor to the General Manager/Player Development), as well as a couple of players in Samuel Ersson, Isaac Ratcliffe, and Mason Millman. They were a chatty bunch, so we’ll avoid going on for a million years here and just run through the highlight reel.

On Isaac Ratcliffe, and if anyone in particular has surprised him at camp. 
Well, I’ll get to Isaac first. He’s big guy, for sure. Again, I’m just getting to know…</span>

The youth movement has been somewhat halted — but there’s still plenty of breakout potential in this group of youngsters. 
 After scoring just eight goals in 52 games during his rookie season, Joel Farabee exploded with a 20-goal, 38-point campaign in 2020-21 — which begs the question of which Flyer is poised to backup Farabee’s breakout with one of their own in 2021-22.
Given that Flyers GM Chuck Fletcher was aggressive in moving out younger players that traditionally fall into the breakout mold ala Farabee in favor of better veterans to improve the team in the short-term, there are significantly less options to choose from during this exercise.
That said, the Flyers still have some intriguing young talent in the pipeline that are certainly ski…</span>

 Marvel’s Midnight Suns is the next turn-based game from the team behind XCOM. Lead designer Jake Solomon was on hand today during a Twitch livestream hosted by IGN to detail the game’s card-based combat system.
The combat was the biggest reveal from the stream, which included a six-minute sequence of heavily edited gameplay. It showed a hand of cards positioned along the bottom of the user interface, right about where XCOM’s ability hotkeys lived in the past. The video went on to detail how those abilities are gained, upgraded, and combined with other heroes’ moves.

Hive Guardians are powerful new enemies in Destiny 2, and they’ll take some new strategies to kill
 For all of Bungie’s impressive tricks shown in the reveal of Destiny 2: The Witch Queen, the addition of Hive Guardians is likely the biggest. While monumental from a story perspective, Hive Guardians will also shape each fight in which they’re present. Like the Guardians that players control, Hive Guardians can use Supers, and they can resurrect — they can fight like us.
In an interview with Destiny 2 game director Joe Blackburn and general manager Justin Truman, we spoke about the challenges that Hive Guardians bring to the field.

Attack and defense are a little different on Fracture
 Valorant’s new map is its most unique so far. Fracture, which was officially announced on Wednesday, reverses attackers and defenders and makes both sides play a little differently than they’re used to. 
Fracture is shaped like a giant letter “H.” There are two bombsites on the map with the connecting section of the “H” in-between. While you might expect the middle section to be the attacker’s spawn, it’s actually the other way around. On Fracture, defenders start in the middle, leaving the spawn area to defend the sites on either side. Meanwhile, the attackers can pinch in toward the defenders from either side. To help make transitioning from one area of the map to another a little easier, there are also ziplines that run from one side to the other that run below the map.
Image: Riot Games
  
This represents a pretty massive change to the regular format for Valorant maps, which generally place defenders in positions that encourage more passive play, allowing attackers to push into them. However, on this map, the spawns mean that defenders are often put in the position to make the first move. 


Fracture also includes more lore than any previous Valorant map. The map features two mirror versions of reality, which is essentially the set up for the game’s larger story — and its explanation for why two versions of the same Agent might face off in a match. While we don’t know much about the world beyond its mirrored concept, there are interactable clues spread out around Fracture that should shed some new light on Valorant’s two realities. 
Image: Riot Games
  
Fracture is set to come to Valorant as part of the patch 3.05 update, which players should expect to arrive next week as part of the game’s new Act update. Valorant Episode 3 Act 2 is scheduled to drop around Sept. 9.

It’s a placeholder file, and mainly an Xbox Game Pass promotion
 If you’re an Xbox Game Pass subscriber, it looks like you can preinstall* Halo Infinite, a game launching a good three months from now.
(*You’ll be preinstalling what appears to be a 280.2 MB placeholder file, not a full build ready to play in the first minute of launch day or anything.)
Nonetheless, Halo fans and Xbox Game Pass subscribers took Microsoft up on the offer this morning, which right now isn’t much more than a preorder call to action. Halo Infinite launches Dec. 8 on Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X, and the preload offer verifies that it’ll be available the same day for Game Pass members, the same as Microsoft-published Forza Horizon 5, which also has a preloading option. The racing game launches Nov. 9.
Originally expected with the arrival of the Xbox Series X last year, Halo Infinite’s launch date was finally revealed a week ago at Gamescom. The game will arrive with a free-to-play multiplayer mode and a single-player campaign, but cooperative campaign multiplayer will have to wait for a post-release update. 
343 Industries’ Gamescom presentation made no mention of Halo Infinite’s campaign, which some fans found worrying. Infinite’s creative director followed up with a post the next day saying that the campaign is finished and feature complete, and that the developers are just busy finding and wiping out bugs and getting the game ready for release.</span>

Microsoft announces its first Xbox and PC games of September
 Xbox Game Pass subscribers will get a new slate of games in the first half of September, starting with Final Fantasy 13, the post-apocalyptic roguelike Nuclear Throne, and the absolutely ridiculous Surgeon Simulator 2. 
Along with those three, Microsoft is adding Craftopia, Breathedge, Signs of the Sojourner, Crown Trick, and The Artful Escape. Each of these games is coming to both console and PC, making this a packed couple of weeks for all of the service’s subscribers. 
Here’s what Xbox Game Pass subscribers should expect in the next few weeks: 
Craftopia (Cloud, Console, and PC) — Sept. 2
Final Fantasy 13 (Console and PC) — Sept. 2
Signs of the Sojourner (Cloud, Console, and PC) — Sept. 2
Surgeon Simulator 2 (Cloud, Console, and PC) — Sept. 2
Crown Trick (Console and PC) — Sept. 7
Breathedge (Cloud, Console, and PC) — Sept. 9
Nuclear Throne (Console and PC) — Sept. 9
The Artful Escape (Console and PC) — Sept. 9
On top of that, there are also three Quake titles, Quake, Quake 2, and Quake 3 Arena, which came to the service in late August. August also saw the additions of Myst, Twelve Minutes, Hades, Skate 3, and several other games to Xbox Game Pass, which are still available. 
Of course, there are also a few games leaving the service in September:

Red Dead Online (Cloud and Console)

Company of Heroes 2 (PC)
Disgaea 4 (PC)

Settlements and more arrive in 3.6 patch for No Man’s Sky
 Developer Hello Games gives No Man’s Sky players another free update with Frontiers, which introduces planetary settlements to the massive procedurally generated space exploration game. Hello Games likens the new settlements to the spaceport city of Mos Eisley from Star Wars, where intergalactic travelers can gather and grow their community.
No Man’s Sky’s new settlements, available Wednesday in patch 3.6, are tiny towns with NPC inhabitants, some of whom have their own problems. Players can help these settlements grow and even oversee them; Overseers can construct new buildings, solve citizens’ problems, make decisions, resolve disagreements, and provide security against threats.

                    <span>Apple today seeded a new public beta of the macOS 12 Monterey beta to public beta testers, allowing non-developers to test the new macOS Monterey software ahead of its public release. The updated beta comes just a day after Apple released the sixth macOS Monterey developer beta.





Public beta testers can download the macOS 12 Monterey update from the Software Update section of the System Preferences app after installing the proper profile from Apple&#x27;s beta software website.



‌macOS Monterey‌ introduces quite a few major updates for the macOS operating system. Universal Control, for example, lets a single mouse, trackpad, and keyboard be used across multiple Mac or iPad devices, and it&#x27;s now possible to AirPlay directly to a Mac from an iPhone, ‌iPad‌, or even another Mac.

                    <span>Twitter&#x27;s latest beta update introduces support for providing content creators with Bitcoin tips using the &quot;Tip Jar&quot; feature that Twitter introduced earlier this year. Bitcoin isn&#x27;t yet available to select as a tip option for beta users, but code in the beta suggests that Twitter is in the process of rolling it out.





When the Tip Jar was first introduced, Twitter allowed users to add Bandcamp, Cash App, Patreon, PayPal and Venmo links to their Twitter profile, but soon, there will be a Bitcoin option. The addition of a Bitcoin tipping option comes after Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey told investors in July that Bitcoin was important to the company and would be coming to the Tip Jar in the future.



Details in the latest Twitter beta indicate that users will be directed through a Bitcoin tutorial that includes details on the Bitcoin Lightning Network and custodial and non-custodial Bitcoin wallets.



Twitter gives Strike, Blue Wallet and Wallet of Satoshi as examples of custodial wallets and Muun, Breez, Phoenix and Zap as examples of non-custodial wallets. Twitter also informs users that a Strike account is required. &quot;We use Strike to generate Bitcoin Lightning invoices so you&#x27;ll need to connect your account to accept Bitcoin tips&quot; reads the text.



Twitter also appears to be working on &quot;Cheer,&quot; &quot;Haha,&quot; &quot;Hmm,&quot; &quot;Like,&quot; and &quot;Sad&quot; reactions to tweets that users will be able to activate using a press and hold gesture on the current like button.





Bitcoin support for tips is limited to the Twitter beta at this time and is not yet available for all beta users, so it is not yet clear when the Bitcoin feature will see an official release. There&#x27;s also no word just yet on when the new reactions will launch.

                    <span>Apple today released a revised version of the AirTags firmware that was first provided to ‌AirTags‌ owners last week. The new internal build number is 1A291c, up from 1A291a.





We don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s included in the new firmware and no new features were found following the first release, so it likely focuses on bug fixes and other under-the-hood improvements.



There is no way to force an AirTag update, as it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s done over-the-air through a connected iPhone. To make sure the update happens, you can put your AirTag in range of your ‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌, but you have to wait for the firmware to roll out to your device.



You can check your current AirTag firmware version using the Find My app, with instructions available in our how to.

                    <span>The popular endless hopper Crossy Road from Hipster Whale is coming soon to Apple Arcade. A release date has not been announced at this time, but users can sign up to be notified when the game becomes available through the App Store.





Similar to Frogger, Crossy Road tasks players with crossing a road bustling with traffic and obstacles, and there are many adorable characters to choose from, ranging from a chicken to a penguin. As with all games available through the service, the Apple Arcade version of Crossy Road will not have any ads or in-app purchases available.



Crossy Road was among the first games announced for the fourth-generation Apple TV alongside the introduction of the tvOS App Store back in September 2015. However, it appears the Apple Arcade edition of the game will be limited to the iPhone and iPad.



A variation of the game titled Crossy Road Castle, an endless runner/platformer combo, launched on Apple Arcade in February 2020.



Three additional games are set to launch on Apple Arcade this Friday, including Zen Pinball Party, MasterChef: Let&#x27;s Cook, and Layton&#x27;s Mystery Journey.



Priced at $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year, Apple Arcade provides access to a catalog of over 200 games without ads or in-app purchases across the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV, with additional titles added periodically.

                    <span>Apple today seeded the eighth beta of the upcoming watchOS 8 update to developers for testing purposes, with the update coming one week after Apple released the seventh watchOS 8 beta.





To install ‌‌watchOS 8‌‌, developers will need to download the configuration profile from the Apple Developer Center. Once installed, ‌‌watchOS 8‌‌ can be downloaded through the dedicated Apple Watch app on the iPhone by going to General &gt; Software update.



To update to new software, an Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery life, it must be placed on the charger, and it needs to be in range of the ‌‌iPhone‌‌. It&#x27;s not recommended to install ‌‌watchOS 8‌‌ on a main Apple Watch as the software may be unstable at this early date.

Developers can download the new tvOS 15 beta by downloading a profile onto the ‌Apple TV‌ using Xcode.



Apple shared little about tvOS 15 when it was unveiled, but there are some new features that are coming to the operating system. SharePlay, a FaceTime feature that lets multiple users watch TV shows or movies together, will integrate with tvOS, and there&#x27;s a new &quot;For All of You&quot; recommendation engine that suggests shows everyone might enjoy.



A Shared With You section also displays movies and shows that were shared with you through the Messages app so you remember to check them out. When paired with AirPods Pro or AirPods Max, the ‌Apple TV‌ supports Spatial audio for a theater-like surround sound experience, and there&#x27;s a new feature for automatically connecting your AirPods through Smart ‌AirPods‌ routing.



Hey Siri commands can be used to launch Apple TV+ shows, and two HomePod mini speakers can be paired with the ‌Apple TV‌ 4K for stereo sound. If you have HomeKit cameras, you can also now view multiple cameras at the same time on the ‌Apple TV‌.

                    <span>Nomad today announced the launch of the Base Station Mini with Magnetic Alignment, a small single-device charger designed for Apple&#x27;s iPhone 12 models.





The Base Station Mini with Magnetic Alignment features the same design as the original Base Station Mini, but it also includes integrated magnets that allow it to align more easily with MagSafe devices. This is not an official ‌MagSafe‌ accessory because ‌MagSafe‌ charging components need to be supplied from Apple and Apple has been slow getting the hardware to third-party companies.



As it is not using ‌MagSafe‌, the new Base Station Mini will charge an ‌iPhone 12‌ (and earlier iPhones) at a maximum of 7.5W, but it is a 15W charger so it can charge Qi-enabled Android smartphones more quickly. It is also compatible with AirPods and other Qi-based devices.



A USB-C cable comes along with it for charging purposes, and there&#x27;s a built-in light sensor that dims at night so it&#x27;s ideal for use on a night stand.



The Base Station Mini with Magnetic Alignment is available from the Nomad website for $69.95.

                    <span>Ahead of the theatrical release of James Bond film &quot;No Time To Die&quot; on October 8 in the United States, a 45-minute retrospective titled &quot;Being James Bond&quot; will be available to watch for free through the Apple TV app, according to Deadline.






The story from MGM is said to feature Daniel Craig reflecting on his 15 years playing Bond, with never-before-seen archival footage from his conversations with producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli. The retrospective will be available for free through the Apple TV app in over 30 regions from September 7 through October 7. 



Amazon in May announced it reached an agreement with MGM to acquire the entertainment company for $8.45 billion, following a report last year that claimed MGM had reached out to companies like Apple and Netflix to gauge interest in a potential acquisition. Amazon said it would help preserve MGM&#x27;s heritage and catalog of films, and provide customers with greater access to MGM&#x27;s existing works, such as the James Bond franchise.

                    <span>Android users are significantly less interested in the iPhone 13 models than they were this time last year in the iPhone 12 models, having been put off by the continued lack of a fingerprint scanner and concerns around child safety features, according to a new survey by SellCell.





The survey, conducted earlier this month, asked more than 5,000 current Android users in the United States aged 18 or over for their opinions about Apple&#x27;s upcoming products, revealing how the ‌iPhone 13‌ and Apple&#x27;s other expected products are viewed by customers of the rival platform ahead of their launch.



The survey found that 18.3 of Android users would consider switching to an ‌iPhone 13‌. This is a significant decline from last year when 33.1 percent of Android users were open to switching …</span>

                    <span>Kanye West&#x27;s latest album has achieved a new high for most streamed pop album of 2021 on Apple Music after its delayed release on Sunday (via Billboard). &quot;Donda&quot; set a record for the most streams in a 24-window on the service this year, pulling in over 60 million plays in the United States.





That makes &quot;Donda&quot; the third-most streamed album ever in the first 24 hours of a release. West&#x27;s album also topped ‌Apple Music‌&#x27;s top albums charts in 152 countries in the same time span, setting another record.



J Cole&#x27;s 2018 album &quot;KOD&quot; sits atop ‌Apple Music‌&#x27;s all-time debut chart with 64.5 million streams, followed by Drake&#x27;s &quot;Views,&quot; which courted around 63.5 million streams.



Following the arrival of &quot;Donda&quot; at the weekend, West claimed in an Instagram post that Universal, the parent company for Def Jam Recordings and West&#x27;s G.O.O.D. Music imprint, put the album out without his approval.



The album was originally supposed to arrive in late July, but West delayed it to August 6, then again to August 22, before the album eventually appeared on ‌Apple Music‌ and Spotify the following week.



West held a public listening party for the album on July 22 at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. Itended up breaking ‌‌Apple Music‌‌ livestreaming records with 3.3 million viewers tuning in. Even more ‌‌Apple Music‌‌ listeners participated in a second streaming event, which was held in Atlanta on August 5.

                    <span>South Korea today passed a bill that bans Apple and Google from requiring developers to use their own respective in-app purchasing systems, allowing developers to charge users using third-party payment methods,  The Wall Street Journal reports. 





The bill was originally supposed to be voted on yesterday, however, more urgent matters presented to South Korea&#x27;s National Assembly meant the bill was postponed. The bill is an amendment to the existing Telecommunications Business Act. It aims to ban Apple and Google from unfairly exploiting their market position to &quot;force a provider of mobile content, etc., to use a specific payment method.&quot;



Apple&#x27;s App Store has been under increased scrutiny in recent months. South Korea&#x27;s bill represents the first time any government has taken…</span>

                    <span>Three years after Apple released walkie-talkie functionality for the Apple Watch, Samsung has released a similar app for the Galaxy Watch 4 and Galaxy Watch 4 Classic. 





Samsung released the app via the Google Play Store, which was first spotted by XDA Developers. Similar to Apple&#x27;s own Apple Watch app, Samsung says its walkie-talkie app allows users to &quot;have instant conversations, just like if they were using a walkie-talkie.&quot; While the Apple Watch only allows two people to join in on a conversation, Samsung&#x27;s iteration allows for &quot;two or more users.&quot;



Samsung only lists the Galaxy Watch 4 and Galaxy Watch 4 Classic as compatible with the new app. Screenshots of the app on the Play Store reveal a similar interface to Apple&#x27;s walkie-talkie, featuring a large button to tap and hold to talk.

Development camp rolls on!
 Development camp is still rolling, and after the second day of on-ice activities, you guessed it, we had more player (and staff!) media availabilities. 
First up, we check in with Cara Morey, who’s the coach of the women’s team at Princeton and also serving as a guest coach for this camp, and then we hear from Tyson Foerster, Tanner Laczynski, and Linus Sandin. 
Cara Morey
On how the opportunity to join the staff for this camp arose. 
During the COVID year when our season was canceled, I spoke a little bit with Brent Flahr and had come into a couple meetings on analytics just to stay involved while our season was on hold. Then as development camp was approaching, they had asked if I’d like to come out and be a guest coach. That…</span>

Keyboard-and-mouse players grumble that their movement is nerfed across the board
 Apex Legends’ developers will patch out “tap strafing,” a form of player movement used mainly by PC gamers that allows them to make sharp turns to evade or counterattack less mobile opponents. Respawn Entertainment on Tuesday tweeted that the method would be eliminated with the next patch.
After much consideration and debate, we&#x27;ve decided to remove tap-strafing from @playapex in patch 10.1.
Our reasoning: It&#x27;s inaccessible, lacks readability/counterplay, and is exacerbated by movement abilities.
The next patch notes will include a…</span>

Crafting won’t be familiar, but Glaives will have that classic Bungie feel
 Weapon crafting will finally enter the Destiny universe in Destiny 2: The Witch Queen on Feb. 22, 2022. Bungie hasn’t revealed a great deal of information about this system just yet, but we spoke to Destiny 2 game director Joe Blackburn and general manager Justin Truman about how weapon crafting works, what it brings to Destiny, and the benefits of the crafting-only weapon: the glaive.
At last week’s Destiny Showcase, Bungie representatives referred to the crafting system as being “combat based,” but never gave a further explanation. In the original Destiny, weapons would drop for players with locked perks, and players would defeat enemies and spend resources to unlock a weapon’s full potent…</span>

The mode is set to launch on Oct. 12
 Hearthstone’s next game mode is Mercenaries, a turn-based RPG starring a tiny squad of Warcraft characters (and at least one non-Warcraft character). Players have a collection of Mercenary characters that they can pit against competing teams in both PvP and PvE modes. Blizzard will release Mercenaries on Oct. 12. 
Players will start with eight Mercenary characters and the main hub, a Village. The Village lets players manage their characters and base, then send their squad off on a procedurally generated Bounty run or a competitive match against another person. At launch, there will be over 50 Mercenaries, including the Lich King, Sylvanas, and Diablo (from the Diablo games, obviously). Completing the Mercenaries prologue also grants players a mouse mount in World of Warcraft.
There are three kinds of Mercenaries: Fighter, Caster, and Protector, which exist in a rock-paper-scissors system. Once players figure out their squad of three characters, they head into combat, which is turn-based. Each side picks their team’s actions, and then the round plays out. The format feels similar to Hearthstone’s Battlegrounds mode, with rounds split between decision making and action.
Hearthstone publisher Activision Blizzard faces wide-ranging allegations that it maintains a toxic workplace environment that is particularly hostile to women, pays them less, and subjects them to sexual harassment, and that perpetrators are not meaningfully punished, according to a lawsuit filed by California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing in July. You can read more about the allegations against Activision Blizzard in Polygon’s explainer. The lawsuit has caused many Warcraft fans to turn away from the franchise, with some using their remaining World of Warcraft game time to stage an in-game protest.</span>

Face of the Franchise’s nationally ranked teams, and Nebraska, stage alumni games through September
 The 10 college football programs that have participated in Madden NFL’s last two Face of the Franchise career narratives will cross over with Madden NFL 22’s Superstar KO mode, beginning Tuesday and running until Sept. 27.
The crossover means this is the first game where players can take a college football team into an online match against a friend since the dear departed NCAA Football 14 eight years ago. Superstar KO, a part of the game since Madden NFL 20, is a cooperative/competitive mode supporting teams of up to three players each; the matc…</span>

Online gala returns for a second year on Oct. 16
 DC Fandome, DC Entertainment’s streaming fan event, returns on Oct. 16. In the announced schedule, Warner Bros. Pictures promises a new trailer for The Batman, along with glimpses of other 2022 releases like Black Adam, The Flash, and Aquaman 2 (aka Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom). Along with the DC movies, the lineup promises new looks at upcoming comics, games, and animated projects.


Scheduled to make a second bow at DC Fandome are Gotham Knights, the Bat Family ensemble action game coming in 2022 from WB Games Montréal, and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, by Rocksteady Studios, makers of the highly acclaimed Batman: Arkham series of games.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(8 min)</span>
                    <span>China is implementing a new online gaming restriction that will affect children and teenagers who are under 18 years old, reports CNBC. Kids will only be able to play online games for an hour a day (8:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m.) on weekends and legal holidays. Weekday gaming is prohibited.





Companies that provide online game services to minors will need to comply with these rules and will not be able to offer the games to children outside of those hours. Gaming providers will also be required to have users register with their real names and users will need to be logged in to play. Gaming companies are responsible for ensuring minors are not accessing games outside of the permitted time.



The new rules are meant to safeguard children&#x27;s physical and mental health, and the National Press and Public Administration said that the guidelines address &quot;the problem of minors&#x27; excessive use&quot; of online gaming. China previously had a restriction that limited gameplay to 1.5 hours per day, but gaming was allowed on most days.



Tencent, a major gaming provider in China, said that only a small amount of its gaming revenue comes from younger players. The company plans to implement the new requirements, and earlier today, expressed support for the rules.



It&#x27;s not clear how these new rules will affect games that operate using the App Store. Apple Arcade is not a factor as it is not offered in China, but there are ‌App Store‌ games that require an online connection.



China in 2016 began requiring mobile gaming developers to officially license their games with the government, and in 2020, pressured Apple to remove ‌App Store‌ games from developers that did not comply. Apple has since pulled tens of thousands of games from the ‌App Store‌ in China.

The feature would also allow ‌iPhone‌ users to report crashes and other emergencies in areas where there is no cellular coverage.





There are at least two emergency features that will rely on satellite networks, and while satellite technology has been in the works for years, these capabilities are not likely to launch in 2021.



The first feature, Emergency Message via Satellite, is designed to let users text emergency services and contacts using a satellite network when there is no signal available, and it will be integrated into the Messages app as a third communications protocol alongside SMS and iMessage.

                    <span>Apple today seeded the sixth developer beta of macOS Monterey, the newest version of the macOS operating system. The sixth beta comes three weeks after Apple released the fifth macOS Monterey beta.





Registered developers can download the beta through the Apple Developer Center and once the appropriate profile is installed, betas will be available through the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences.



As with all new betas, Apple recommends not installing the new macOS update on a primary machine because it is early release software and could have bugs.



‌macOS Monterey‌ introduces Universal Control, a feature that lets a single mouse, trackpad, and keyboard be used across multiple Mac or iPad devices, plus there&#x27;s a new AirPlay to Mac feature.

                    <span>Over the weekend, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo sent out a research note suggesting that the iPhone 13 was &quot;likely&quot; to support low earth orbit satellite communication, a feature that would allow iPhone users to make calls and send messages when cellular and WiFi connections are unavailable.





In this note, Kuo said that Apple would use a &quot;customized&quot; Qualcomm X60 baseband chip that supports satellite communications. He also claimed that Apple would work with Qualcomm partner Globalstar on the basis that Qualcomm is implementing support for Globalstar&#x27;s n53 band in a future modem.



Almost immediately, mobile analysts and those with other expertise in mobile devices and communications began disputing Kuo&#x27;s report as inaccurate.

                    <span>Apple has inked a deal for &quot;Raymond and Ray,&quot; an upcoming movie that&#x27;s set to star Ewan McGregor and Ethan Hawke.





The film is about two half brothers who have lived together in the shadow of their father, but still have a sense of humor. After their father dies, they have a chance to reinvent themselves.
&quot;Raymond and Ray&quot; follows half-brothers Raymond (played by Ewan McGregor) and Ray (played by Ethan Hawke) who have lived in the shadow of a terrible father. Somehow, they still each have a sense of humor, and his funeral is a chance for them to reinvent themselves. There&#x27;s anger, there&#x27;s pain, there&#x27;s folly, there might be love, and there&#x27;s definitely grave-digging.
Alfonso Cuarón is set to produce, while Rodrigo García will direct. García is known for &quot;In Treatment,&quot; &quot;Albert Nobbs,&quot; and &quot;Blue.&quot;



&quot;Raymond and Ray&quot; will join other Apple films that include &quot;CODA,&quot; &quot;Emancipation,&quot; &quot;Killers of the Flower Moon,&quot; &quot;Sharper,&quot; &quot;The Tragedy of Macbeth,&quot; &quot;Finch,&quot; and others.

                    <span>Instagram today said that it is now requiring all Instagram users to share their date of birth to &quot;create safer, more private experiences for young people.&quot;





Instagram users who have not already provided their birthday to Instagram will be prompted to share it. Instagram plans to ask for date of birth when the app is opened up, and will provide notifications asking for the information a handful of times.



Users will be required to share their birthdays to continue using the Instagram app. Instagram also plans to place warning screens on certain posts and will ask for a birthday before allowing the content to be viewed. This is the same interface that&#x27;s already in place for sensitive or graphic posts, but it will also now require a date of birth confirmation.



The age information will be used to create new safety features, and it will help ensure that the &quot;right experiences&quot; are provided to the &quot;right age group.&quot; Back in March, Instagram introduced changes to prevent adults from sending messages to users who are under 18, and last month, began defaulting new accounts for users 16 and under to private.



Instagram is developing &quot;new systems&quot; to address people inputting the incorrect date of birth, using AI to estimate how old people are. Going forward, if someone selects an age and Instagram&#x27;s technology disagrees, the app will offer a menu of options for age verification.

                    <span>Apple today announced that it has acquired classical music streaming service Primephonic, and will be folding it into Apple Music.





Primephonic offers an &quot;outstanding listening experience&quot; with search and browse functionality optimized for classical audio, plus handpicked recommendations and &quot;contextual details on repertoire and recordings.&quot;
&quot;We love and have a deep respect for classical music, and Primephonic has become a fan favorite for classical enthusiasts,&quot; said Oliver Schusser, Apple&#x27;s vice president of Apple Music and Beats. &quot;Together, we&#x27;re bringing great new classical features to Apple Music, and in the near future, we&#x27;ll deliver a dedicated classical experience that will truly be the best in the world.&quot;
Apple says that with the Primephonic purchase, ‌Apple Music‌ subscribers will be provided with an improved classical music experience. This will start with Primephonic playlists and audio content, and in the coming months, Apple will offer a dedicated Primephonic experience with improved browsing and search capabilities by composer and repertoire, better classical music metadata, and more.



Primephonic will be taken offline on September 7, and is no longer available for new subscribers. Next year, Apple says it will launch a dedicated classical music app that combines Primephonic&#x27;s classical user interface with added features.



Current Primephonic subscribers will receive six months of ‌Apple Music‌ access for free with access to hundreds of thousands of classical albums that support Lossless and Spatial Audio.

                    <span>Hyper today announced the launch of a set of HyperDrive USB-C hubs that are designed for Apple&#x27;s 24-inch M1 iMacs, and the hubs are unique because they come with faceplates available in each iMac color.





The HyperDrive 5-in-1 Hub features two 5Gb/s USB-C data ports, two 5Gb/s USB-A data ports, and one 5Gb/s USB-A port that also offers 7.5W charging for small devices. It&#x27;s priced at $50.

Each hub is about 5 inches long and 1.5 inches wide, and they are designed to clamp to the front of the ‌iMac‌ by using one of the rear USB-C ports. The hubs are sold with seven color matching faceplates so you can choose the one that works with your ‌iMac‌.





Both of the new HyperDrive Hubs can be purchased from the Hyper website starting today.

                    <span>Apple will be donating to Hurricane Ida relief and recovery efforts on the ground after the devastating category four storm made landfall in Louisiana over the weekend, according to a tweet from Apple CEO Tim Cook.





&quot;Our thoughts are with everyone in Hurricane Ida&#x27;s path, especially those sheltering in Louisiana, and we&#x27;re grateful for the first responders who are helping keep communities safe,&quot; said Cook. He did not provide any further details about the donation plans, including how much money the company will be donating or to who and where the funds will be distributed.

Hurricane Ida made landfall near Port Fourchon, Louisiana on Sunday with 150 mph wind speeds, becoming the second most intense hurricane to strike the U.S. state, behind only Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The storm has caused extensive damage in parts of Louisiana and resulted in nearly one million people being without power in New Orleans and elsewhere.



Apple routinely donates to relief efforts following natural disasters around the world, such as hurricanes, floods, and wildfires.

                    <span>Tapbots today released version 6.3 of Tweetbot for the iPhone and iPad, with the key new feature being a &quot;Behaviors&quot; menu in the app&#x27;s settings that contains several toggle switches for fine tuning your Tweetbot experience. 





For example, while tapping the status bar in the Tweetbot app will bring you to the top of your timeline by default, users who dislike this feature can now turn it off in the &quot;Behaviors&quot; menu by toggling off &quot;Tap to Top.&quot;

Here&#x27;s everything in the &quot;Behaviors&quot; menu to start:
- Enable/Disable Tap to Top. By default, tapping the status bar will bring you to the top of your timeline. If this happens by accident and bugs you, you can now turn this feature off.

- Enable/Disable Drag &amp; Drop Tweets. If you always accidentally invoke the drag and drop feature and wish there was a way to turn that off, now you can!

- Enable/Disable Swipe to Switch Themes. Swiping up or down with two fingers normally switches to the next or previous theme. If this happens by accident far too often you can now turn this feature off.

- Enable the ability to Customize All Tabs. For years many of you have asked for the ability to customize all the tab buttons in Tweetbot. Well, finally you can now turn this option on and set your tab menubar exactly how you wish.

- Before, the short right swipe on a tweet gesture was configurable between liking or retweeting. Now you can also customize this gesture to open link to tweet, copy link to tweet, copy tweet text, add to reading list, or be disabled completely.
The latest version of Tweetbot also features additional iPad keyboard shortcuts, a new custom app icon, a new &quot;Harvest&quot; light theme, and more.

                    <span>South Korea has delayed voting on a bill that would ban Apple and Google from requiring developers to use their in-app purchasing systems, a move that would open the door to allowing third-party payment methods, representing a possible significant threat to Apple and Google&#x27;s app marketplace business models.





The bill, coming in the form of an amendment to the existing Telecommunications Business Act, was widely reported to have been voted on today. However, the National Assembly&#x27;s schedule and agenda lacked mention of the amendment, instead focusing on other bills on the press, economy, and more. A date for the assembly to vote on the bill has not yet been set.

                    <span>The government of Australia is considering creating new laws that could more heavily regulate digital payments systems such as Apple Pay, Google Pay, and WeChat Pay (via Reuters).





An Australian government-commissioned report into digital payments systems has made a number of recommendations, one of which suggested actively regulating ‌Apple Pay‌ and other similar digital payments services. Speaking to the Australian Financial Review, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said that the recommendations would be carefully considered:
Ultimately, if we do nothing to reform the current framework, it will be Silicon Valley alone that determines the future of our payments system, a critical piece of our economic infrastructure.




Under current Australian law, the likes of ‌Apple Pay‌ are not classified as payment systems, putting them outside payment regulations. Classifying ‌Apple Pay‌ as a payment system would clarify the regulatory status of digital wallets in Australia and allow the government to explicitly designate big tech companies as payment providers.



Other recommendations, contingent on classifying ‌Apple Pay‌ as a payment system, look to establish a strategy for the country&#x27;s wider payments ecosystem with a single, integrated licensing framework.



Australian banks such as the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia have previously raised concerns around the growth of digital wallets with &quot;competition issues&quot; and purported safety implications. Earlier this year, an Australian Parliamentary Committee considered forcing Apple to open up the iPhone&#x27;s NFC chip to support third-party payment systems in an effort to promote competition.

                    <span>Michiko Kakutani, writing for The New York Times:
In 1960, while working as an artist and graphic designer, and some
years before the Rolling Stones were born, Charlie Watts began
work on “Ode to a High-Flying Bird,” a captivating children’s
book about his hero, the jazz great Charlie Parker. The book
featured charming drawings of a bird named Charlie who realized he
didn’t sound like most of the other birds, and who left home to
fly to New York City, where he played “from his heart” and made a
new nest for himself in “Birdland.”
Charlie Parker made a 14-year-old Charlie Watts dream the
impossible dream of visiting New York and playing at a jazz club.
And while he thought at the time that “the only way to get to New
York was in a band on a cruise ship,” he would actually get there
in 1964 with the Rolling Stones. While Keith Richards and Mick
Jagger hung out at the Apollo, where James Brown was doing
five — five! — shows a day, Mr. Watts spent his free time
haunting the jazz clubs he’d dreamed about as a boy: He saw
Charles Mingus at Birdland, Gene Krupa at the Metropole, and Sonny
Rollins, Earl Hines and Miles Davis.
Lovely memorial, with some great quotes from his bandmates.

It’s quote roundup time!
 At long last, development camp is here! The Flyers kicked off their on-ice sessions yesterday, and we were able to check in with some of the prospects for the first time in a few months, or in some cases, the first time ever. And with those first looks of the players on the ice, we also got to hear from a handful of the players to get some insight into their mindsets and goals heading into camp. Let’s check in with Egor Zamula, Wade Allison, Morgan Frost, Cam York, and Same Tuomaala, shall we?

                    <span>Pick up your paintbrush
 Hayao Miyazaki’s influence is seen beyond film, and in games across the entire industry. But never before have I felt as if I was playing inside of a Studio Ghibli film until my hourlong experience with Behind the Frame: The Finest Scenery.
Created by Taiwanese developer Silver Lining Studio, Behind the Frame is mostly a short, interactive-fiction game about a painter finishing a last piece of artwork before submitting it to a gallery in New York.
Behind the Frame takes place in the painter’s lush studio apartment over the course of a few  days as she slowly works her way through the painting. It’s easy to get pulled into the Ghibli-like style and animation, which is set to a soft, “lo-fi”  soundtrack. Painting happens leisurely: a stroke of yellow here, a swath of…</span>

Also fight off a horde of dangerous Sesame Street characters
 The moment I saw Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator I fell in love with how each organ pulses and writhes. In the game, you play as a powerful alien overlord, buying and selling organs. While you’ll spend plenty of time in the market, you’ll also get to choose what to do with those organs and who you kill for them.

Bungie doesn’t want players to feel like they’ve had abilities taken away in The Witch Queen
 At its Destiny Showcase last week, Bungie revealed that Destiny 2’s old Light subclasses will get the Stasis treatment, starting in The Witch Queen expansion and continuing throughout Year 5. While players seem to universally prefer to the less rigid Stasis upgrade path to the original Light ones, players may have had some concerns about what they might lose in the conversion. But in an interview with Polygon, Destiny 2 game director Joe Blackburn and general manager Justin Truman allayed those fears. 
“There are no plans right now, for us, for players to lose anything substantial in the conversion,” said Blackburn. “If you’re talking about something like Nova Warp, or if y…</span>

No more Conduit Energy, and switch Covenants without limitation
 World of Warcraft’s Shadowlands update 9.1.5 will roll out in the game’s public test realm this week, bringing with it a raft of player-requested and suggested changes, as well as new efforts to curb toxic behavior and sanction players who don’t get the message.
The 9.1.5 content update closely follows the 9.1 patch, which launched in June, four months after it was first announced. The 9.1 update was the first big content patch for World of Warcraft: Shadowlands since the expansion launched in November. The newest patch will allow players to switch Covenants without restriction (including the use of their cosmetic rewards), and will remove the Conduit Energy system, which was effectively…</span>

Motive Studio will discuss development in surprise stream
 Electronic Arts and developer Motive Studio will give Dead Space fans a “very early look” at the development of the sci-fi horror game’s remake on Tuesday. That sneak peek will be streamed on Motive’s Twitch channel on Aug. 31 at 1 p.m. EDT/10 a.m. PDT.
Given the language used in EA’s tweet — a “very early look at the development” — it’s unclear just how much we’ll see of the new Dead Space itself. EA and Motive didn’t promise a trailer or gameplay, so set your expectations accordingly. (EA hasn’t even announced a release window for the new Dead Space yet.)

The game was in beta for two years
 Lego Star Wars Battles, a mobile real-time strategy game that was shut down in July, is getting re-released as an Apple Arcade exclusive. The game was soft-launched in a few countries in 2019, and its servers were shuttered in 2021.
Developer TT Games Brighton announced the relaunch on Monday. The studio did not give an exact release date, saying only that the game is “coming soon.” Lego Star Wars Battles’ servers were unceremoniously shut off earlier this year, with players notified in advance via an in-game message.
“We are sorry to say that LEGO Star Wars Battles will be closing,” TT Games Brighton announced in May. The studio instructed players to use any remaining in-game currency before the game was taken offline on July 1. Media and Lego Star Wars Battles players took the shutdown to mean the game was canceled.
Polygon has reached out to publisher Warner Bros. Games for more information.
Soon to be available as an Apple Arcade exclusive, Lego Star Wars Battles will require a subscription. Games on Apple’s service are playable with a $4.99-a-month fee, which lets players access more than 150 titles. The games are ad-free, but playable only as long as a subscription is active. Sometimes, Apple Arcade exclusives will later receive a console or Windows PC release after some time.
Lego Star Wars Battles spans the franchise, but most importantly, there are porgs.</span>

                    <span>Steal some crypto for the resistance in Watch Dogs: Legion
 Watch Dogs: Legion now has heists. Well, at least one heist. In a new crossover event between Legion and Netflix show Money Heist, players can group up with friends to steal cryptocurrency from Clan Kelly — one of the game’s enemy factions. 
Players and up to three other friends can roll up to the Bank of London starting Monday in Watch Dogs: Legion. The group will take on Clan Kelly, some guards, and a powerful firewall while wearing the signature jumpsuits from Money Heist, as well as some Guy Fawkes-esque masks covering their faces. 
The trailer shows players sneaking through the bank at night, incapacitating guards with their buddies. But if going loud is more your style, the group will also have shotguns, pistols, and other weapons to keep guards and Clan Kelly on the backfoot. Once the heist crew has secured the crypto, it’s time to ride a drone in the night across the River Thames to make their escape.
Groups that complete the new Money Heist mission will unlock a new outfit for their recruits. 
This isn’t Legion’s first major crossover event this month, with several new, modern-day Assassin’s Creed missions appearing in the game last week alongside update 5.5.</span>

                    <span>Samsung Display today announced that it has started mass production of 14-inch and 16-inch OLED displays for laptops, and a key feature of the panels is support for up to a 90Hz refresh rate for smoother appearing content.





Samsung Display said it has been supplying the OLED panels to global manufacturers, including ASUS, Lenovo, Dell, HP, and Samsung Electronics, for use in laptops, including ASUS&#x27;s recently announced Zenbook and Vivobook Pro laptops. Apple was not mentioned as being a customer, but Korean website The Elec last month reported that Samsung Display was preparing its production lines for future MacBooks with OLED displays, and DigiTimes has said Apple plans to launch a 16-inch MacBook Pro with an OLED display in 2022.

                    <span>Just a day after the iPhone 13 models were announced by Apple, the first Geekbench score has already surfaced. Someone has benchmarked the GPU performance of the iPhone 13 Pro, and there&#x27;s a significant performance increase compared to the prior-generation iPhone 12 Pro.





The ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌, or iPhone14,2, earned a Metal score of 14216, a 55 percent increase compared to the 9123 Metal score earned by the ‌iPhone 12 Pro‌.





Apple&#x27;s ‌iPhone 13‌ models feature an A15 chip with 6 CPU cores, including two performance cores and four efficiency cores. Both the ‌iPhone 13‌ and ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ devices have the same CPU, but there are differences when it comes to GPU. The ‌iPhone 13‌ and 13 mini are equipped with a 4-core GPU, while the higher-end ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 13 P…</span>

                    <span>Apple is facing a new class-action lawsuit in the United States that accuses it of false or deceptive marketing for the M1-powered MacBook Pro and MacBook Air, fraudulent business practices, misconduct in customer support, and violation of consumer law.





The lawsuit, filed this week in the Northern District of California, represents Apple customers across the United States who have faced hardware defects in their M1 MacBook Pro and ‌MacBook Air‌.



Over the last several months, a significant number of customers have reported that the displays on their new Apple silicon MacBooks have suddenly cracked or displayed black horizontal and vertical lines, making them unusable. As the lawsuit alleges, those customers said that the cracks and malfunctions were caused by a hardware de…</span>

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Apple CEO Tim Cook is one of the 100 Most Influential People of 2021 according to TIME&#x27;s newly published rankings. TIME shares an annual list highlighting world leaders, celebrities, tech company executives, authors, musicians, athletes, and more, and this is not the first time Cook has been celebrated.





This year&#x27;s list is broken up into categories that include Icons, Pioneers, Titans, Artists, Leaders, and Innovators. Cook is listed in the &quot;Titans&quot; category alongside Shonda Rhimes, Tom Brady, Timbaland and Swizz Beats, Simone Biles, and others.



Cook&#x27;s profile was written by Nike co-founder Phil Knight, who reflected on his relationship with Cook and his talks with Cook as a Nike board member. According to Knight, Cook is a man of &quot;wisdom&quot; and &quot;excellent judgment.&quot;
One of his most difficult challenges was the change of leadership at Apple after Steve Jobs passed away, the Steve Jobs who was beloved and recognized around the world as a genius.



This almost impossible transition was handled with amazing dignity and grace, and announced to the world in his own quiet way: &quot;I am not the second Steve Jobs. I am the first Tim Cook.&quot;



And by the way, in the 10 years since... Apple stock has gone up 1,000%, making it the most valuable company in the world.
Other notable names who made this year&#x27;s list include Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, Naomi Osaka, Billie Eilish, &quot;Ted Lasso&quot; star Jason Sudeikis, Joe Biden, and Elon Musk.



Earlier this year, Apple was listed as one of TIME&#x27;s 100 Most Influential Companies of 2021 thanks to its record breaking holiday quarter and ever increasing product lineup.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/15/airtags-firmware-available-to-all-users/">

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Apple this week continued distributing new firmware for the AirTags that first rolled out in August. There have been several minor releases with different build numbers, and behind the scenes, those tweaks were to meter the number of people who were seeing the AirTag update at one time.





The last version, for example, with a build number of 1A291e changed nothing other than the rate limit on the percentage of ‌AirTags‌ users getting the update. That update set the limit to 25 percent, and another build released yesterday (1A291f) removes the deployment limit entirely, so all users should now be able to get the firmware update.



A portion of people will have already received the new firmware, but anyone who had not should see their ‌AirTags‌ updating over the next few days. There&#x27;s still no word on what&#x27;s included in the ‌AirTags‌ firmware, and no new features have been found so it likely focuses on bug fixes and other under-the-hood improvements.



It is not clear why Apple has metered the release of the ‌AirTags‌ firmware update, but it may have to do with the over-the-air distribution method.



Apple does not provide an option to force an AirTag update, as it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s done over-the-air through a connected iPhone. To make sure the update happens, you can put your AirTag in range of your ‌‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌‌, but you have to wait for the firmware to roll out to your device.



You can check your current AirTag firmware version using the Find My app, with instructions available in our how to.

                    <span>Apple this week introduced a redesigned sixth-generation iPad mini that looks much closer to the current iPad Air, with slimmer bezels, a Touch ID power button, a USB-C port, compatibility with the second-generation Apple Pencil, and more.





The new iPad mini is equipped with the same A15 Bionic chip as iPhone 13 models, and while Apple doesn’t advertise the amount of RAM in the device, MacRumors can confirm that the new iPad mini has 4GB of RAM, an increase from 3GB of in the previous iPad mini. We can also confirm the ninth-generation iPad has the same 3GB of RAM as the eighth-generation model. These amounts were revealed in strings contained within the Xcode 13 beta.



For comparison, the iPad Pro is available with up to 16GB of RAM depending on storage capacity, while the latest iPad Air has 4GB of RAM.



The same type of Xcode strings accurately revealed the amount of RAM in iPhone 12 models last year and in several previous iPhone generations. Teardowns and regulatory filings should provide further confirmation in the coming days.



The new iPad mini and iPad models are available to order now on Apple&#x27;s website and launch on Friday, September 24.

Apple announced the Apple Watch Series 7 during its event yesterday, but the watch will not be available until &quot;later this fall.&quot; As a result, Apple has so far offered relatively little detail about the new watch, not even publishing a specifications page on its website detailing the specific features of the Series 7.

                    <span>With the upcoming launch of new iPhones, we&#x27;re starting to see accessory companies introduce cases for the latest Apple smartphones. Nomad today announced its own iPhone 13 cases and Apple Watch bands, all of which can be pre-ordered today.





All of the new ‌iPhone 13‌ cases from Nomad include a new feature called the Digital Business Card. With this, you can customize a digital card that includes your phone number, name, social media, and other information, and it&#x27;s all stored within an NFC-enabled chip in the case. This way, another iPhone user can simply tap the back of your ‌iPhone‌ and receive all of your information.

These amounts are unchanged from the iPhone 12 lineup.

iPhone 13 models feature a more power efficient A15 Bionic chip based on TSMC&#x27;s advanced 5nm+ process, but Apple has not indicated how much faster the chip is compared to the A14 chip. The A15 chip also has a new 5-core GPU in iPhone 13 Pro models — up from 4 cores — that Apple says delivers the &quot;fastest graphics performance in any smartphone.&quot; 



All four iPhone 13 models will be available to pre-order starting Friday, September 17 at 5 a.m. Pacific Time in the U.S. and over 30 other countries and regions. The devices are set to launch one week later on Friday, September 24.

                    <span>While third-generation AirPods were not announced at the Apple Event this week, suppliers have already kicked off shipments of the long-awaited headphones, according to industry sources cited by Taiwanese website DigiTimes. 





In a paywalled preview of its report, DigiTimes said the shipments have been &quot;slow,&quot; but production being underway is a good sign that the third-generation AirPods will likely be released before the end of the year. There will likely be another Mac-focused Apple Event this year, and the new AirPods could be unveiled then, or they could be announced with a press release through the Apple Newsroom at any point this fall.



The third-generation ‌AirPods‌ are expected to feature a design language similar to the ‌AirPods Pro‌, but without active noise cancellation. However, rumors have conflicted as to whether the new design will include silicone ear tips.



The second-generation AirPods were released in March 2019, priced at $159 with a wired charging case or $199 with a wireless charging case.

AppleCare Guide: Is it Worth Paying For?

                    <span>Following the announcement of the iPhone 13, Apple Watch Series 7, and the new sixth-generation iPad mini, Apple gave YouTuber iJustine a chance to talk to Apple CEO Tim Cook about the new announcements, including some tidbits about Fitness+.







In the nearly 15 minutes&#x27; long interview, Cook describes the new camera features of the ‌iPhone 13‌, specifically Cinematic Mode, as a &quot;mindblowing&quot; addition to the iPhone that places it on par with professional high-end video equipment. The interview doesn&#x27;t heavily touch on the new ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌, but Cook notes how the device has become an integral part of his workout routine thanks to its integration with Fitness+.



The ‌iPhone 13‌ and iPhone 13 Pro are incremental upgrades compared to the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro, featuring a smaller notch, improved performance thanks to the A15 Bionic, new camera features, and more. Catch up on everything Apple announced yesterday using our event recap.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/15/ipad-air-only-ipad-lacks-12mp-front-camera/">

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Yesterday during Apple&#x27;s virtual &quot;California streaming&quot; event, Apple debuted a refreshed ninth-generation entry-level iPad ($329) and a redesigned sixth-generation iPad mini ($499). Like the iPad Pro, both devices include a 12-megapixel Ultra Wide front camera enabling Center Stage, which makes the iPad Air ($579) the only tablet in Apple&#x27;s lineup that lacks this feature.





Center Stage is a feature that automatically keeps users perfectly framed during video calls, and it does this by using the much larger field of view of the Ultra Wide front camera. 



As users move around, Center Stage automatically pans to keep them in the shot. When other people join in on the call, the camera detects them too, and smoothly zooms out to fit everyone into the view and make sure they are part of the conversation. 



Apple debuted the feature in April with the latest ‌iPad Pro‌. At the time, it was thought the machine learning capabilities of Apple&#x27;s M1 chip were required to power the feature, but given that the new iPad and iPad mini use A13 and A15 Bionic chips, respectively, that&#x27;s patently not the case.



The current ‌iPad Air‌, which debuted in September 2020, has an A14 Bionic processor, but only a f/2.0, 7-megapixel front-facing FaceTime HD Camera for selfies and video calls, making it incompatible with Center Stage. The ‌iPad Air‌ is in its mid-product cycle, however, so it&#x27;s likely to get the 12-megapixel Ultra Wide front camera in a refresh, perhaps early next year.

                    <span>Despite a smaller notch, the iPhone 13 lineup will not show users their battery percentage in the status bar, or at least, not by default, according to the ‌iPhone 13‌ simulator embedded within Xcode.





The entire ‌iPhone 13‌ series features a smaller notch, allowing for more area to display content. While many customers may have hoped that a smaller notch would lead Apple to show the battery percentage in the status bar, that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case, at least for now.



As noted on Twitter, the Xcode 13 simulator for the iPhone 13 Pro Max shows the status bar without a battery percentage, despite ample room to shift the signal and Wi-Fi bars to the left. While the simulator in the release candidate of Xcode 13, released after yesterday&#x27;s event, shows no battery percentag…</span>

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>The new iPhone 13 Pro models support 4K ProRes video recording, but there&#x27;s a catch if you want to capture video at the highest quality - you need an ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ or Pro Max with at least 256GB of storage space.





On Apple&#x27;s tech specs page for the new devices and in the press release announcing the new ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ models, Apple says that if you have an ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ or ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ Max with the base 128GB of storage, you&#x27;ll be limited to shooting 1080p ProRes video at 30 frames per second.



For recording ProRes video at 4K at 30 frames per second, higher 256, 512, or 1TB storage capacities are required.
iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max support ProRes video recording in the Camera app at 1080p 30 fps with the 128GB storage option and up to 4K 30 fps with 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB storage options.
Aimed at professionals, the ProRes codec offers higher color fidelity and less compression, and it is often used for commercials, feature films, and TV broadcasts. With ProRes support, ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ and Pro Max users can capture, edit, and share professional quality video right on their devices.



ProRes support will not be available when the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ models launch and will be coming in a future iOS 15 update.



Along with ProRes, the new ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ and Pro Max offer much improved Wide, Wide Angle, and Telephoto lenses with better low light performance, macro capabilities, Night Mode, Cinematic video recording for depth-of-field transitions, and Photographic Styles for enhancing images.

                    <span>Following the announcement of the iPhone 13 mini, ‌iPhone 13‌, iPhone 13 Pro, and ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ Max, Apple is allowing customers to get ready for pre-orders, which are set to take place on Friday, September 17 at 5:00 a.m. Pacific Time.





Existing and new iPhone Upgrade Program members can use the Apple Store app on the iPhone or Apple&#x27;s website to go through all of the pre-approval steps to get ready to purchase a new ‌iPhone‌, including checking upgrade eligibility, securing credit lines, and confirming other necessary information.



Those who are not members of the ‌iPhone‌ Upgrade Program can also select their preferred ‌iPhone‌, confirm their status with their carrier, add accessories, choose an AppleCare+ plan, and add a preferred payment method to prepare for the ‌iPhone‌ launch. Both payment in full and other payment options are supported.



With this setup process, all customers who go through the &quot;Get Ready&quot; steps will be able to pre-order their devices with the tap of a button on launch day.



Apple has always had the pre-approval process for ‌iPhone‌ Upgrade Program customers, but the new streamlined pre-order preparation for other customers appears to be a new addition.



The ‌iPhone 13‌ models are priced starting at $699, while the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ models are priced starting at $999. Pre-orders begin on Friday, September 17 at 5:00 a.m. Pacific Time.

                    <span>The Cramps were on the next level of radness. This band was a part of my teenage years, and they were one of the few non-hardcore bands that hardcore kids listened to in 1982. The Cramps were totally punk because they just did not give a fuck. They didn’t follow trends because they created their own […]

                    <span>Killian Bell, writing at Cult of Mac:
Apple Watch Series 7 is not the upgrade most of us expected to see
from Tuesday’s Apple event. The new model doesn’t sport the big
design refresh multiple sources said was coming. It doesn’t even
pack a new chip.
Is this the upgrade Apple wanted to deliver this year? Or is it
a last-minute substitution that Cupertino had to settle on
because the refresh it really wanted to deliver just wasn’t
ready to roll out?
Based on the evidence, we’re going to say it’s the latter.
The only way this could be funnier is if Bell included the theory that perhaps Apple changed the hardware at the last minute because the flat-edge designs leaked.
This is not how hardware works. These designs are set long in advance. In fact, from what I’ve heard, the flat-edge watch designs might be legitimate leaks, but they’re next year’s designs. That’s how far in advance Apple works on hardware — they were already in the advanced stages of designing the 2022 Apple Watches months ago. (Aesthetically, I am not sold on a flat-edge design for the watch. The round edges are iconic and organic.)
You can argue that Series 7 is a marginal upgrade over Series 6, but with an all-new screen (brighter and bigger), all-new crystal (more durable), and 33 percent faster charging, there are upgrades, and none of them could be slapped together.

                    <span>Citizen Lab:
In March 2021, we examined the phone of a Saudi activist who has
chosen to remain anonymous, and determined that they had been
hacked with NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware. During the course of the
analysis we obtained an iTunes backup of the device.
Recent re-analysis of the backup yielded several files with the
“.gif” extension in Library/SMS/Attachments that we determined
were sent to the phone immediately before it was hacked with NSO
Group’s Pegasus spyware.
Because the format of the files matched two types of crashes we
had observed on another phone when it was hacked with Pegasus, we
suspected that the “.gif” files might contain parts of what we are
calling the FORCEDENTRY exploit chain.
Citizen Lab forwarded the artifacts to Apple on Tuesday, September
7. On Monday, September 13, Apple confirmed that the files
included a zero-day exploit against iOS and MacOS. They designated
the FORCEDENTRY exploit CVE-2021-30860, and describe it as
“processing a maliciously crafted PDF may lead to arbitrary code
execution.”
The files with the “.gif” extension weren’t actually GIF files — they were carefully-crafted malformed PSD and PDF files that triggered image processing bugs. What makes attacks like this particularly dastardly is that the victim apparently doesn’t even see anything. It’s invisible.

Coming Thursday, comments will look different.
 Hey everyone, I’m Steph Driver, and I oversee all of our NHL sites.
This Thursday will be a big day for our community: we’re moving our comments to a brand new platform, developed especially for SB Nation. All of our hockey communities will be moving to the new platform, and I’m excited about the change.
Some of you may already be familiar with this new platform as it rolled out to our NFL communities last year and to many of our soccer sites over the summer. Over 30 new versions of the platform have been released since then, each bringing new features for SB Nation communities specifically, and changes to the user experience based on community member feedback. It’s a very different platfor…</span>

Sophomore slump, who?
 No. 19: Ronnie Attard
2020-21 League/Team(s): Western Michigan University (NCHC, NCAA)
2020-21 Statistics: 8 G, 14 A, 22 P in 25 GP
Age: 22
Acquired In: 2019 (drafted)
Ranking in Spring 2020 25 Under 25: n/a
How did Attard’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
Attard had little short of a stellar sophomore season with Western Michigan. He finished the season second in total points (behind forward Drew Worrad), and tied for second in goals scored (behind Ethen Frank and tied with Paul Washe, both forwards). It was a great campaign, for which he was named the NCHC’s best offensive defenseman at the close of the season. 
By a pretty comfortable margin, Attard was one of, if no…</span>

The former second-round pick and Guelph Storm standout slips a touch in the rankings, but has big upside.
 No. 20: Isaac Ratcliffe
2020-21 League/Team(s): Lehigh Valley Phantoms, AHL
2020-21 Statistics: 2 G, 6 A, 8 P in 22 G
Age: 22
Acquired In: 2017 NHL Entry Draft, 35th overall
Ranking in Spring 2020 25 Under 25: 15
How did Ratcliffe ’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
The 6-foot-6 forward did see an uptick in terms of point production (from .28 PPG in 2019-20 to .36 in 2020-21), so it’s hard to really say his stock went down more as the Flyers added some high-end prospects since the last run of rankings.

Ranking in Spring 2020 25 Under 25: n/a
How did Hogberg’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
All in all, it was a fine season for Hogberg. The real highlight was that he was finally able to make the jump over to North America and get rolling with the Phantoms when their season started in January. It took him a little while to get settled, but once he did, he was pretty solid for them. He wasn’t perfect, h…</span>

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *And just like that we are mere days away from Flyers hockey-related things taking place, namely rookie camp, which starts Thursday, with the rookie games against the Rangers following soon after. Exciting! [Flyers]
*The rookie game is always a fun time, it’s a shame none of us can go to see it. [NBC Sports Philly]
*Speaking of rookies; 25 Under 25! Well, this next one isn’t a rookie. Whatever, just go with it. [BSH]
*This one is a youth though. Of the college variety. [BSH]
*Okay now we are back to not-rookies. This bit didn’t really work did it? David Kase. [BSH]
*The Flyers revealed yesterday that the team will be fully vaccinated by season opening, which is just outstanding. [Flyers]
*Actually speaking of rookies though, as was mentioned yesterday, there are quite a lot of exciting ones to watch this season. [The Hockey News]
*And these are the MOST exciting prospects to watch on each team as we head into camp. [The Athletic]
*The Avs fans seem to suggest that this year’s Flyers will be an easier foe than the team they saw two years ago. They... might need to rethink that. [Mile High Hockey]
*And finally, Carter Hart got a new mask. And it’s pretty neat. [NBC Sports Philly]</span>

The UK is Hell’s 10th circle, according to Thatcher’s Techbase
 If you’re a Doom fan feeling nostalgic for the 1980s as represented by big hair, bad fashion, and British accents, look no further than Thatcher’s Techbase, a forthcoming Doom WAD that pits you against the Iron Lady and her hellspawn.
Available Sept. 24 on “PC, Mac, Linux and whatever the hell you want to try running it on,” Thatcher’s Techbase is brought to you by modder Dr. Doom Daddy and an all-star cast of collaborators. The mod supports cooperative and deathmatch play, offers five difficulty levels, and is “completely free.”
On September 24th, Margaret Thatcher will rise from her grave. Only you can send her back to Hell. 
3D: Doom Daddy Digital is proud to present         &#x27;          , a new      adventure for PC, Mac, Linux and whatever the hell you want to try running it on. pic.twitter.com/ssSwk45EoS
— Dr. Doom Daddy (@letshugbro) September 15, 2021



The mod’s official description doesn’t make it sound like this is a tribute to Maggie Thatcher, prime minister from 1979 to 1990. “Faced with the return of one of humanity’s greatest threats, you have no choice but to head to the 10th circle of hell,” it reads. “The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.” OK then!
Thatcher is regarded by historians as one of the 20th century’s more accomplished PMs, though she consistently faced low approval ratings in her public life. One would expect that of a politician who took free milk away from schoolchildren. Tut-tut.
Barry Topping (Paradise Killer) supplies the soundtrack, which will be dropping on Bandcamp next week. The cast of voice actors includes Laila Berzins, who was Persephone and Demeter in Hades (and is also The Baroness, the big bad of Lost In Random, which launched Friday). Rafael Batista de Lima illustrated the sprites, while Core Lo Art designed the key art, which shows Thatcher-as-Cyberdemon blasting away at Doomguy.</span>

The multiplayer-only game will still arrive this year
 Battlefield 2042 won’t make its intended release date. Developer DICE announced Wednesday that the game has been delayed until Nov. 19, nearly a month after its originally planned release date of Oct. 22.
In a statement released on Twitter, DICE general manager Oskar Gabrielson explained that the delay was largely due to the challenges of working from home during the pandemic.
“Building the next generation of Battlefield during a global pandemic has created unforeseen challenges for our development teams,” Gabrielson said in a statement also attributed to the Battlefield 2042 development team. “Given the scale and scope of the game, we had hoped our team would be back in our studios together as we m…</span>

EA Sports looks to technology three years in the making to set apart its flagship title
 As Sam Rivera explained it to me, the success of FIFA 22’s new animation technology will be seen in what wasn’t recorded during a groundbreaking motion-capture session — involving 22 players all playing a start-to-finish game of soccer — earlier this year.
“We started working on an algorithm about three years ago,” explained Rivera, FIFA 22’s lead gameplay producer at EA Vancouver. “What that algorithm is doing is learning from all the data for that motion capture shoot — how the players approach the ball, how many steps do they do to get to the ball, is it three long steps and one short step; what is the proper angle, with the proper cadence, to properly hi…</span>

Break the Loop
 Deathloop is a lot of things — shooter, looter, murder puzzle, time loop mystery, and more. Even after the tutorial level that cleverly introduces Blackreef’s weird rules, it still takes a while to wrap your mind around the time loop. And your success depends on understanding and manipulating those rules.
Polygon’s Deathloop walkthrough and guides are here to help you on every step of your journey to break the loop. We’ve got a beginner’s guide with 10 tips on getting started, along with lists and explainers for weapons, Slabs (Deathloop’s magic powers), and Trinkets.
Our walkthroughs will give you all the information you need to kill your assassination targets, the Visionaries, and claim their Slabs. These missions are called Visionary Leads. They’re in our preferred order in the table of contents up above, or you can use these links (which are also in our order): Ubiquity (Wenjie), Chaos Theory (Harriet) and the Nexus Slab, Space Invader (Charlie) and the Shift Slab, Afternoon Delight (Fia) and the Havoc Slab, What Wenjies Want (Wenjie again), Lost in Transmission (Egor) and the Aether Slab, The Ballad of Ramblin’ Frank (Frank), Devouring of the Lambs (Aleksis) and the Karnesis Slab, and Radio Silence (Julianna). We also have a spoiler-filled walkthrough for the game’s final Lead and ending.
We’ve also got guides to some of Deathloop’s harder to find treasures like how to find a Cat Fall Trinket or how to collect a purple-tier Pepper Mill early in the game.</span>

A game within a game
 There’s a second story running underneath’s Eastward’s main narrative. Developer Pixpil’s video game holds a second, also-playable video game called Earth Born. Presumably a reference to EarthBound, one of Eastward’s clear influences, Earth Born is an 8-bit role-playing game with a story that mimics Eastward’s own, a tale so beloved across Potcrock Isle, Whitewhale Bay, and New Dam City that nearly everyone you meet in Eastward plays it.
Playing it with locals in different areas is one of Eastward’s sheer delights, meeting rambunctious school kids to take turns on the sticks. Like I wrote in my review, Earth Born is surprisingly deep — a full, yet small game that just ma…</span>

                    <span>For her project Topography of Tears, Rose-Lynn Fisher used a scanning electron microscope to photograph the crystalized patterns of dried human tears. Part of why the images all look different is because tears are made up of varying chemicals depending on why they’re made.
Scientifically, tears are divided into three different types, based on their origin. Both tears of grief and joy are psychic tears, triggered by extreme emotions, whether positive or negative. Basal tears are released continuously in tiny quantities (on average, 0.75 to 1.1 grams over a 24-hour period) to keep the cornea lubricated. Reflex tears are secreted in response to an irritant, like dust, onion vapors or tear gas.
All tears contain a variety of biological substances (including oils, antibodies and enzymes) suspended in salt water, but as Fisher saw, tears from each of the different categories include distinct molecules as well. Emotional tears, for instance, have been found to contain protein-based hormones including the neurotransmitter leucine enkephalin, a natural painkiller that is released when the body is under stress.

                    <span>In this wonderful short documentary by Lydia Cornett, we meet Yves Deshommes and observe him moving through his many responsibilities and interests in life, including being an NYC concierge, art dealing, raising his daughter, playing the violin, and helping his home country of Haiti.
Deshommes, who grew up in Haiti, came to New York on a student visa in 1985. He was seventeen years old, and when his visa expired he became undocumented. He lived with an older brother and took classes day and night and through the summer in order to finish high school in two years. “I became a man the moment I set foot on U.S. soil, full of responsibility,” he told me. He started playing the violin a few years later, with teachers at the Harlem School of the Arts. He was soon practicing several hours a day and working long shifts at Pizza Hut. He felt that he was too old to train as a professional, but his practice had become central to his life: “Music was the escape, music was the goal. Music was what made me achieve great things,” he said. “The violin gives me a discipline where I feel I can conquer anything.”

                    <span>Apple today held its annual iPhone-centric event, introducing the iPhone 13 mini, ‌iPhone 13‌, ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro, and ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro Max. We also got a look at the new Apple Watch Series 7 and were surprised with the new ninth-generation low-cost iPad and the iPad mini 6.

It took Apple an hour and twenty minutes to introduce the new devices during the &quot;California Streaming&quot; event, but we&#x27;ve recapped all of the announcements in a seven-minute video for our readers who want a no-frills but thorough overview of everything that&#x27;s new.

                    <span>With the launch of the iPhone 13 mini, ‌iPhone 13‌, ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro, and ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro Max, Apple introduced several updated camera features, some of which are hardware based and some of which are software based.





Notably, the ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro and ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro Max now have identical camera systems, a departure from the different cameras featured in the iPhone 12 Pro and the 12 Pro Max. As usual, the ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro models have the best camera systems, while the more affordable ‌iPhone 13‌ models have step-down cameras that lack some of the Pro capabilities.



iPhone 13 and 13 mini Camera Specs

                    <span>Apple hasn&#x27;t released full details on the Apple Watch Series 7 as of yet because it&#x27;s not set to launch until later this fall, but the new Apple Watch bands that came out today confirm that the Series 7 will be available in 41mm and 45mm sizes.





The 41mm ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ replaces the 40mm Apple Watch Series 6, while the 45mm ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ replaces the 44mm ‌Apple Watch Series 6‌.



41 and 45mm size updates were rumored, as was the significant redesign for the display, but the design of the Apple Watch itself came as a surprise. Multiple rumors from Jon Prosser, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Bloomberg, and other sources suggested the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ would see a flat-edged design similar to the iPhone 12 models, but that did not happen.

                    <span>Apple today indicated that &quot;back-glass only&quot; damage on iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 models is now eligible for repair under AppleCare+ for a reduced fee of $29 in the United States, $39 in Canada, £25 in the UK, or the equivalent in other countries.





Prior to this change, cracked or damaged back glass on an iPhone 12 cost $99 to be repaired if the device was covered by an AppleCare+ plan.



In order to qualify for the $29 repair, the iPhone must be covered by AppleCare+ and have no additional damage beyond the damaged back glass that would prevent Apple from replacing the back glass, such as a bent or dented enclosure.



Back glass repairs at the reduced rate are not available on models older than the iPhone 12, according to Apple. More details are available on the iPhone Repair and Service website and in the newly updated AppleCare+ terms and conditions.

                    <span>According to the technical specifications for the iPhone 13, ‌iPhone 13‌ mini, ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro, and ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro Max, all of the devices include dual eSIM support, which is a feature that&#x27;s new to the iPhone lineup this year.





Dual eSIM support means that the ‌iPhone 13‌ models can use two eSIMs simultaneously rather than just one eSIM and one nano-SIM.



Prior ‌iPhone‌ models like the iPhone 12 had dual-SIM support, but only worked with an eSIM and a physical nano-SIM. The ‌iPhone 13‌ models still support eSIM and nano-SIM, but also support two eSIMs for adopting carrier plans without a physical SIM card.



Apple&#x27;s ‌iPhone 13‌ models will not ship with a physical SIM card this year and carriers will instead use eSIM capabilities for activation. Because eSIM activation is being used for devices connected to a carrier when ordering, a WiFi connection will be needed for setup. From Apple:

Carrier-connected iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro models will arrive ready to activate with eSIM and can connect to your cellular voice and data service without a physical SIM card. You will need a Wi-Fi connection for setup.



To activate eSIM on an unconnected iPhone, please contact the carrier of your choice when you&#x27;re ready.


Connecting with a carrier later can be done by inserting a physical SIM or contacting a carrier for eSIM activation.



The ‌iPhone 13‌ models will be available for pre-order on Friday, September 17, and will officially launch on Friday, September 24.

                    <span>Apple&#x27;s iPhone 13 models are nearly identical in design to the iPhone 12 models, but there are some slight differences in weight and thickness.





All of the ‌iPhone 13‌ models are heavier than their ‌iPhone 12‌ counterparts, likely due to the larger batteries that are inside and the thickness increase. Weight comparisons are below.



 	
‌iPhone 13‌ mini - 141 grams vs. 135 grams


 	
‌iPhone 13‌ - 174 grams vs. 164 grams


 	
‌iPhone 13‌ Pro - 204 grams vs. 189 grams


 	
‌iPhone 13‌ Pro Max - 240 grams vs. 228 grams




The ‌iPhone 13‌ models are a bit thicker than the iPhone 12 Pro models, which is in line with what we were expecting from rumors. All of the ‌iPhone 13‌ models are 7.65mm thick, up from 7.4mm for the ‌iPhone 12‌ lineup.



Height and width of the new models are the same compared to the ‌iPhone 12‌, but the change in thickness and the new design for the cameras for some models will mean the iPhone 12 cases likely won&#x27;t fit ‌iPhone 13‌ models.

                    <span>Following the launch of the iPhone 13 Pro and ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro Max earlier today, which features ProMotion displays with a variable 120Hz refresh rate, Samsung has come out in an apparent jab to Apple for being late to join the wider industry in adopting higher refresh displays.





In a tweet as the Apple event was underway earlier today, the official Samsung Mobile account tweeted &quot;We’ve been refreshing at 120Hz for a while now...&quot; While Apple has been widely rumored to adopt ProMotion in its iPhone over the past few years, Samsung has only just recently adopted a 120Hz refresh rate. 




We’ve been refreshing at 120Hz for a while now...
— Samsung Mobile US (@SamsungMobileUS) September 14, 2021
 


The first flagship Samsung smartphone to adopt a 120Hz refresh rate was the Galaxy S20, released in March of 2020, meaning Samsung may be slightly exaggerating the timeline in its tweet.



The ‌‌iPhone 13‌‌ Pro and ‌‌iPhone 13‌‌ Pro Max, alongside the ‌‌iPhone 13‌‌ and ‌‌iPhone 13‌‌ mini, feature smaller notches, faster performance, and improved cameras. Catch up on all the announcements from Apple&#x27;s event today right here on our website.

                    <span>Apple&#x27;s new iPhone 13 models that were released today feature an updated TrueDepth camera and a new design for the notch, which has been slimmed down.





Apple said on stage that the notch is now 20 percent less wide than the notch used in prior models, but comparisons between the iPhone 12 and ‌iPhone 13‌ confirm that the new notch design is just a tad bit taller.



In the overlay above, you can see the size difference in action. The notch is indeed a good bit smaller, and the tiny increase in height is barely noticeable.



The new notch design is in line with rumors that we heard during the beta testing period, which pointed to a design that was more compact and just a tiny bit taller.



Next year, Apple may do away with the notch entirely. Rumors suggest that at least some models will have no notch with a design that instead incorporates a hole-punch cutout for the front-facing camera, with Apple to adopt under-display Face ID.

                    <span>Apple today began selling certified refurbished models of the Apple TV 4K and Apple TV HD with the redesigned Siri Remote for the first time in the United States, Canada, and many European countries, with prices discounted by around 15% as usual.





In the United States, for example, a refurbished Apple TV 4K with 32GB of storage and the redesigned Siri Remote is priced at $149, compared to $179 brand new. Or, customers can bump up to a refurbished 64GB Apple TV 4K for $169, compared to $199 brand new. Apple is also offering refurbished Apple TV HD models with the redesigned Siri Remote.



Apple says all of its refurbished products are thoroughly cleaned, inspected, and guaranteed to be fully functional, and in many cases, Apple&#x27;s refurbished products are virtually indistinguishable from brand new products.



The new Apple TV 4K with the redesigned Siri Remote debuted in April, with other key features including Wi-Fi 6 and HDMI 2.1.

                    <span>Coinciding with the new Apple Watch Series 7 debut, Apple has unveiled some new watch faces that will be exclusive to the new model.





Amongst the new faces are Modular Max, World Time, Contour Face, and Nike Bounce, the latter of which is exclusive to the Series 7 Nike edition.





The Modular Max displays the digital time alongside a single complication, and includes longer complications that display across the screen below, which can show information like the day of the week, outside temperature, heart rate, activity, or quick access to an app.





The Continuum watch face shows the flow of time around the edges and the current hour, while the World Time lets users see all 24 time zones simultaneously, thanks to an external dial that shows the time zones and an inner dial that shows the time in each location.





The new Nike Bounce watch face dynamically animates with a tap of the screen, a scroll of the Digital Crown, or a move of the wrist. Apple says it pairs well with the refreshed Nike Sport Loop, which features the Nike Swoosh and logo text incorporated into the weave of the band. Meanwhile, the Hermes version has numbers that change hour by hour.





‌Apple says that the price of the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌‌ starts at $399 and the new model will be available later this fall. For more on the Series 7 model, check out Apple&#x27;s original announcement.

                    <span>At today&#x27;s &quot;California Streaming&quot; event, Apple announced a new USB-C Apple Watch charging puck designed specifically with the Series 7 models in mind.





Priced at $29, the Apple Watch Magnetic Fast Charger to USB-C cable can charge an Apple Watch Series 7 33 percent faster than the standard Apple Watch charging puck, reaching an 80 percent charge in 45 minutes.
We wanted to make charging your Apple Watch utterly effortless. And now, it charges up to 33% faster when paired with Apple Watch Series 7, so you can reach 80% charge in about 45 minutes. Simply hold the connector near the back of the watch, where magnets cause it to snap into place automatically. It&#x27;s a completely sealed system free of exposed contacts. And it&#x27;s very forgiving, requiring no precise alignment.
To enable the faster charging speeds, the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ has an updated charging architecture inside. The fast charging technology is limited to the Series 7 for this reason.





The new Apple Watch charging puck can be purchased from Apple&#x27;s website starting today, but the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ models won&#x27;t be launching until later this fall. When available, the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ will likely ship with the new fast charging cable as it has the same price point as the standard cable.

                    <span>Apple today released a new version of the MagSafe Wallet, now featuring support for the Find My network and five new color options.





The new ‌MagSafe‌ Wallet can now give the location where it was last separated from your iPhone in the ‌Find My‌ app:



Designed with both style and function in mind, the new iPhone Leather Wallet with MagSafe is the perfect way to keep your ID and credit cards close at hand. It now supports Find My, so you can be notified of your wallet&#x27;s last known location if it gets separated from your phone.




Other than new color options, the ‌MagSafe‌ Wallet continues to be made from tanned European leather with the same shielded design that can contain up to three cards. 



The new ‌MagSafe‌ Wallet is compatible with the iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max, as well as the iPhone 13 mini, ‌iPhone 13‌, ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro, and ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro Max. For reasons that are not yet known, the ‌MagSafe‌ Wallet&#x27;s ‌Find My‌ functionality does not work when the wallet is used with Apple&#x27;s Clear Case.



The new ‌MagSafe‌ Wallet is available now for $59 in Golden Brown, Dark Cherry, Sequoia Green, Midnight, and Wisteria.

                    <span>At today&#x27;s &quot;California Streaming&quot; event, Apple introduced refreshed versions of the iPad mini and the low-cost iPad, which was something of a surprise as we were expecting new tablet announcements later in the year. Both the iPad mini 6 and the ‌iPad‌ 9 are available for pre-order starting today, with orders up and live following the conclusion of the event.





The ‌iPad‌ 9, which replaces the eighth-generation version, continues to be priced at $329. It features an A13 chip, up to 256GB of storage, and a new 12-megapixel Ultra Wide front-facing camera that supports Center Stage for video calls. 



Compared to prior versions, it includes sRGB support and a True Tone display, with no improvements to the rear camera. It continues to feature thick bezels and a Touch ID Home button. 



The ‌iPad mini 6‌, priced starting at $499, features a much more significant redesign. The new ‌iPad mini‌ is basically a smaller version of the iPad Air with an 8.3-inch all-display design, slim bezels, and a ‌Touch ID‌ power button. 



It too features a 12-megapixel Ultra Wide front-facing camera with Center Stage, and it can be purchased with up to 256GB of storage. It&#x27;s equipped with Apple&#x27;s latest and fastest A15 chip, which is also the chip used in the new iPhone 13 models. 



The ‌iPad mini‌ comes in unique new colors that include pink, purple, space gray, and starlight, while the ‌iPad‌ 9 is available in space gray and silver. 



Both the ‌iPad mini 6‌ and the ‌iPad‌ 9 models will be delivered to customers starting on September 24, which is also the launch date for the new iPhone models.

                    <span>Thanks to the larger display on the Apple Watch Series 7, users can now use a full keyboard right on their wrist. Users will be able to tap or slide across letters to type, in which case watchOS will use &quot;machine learning to predict the word you’re typing.&quot; 





The new ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌, which comes in larger 41mm and 45mm sizes, features larger displays compared to the Series 6 thanks to smaller bezels. 



Alongside a full keyboard, Apple says it has redesigned the buttons and menus across watchOS to make it easier to tap on the larger displays. Due to reported production issues, the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ will be available later this fall, with no specific date currently given.

                    <span>Sascha Segan, writing for PCMag:
Well, that was bogus.
Both prominent analyst Ming-chi Kuo and extremely reliable Apple
reporter Mark Gurman got seemingly taken in this year by a rumor
that the new iPhone 13 line would talk to satellites,
something that completely didn’t happen during the company’s
iPhone 13 announcement on Tuesday.
In fact, the iPhone 13 doesn’t even feature 5G band n53, the
ground-based 5G band owned by satellite operator Globalstar, which
I had speculated was the grain of truth in the rumors. So I was
wrong, too. […]
We may never know what really caused those rumors to spark,
but I wonder darkly if it has to do with some sort of stock
pump-and-dump situation. Satellite provider Globalstar’s
stock jumped after Kuo’s report, and now it’s crashing
back to earth.
It’s possible that the iPhones 13 do contain a satellite-connectivity-compatible chip, but Apple made no mention of it as a feature. Gurman was circumspect about whether the feature would actually ship, but Kuo seemingly reported it as fact.

                    <span>Jordan Moreau, reporting for Variety:
Norm Macdonald, the deadpan comedian, actor, writer and “Saturday
Night Live” star, has died after a private battle with cancer,
Variety has confirmed. He was 61.
Macdonald’s cancer diagnosis was kept secret from the public, but
he battled it for nine years.
Terrible news. Fuck cancer, man.
It’s hard to pick one favorite Macdonald bit, but his portrayal of Turd Ferguson on Celebrity Jeopardy makes me laugh every damn time I watch it.

                    <span>May 19:
The upcoming Apple Watch Series 7 will feature a flat-edged
design, similar to the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro, and the
addition of a new green case color option, according to Apple
leaker Jon Prosser.
Bonus points to Prosser for commissioning 3D renders of a fictional design.
Mark Gurman, two weeks ago:
While last year’s upgrade centered on the blood-oxygen sensor,
this year’s is all about a new design with a flatter display and
edges, a faster processor and slightly larger screens.
Today: A big nope on those flat edges. No always-on display mode for any of the new iPhones, either.

Basically, there’s a podcast for that. You can learn any topic by listening to podcasts. And it seems that every domain expert has already done some podcast interviews.
Podcasts have become my primary informal learning resource. And I built a podcast search engine (listennotes.com) to help myself listen to ~5,000 podcast episodes in the past 4 years! In this blog post, I’ll share with you my quirky way of podcast discovery and consumption :)

How did Kase’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is their stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
Kase played the majority of his 2020-21 season in the Czech Extraliga, where he scored at nearly a point-per-game pace on a team that finished 10th out of 14th place in the league. His 25 points was 6th best on his team.

How did O’Brien’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
It’s been a bit of a strange road for O’Brien, but after a rough freshman season with Providence College and then a season in Pentiction of the BCHL before transferring to Boston University, he’s finally looking to be getting himself back on track.

How did Rubtsov’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
The short answer here is that last season was a little underwhelming, to say the least. Rubtsov spent the whole of last season on loan to Sochi of the KHL, and he just never really seemed to get his offensive game rolling. There were some flashes where it looked like things were coming together for him, but we didn’t see it on a consistent basis.

 *FOLKS! We have kicked off the 25 Under 25 festivities. It’s always fun to see where guys end up, don’t you think? [BSH]
*As typically happens the bottom of the ranking ended up producing a few ties, so first up, tied for 24 (or 25, however you fancy), is a Russian goalie whose recent success has showed a bit of promise, development-wise. [BSH]
*Speaking of development, Travis Konency is a father now, which means this season we should see New &amp; Improved Konecny: Dad Strength Edition. [Inquirer]
*Meltzer, on why rookie camp is important, despite the relative lack of influence it may have on the opening day roster. [Hockeybuzz]
*Speaking of rookies, will any of the Flyers’ potential rookie players win the Calder this season? Almost certainly not. But hoo boy are there some fun kids to watch this season. [ProHockeyTalk]
*And finally, in what is truly the most exciting development of the summer, the Flyers are looking for a new goal song. And they want to hear from us, the fans. So let them know, pals! We never have to hear Feel The Shake again!!! [BSH]</span>

Ubisoft San Francisco has no word on a new launch window
 Rocksmith Plus won’t make the summer 2021 launch window developers originally hoped for, the studio announced on Tuesday. It’ll be using the extra time to work on several core features, using feedback from from a closed beta that took place in June and July.
Lead producer Arthur von Nagel didn’t characterize the news as a delay, however, saying Ubisoft San Francisco “didn’t set a hard date because we wanted the flexibility to react to feedback and to adjust release timelines to match.”
Von Nagel did not say when the game would now launch. The studio will be working on feedback in four areas — song library; audio inputs and note detection; progression and education; UI, search, and content discoverability.
With regard to the song library, “we’re committed to offering over 5,000 songs” at launch, Von Nagel wrote. The closed beta purposefully had a selection of about 500 songs. He went into greater detail about the other three development areas in a message to the community.
“We understand that this delay is disappointing,” Von Nagel wrote. “Every Rocksmith Plus player deserves to easily find the music you care about, to feel a sense of growth and mastery over your instrument, and to trust that the notes you play are heard fairly and accurately.”
Rocksmith Plus was announced in June during E3 2021. The guitar-teaching sim is scheduled to launch on Windows PC first, followed by launches on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. Following that, Rocksmith Plus will come to Android and iOS devices, too.
Rocksmith Plus will be a subscription-based service, with Ubisoft offering $14.99, $39.99, and $99.99 plans for monthly, three months, and annual subscriptions.</span>

Every trophy and achievement and how to earn all 55
 There are 55 trophies and achievements to earn in Deathloop. Below, you’ll find a list of all 55 and their descriptions broken down into five broad categories. We’ve linked to our other guides to help you get some of the tougher ones.
Deathloop Visionary trophies
There are 17 trophies and achievements that relate to Deathloop’s eight Visionaries — mostly different ways to kill them.
Pieces of Eight. While playing as Colt, kill Frank. Or Charlie. Or Fia. Or Wenjie. Or Aleksis. Or Harriet. Egor will do as well.
Ensemble Tragedy. Kill each Visionary at least once.
Alpha Burger. Kill Aleksis using his meat grinder.
Power Chord. Kill Frank using a Slab ability. Take a bow.

It’s strange and wondrous, and above all, it treats me with respect
 Of the many fantasies humanity has entertained, conquering time has been paramount, whether through time machines, freezing, or reversing. If time is the great consumer, then those that control time control the universe. It is no wonder, then, that the villains of Deathloop have decided to seize time for themselves. 
Arkane Lyon’s latest sandbox adventure deploys a time mechanic like no other game. The studio has created the equivalent of a finely tuned watch. And it’s truly one of the most incredible video game experiences of my life.

The Xbox App can stream from the cloud or your home console
 The Xbox App for Windows 10 PCs will now let players stream console games on their computer, thanks to an update that went live on Tuesday.
The game streaming that the update enables will let Xbox Game Pass subscribers play games that their PCs otherwise might not have the specs to handle. According to Microsoft, playing games directly from an Xbox console with Remote Play will provide the smoothest experience, while using the cloud will be slightly more taxing, but won’t require a download. 
Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers are currently able to stream games in browsers from their phones, tablets, and PCs, but the new option will allow streaming directly into the Windows 10 Xbox App. One thing that isn’t available yet is streaming games directly to Xbox Series X consoles, but Microsoft says that feature’s on the way later this year. 


The cloud option is limited to titles on Xbox Game Pass. Other games that players own may be streamed using Remote Play, because the game is running on the console. 
To stream games to the Xbox App from the cloud, players just need a compatible controller and an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription. Otherwise the Remote Play option is available through the Xbox App on Windows 10 PCs.</span>

Microsoft confirms September’s remaining Xbox and PC games 
 Xbox Game Pass subscribers will get a fresh batch of diverse Xbox and PC games through the end of September, including promising indie games SkateBird (in which you play as a skateboarding bird), Sable (the stylish 3D adventure featuring music from Japanese Breakfast), and Flynn: Son of Crimson (a colorful 2D platformer-adventure). 
Flynn: Son of Crimson, I Am Fish, SkateBird, Superliminal, and Aragami 2 all come to Xbox Game Pass on Xbox consoles, Windows PC, and cloud-supported devices by Sept. 17, while Sable comes to all three on Sept. 23. Here’s everything Xbox Game Pass subscribers can expect through Oct. 1:
Flynn: Son of Crimson (Cloud, Console, and PC) – Sept. 15
I Am Fish (Cloud, Console, and PC) – Sept. 16
SkateBird (Cloud, Console, and PC) – Sept. 16
Superliminal (Cloud, Console, and PC) – Sept. 16
Aragami 2 (Cloud, Console, and PC) – Sept. 17
Lost Words: Beyond the Page (Cloud, Console, and PC) – Sept. 23
Sable (Cloud, Console, and PC) – Sept. 23
Subnautica: Below Zero (Cloud, Console, and PC) – Sept. 23

Those titles join recently added Xbox Game Pass games Final Fantasy 13, Nuclear Throne, The Artful Escape, and Surgeon Simulator 2.
All good things must come to an end, so here’s what’s leaving Xbox Game Pass in September.

Moist, even
 There have been a lot of questions about Cyberpunk 2077 since it launched in December, but none more strange that the one asked by the Polygon video team: Is Cyberpunk 2077 wet enough? We can now safely say that no, in fact, the game clearly launched without the requisite amount of moisture. The latest patch, numbered 1.31, should fix that.
As far as Cyberpunk patches go, this is a pretty small one. There were a few quest bugs that got squashed, but nothing game-breaking it sounds like. The PlayStation got a little “GPU optimization,” so we’ll have to see how that shakes out performance wise. But this update didn’t even come with a mock newscast to herald its arrival. From the description, it sounds like you might not even notice it. “Please note that the issues listed below did not affect all players” CD Projekt said in its preamble. 
But then there’s this note:
Fixed an issue where roads after rain did not look wet, which was the result of ongoing work on the Wet Surfaces System. In 1.31 wet surfaces should look more detailed than they did even before the issue occurred.



As Polygon’s official wet correspondent pointed out in February, Night City should be damp,  its surfaces sodden, and even its smoothest features covered in rivulets of water because that’s how it was described by Mike Pondsmith and the team at R. Talsorian Games when the original tabletop game launched in the 1980s.
“It always rains,” reads the official worldbook. “Every day should be grim, gloomy and overcast. The stars never come out. The sun never shines. There are no singing birds, laughing children. The last bird died in 2008 and the kids are grown in vats. The ozone layer is decayed, the greenhouse effect took over, the sky is full of hydrocarbons and the ocean full of sludge. Nice place.”
So, if anything, CD Projekt’s vision of the gritty urban metropolis is too gritty, and not nearly grimy enough. Today’s patch should fix that. You can find the full patch notes on the official website.</span>

If you’re just joining us — welcome but WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN THO?! — I do a post like this every few months with short reviews of all the movies, books, music, TV show, podcasts, and other things I’ve enjoyed (or not) recently. The letter grades are very subjective and inconsistent — sorry! Ok, here’s what I have for you today.
The Land That Never Has Been Yet. This podcast series by Scene on Radio on American democracy is essential listening. The episode on how a small group of libertarians have had an outsized influence on American life is especially interesting and maddening. (A)
The Legend of Korra. Watched this with the kids and we all enjoyed it. (B+)

                    <span>The Wire creator David Simon wrote about his friend and colleague Michael K. Williams, who died suddenly last week at the age of 54. The Question Michael K. Williams Asked Me Before Every Season of ‘The Wire’:
And from that moment forward, his questions about our drama and its purposes were those of someone sharing the whole of the journey. It became something of a ritual with us: To begin every season that followed, Michael K. Williams would walk into the writers’ office and sit on the couch.
“So,” he would ask, “what are we going to say this year?”
He gave us an astounding gift — an act of faith from a magnificent actor who could have played his hand very differently. Television usually chases its audience — if they love them some Omar, you feed them more Omar. If they can’t stop looking at Stringer, you write more Stringer. Never mind story and theme.
Instead, Mike bent his beautiful mind to a task that even the best writers and show runners often avoid. He thought about the whole story, the whole of the work.
Perhaps more than any in that talented cast, I came to trust Mike to speak publicly to our drama and its purposes, to take personal pride in all that we were trying, however improbably, to build. He became increasingly political as the show aged, and in interviews took to addressing societal and political issues, his arguments ranging well beyond Omar’s arc.
“I started to realize that, oh, this is not about me,” Williams once told an interviewer, looking back. “It had everything to do with … just great tapestry, this great narrative of social issues … things that are wrong in our country.”

                    <span>Epic Games today paid Apple $6,000,000 in royalties, ‌Epic Games‌ CEO Tim Sweeney said on Twitter. As part of the ruling in the ongoing Epic v. Apple legal battle, Epic was last week ordered by the court to pay 30 percent of the revenue that it collected from the Fortnite app using its illicit direct payment option.





Back at the start of the dispute between Epic and Apple, Epic added a direct purchase option to the Fortnite app, skirting Apple&#x27;s in-app purchase rules. This violation of Apple&#x27;s App Store guidelines led Apple to pull Fortnite from the App Store, and directly after that, Epic filed its pre-planned lawsuit.

                    <span>Apple will be hosting a virtual event tomorrow that is expected to revolve around the iPhone 13, Apple Watch Series 7, and third-generation AirPods. With new Mac and iPad models also rumored to be on the horizon, Apple reportedly plans to hold at least one additional event before the end of the year, and the company&#x27;s annual Back to School promotion could provide a clue as to when the next event might take place.





Specifically, on September 15 of last year, Apple extended its Back to School promotion to run through Monday, October 12 in the U.S. At the time, the extension seemed insignificant, but Apple later announced that it would be holding an event on Tuesday, October 13, which happened to be just one day after the promotion ended.

                    <span>T-Mobile today announced that its T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile smartphones will soon be available in more than 2,300 Walmart locations across the United States, significantly expanding T-Mobile&#x27;s footprint.





T-Mobile devices will be listed on Walmart.com, though customers will need to visit a Walmart store to make a purchase. The rollout follows the availability of T-Mobile devices in Best Buy retail stores and the Best Buy website earlier this year.



Prior to becoming available in Walmart and Best Buy, T-Mobile iPhones were only available from Apple or direct from T-Mobile&#x27;s website and stores, which prevented customers from taking advantage of deals offered by brick and mortar retailers.
&quot;In many parts of the country, limited competition when it comes to wireless service leaves some people with few options for plans or access to the benefits of 5G,&quot; said Jon Freier, Executive Vice President, T-Mobile Consumer Group. &quot;5G for All means T-Mobile is bringing real choice and competition in wireless to many Americans. And even though online shopping continues to grow, we know that retail stores remain one of the primary places where wireless customers pick up devices and service. We&#x27;re working to expand our retail footprint across the country to meet more people in more places every day.&quot;
Metro by T-Mobile smartphone displays will be available in Walmart retail locations on Monday, October 18. Standard T-Mobile smartphones and plans will be available in Walmart stores starting on Monday, November 1.

                    <span>Today&#x27;s iOS 14.8 update addresses a critical vulnerability that Apple engineers have been working around the clock to fix, reports The New York Times.





Last week, The Citizen Lab informed Apple about a new zero-click iMessage exploit targeting Apple&#x27;s image rendering library. Called FORCEDENTRY, the exploit could infect an iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, or Mac with the Pegasus spyware, providing access to the camera and microphone in addition to allowing access to text messages, phone calls, and emails.



FORCEDENTRY was distributed by Israel&#x27;s NSO Group to governments and various other entities, and The Citizen Lab discovered it after analyzing the ‌iPhone‌ of a Saudi activist. Details were sent to Apple on September 7, and Apple took a week to fix the bug. According to The Cit…</span>

                    <span>The Acura MDX is Honda&#x27;s luxury-brand three-row SUV, and with the recent launch of the 2022 model, the MDX now supports wireless CarPlay. The MDX is Acura&#x27;s first vehicle with wireless ‌CarPlay‌, and I recently had a chance to check out the updated model and some of its new features.





The MDX starts at $47,200, but my test vehicle was equipped Acura&#x27;s Super Handling All-Wheel Drive, Technology Package, and sporty A-Spec Package, which pushed the sticker price over $57,000. A high-end Advance Package with a few additional features would see the MDX top out at just over $60,000.

The Acura infotainment system remains fairly similar to the system I tested in the 2019 version of the RDX, Acura&#x27;s smaller two-row SUV, although the MDX comes with …</span>

                    <span>The AI-powered fitness gym &quot;Tempo&quot; today announced integration with the Apple Watch, allowing Tempo customers to sync their workouts and fitness and health data directly to their Apple Watch.





Amongst its demographic of users, Tempo says that more than 70% are iPhone users, with a smaller 35% owning an Apple Watch. Tempo had been teasing Apple Watch integration for some time, and with it finally arriving, Tempo customers now have access to a host of settings, features, and data right on their wrist. During workouts, for example, customers can pause and resume sessions without needing to touch the Tempo display, minimizing distractions and wasted time. 



More importantly, Apple Watch integration means that Tempo customers will no longer need to rely on third-party or external health monitoring equipment during their workouts. Using the built-in sensors on the Apple Watch, Tempo customers can now access their heart rate, calorie burn, and additional data synced with their Tempo workouts.



For those unfamiliar with Tempo, the company calls itself &quot;the only home gym with interactive coaching&quot; that uses 3D sensors with advanced AI technology to help customers perfect their form and workouts during training. Tempo offers not only real-time feedback but also coaching and &quot;premium&quot; dumbells worth upwards of $1,000.

                    <span>Apple today released macOS Big Sur 11.6, the sixth major update to the ‌macOS Big Sur‌ operating system that first launched in November 2020. ‌macOS Big Sur‌ 11.6 comes a month after the release of macOS Big Sur 11.5.2, a bug fix update.





The new ‌‌‌‌‌‌‌macOS Big Sur‌‌‌‌‌‌ 11.6 update can be downloaded all eligible Macs using the Software Update section of System Preferences.



According to Apple&#x27;s release notes, ‌macOS Big Sur‌ improves the security of macOS and is recommended for all users. Apple has also released security update 2021-005 for macOS Catalina, and both updates address an issue that could allow a maliciously crafted PDF to execute code. Apple says that it is aware of a report that this bug may have been actively exploited.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Apple today released iOS 14.8, marking the eighth major update to the iOS operating system that came out in September 2020. iOS 14.8 comes two months after the release of iOS 14.7, an update that introduced MagSafe Battery Pack support.





The iOS 14.8 update can be downloaded for free and the software is available on all eligible devices over-the-air in the Settings app. To access the new software, go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update. Apple has also released a new version if iPadOS 14. 



According to Apple&#x27;s release notes, iOS 14.8 is a security-focused update that is recommended for all users. Apple&#x27;s security support document outlines two major fixes that have been implemented for issues that Apple says may have been actively exploited. 



There is a CoreGraphics bug that could allow a maliciously crafted PDF to lead to arbitrary code execution, as well as a WebKit vulnerability that could allow maliciously crafted web content to execute code.



iOS 14.8 could one of the final updates to the iOS 14 operating system as we&#x27;re expecting the iOS 15 update to be released in just a couple of weeks, but Apple has said that it plans to allow people to keep using iOS 14 if they don&#x27;t want to upgrade to ‌iOS 15‌. For that reason, ‌iOS 14‌ may continue to get small security updates over time, but new features will likely be limited to ‌iOS 15‌.



Update 10:16 a.m.: Apple has also released watchOS 7.6.2 with similar security fixes for Apple Watch Series 3 and later.

                    <span>Apple TV+ is Apple&#x27;s streaming service, written, produced, and developed by Apple and its partners, so it shouldn&#x27;t come as a surprise for anyone to learn that Apple products are commonly placed throughout scenes for ‌Apple TV+‌ shows, but they&#x27;re all done for specific reasons.





A new video report by The Wall Street Journal, which required watching over 74 episodes of ‌Apple TV+‌ shows, including Ted Lasso, The Morning Show, Defending Jacob, and Trying, outlines precisely how and why Apple product placements are done throughout specific episodes.



According to the report, throughout 74 ‌Apple TV+‌ episodes, 300 iPhones, 120 MacBooks, and 40 pairs of AirPods were shown throughout certain scenes. That equates to over 700 Apple product placements. To put that into perspective,…</span>

                    <span>With the launch of iOS 14.2, Apple introduced a new Shazam Music Recognition toggle for the Control Center, giving iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch users a quick and easy way to identify what music is playing.





Music Recognition has been a popular Control Center integration, and according to Apple, Shazam just surpassed 1 billion cumulative recognitions from the Control Center on iOS devices.



Compared to the standard Shazam app, Music Recognition is unique because it allows users to identify songs playing in their favorite apps, TV shows, and movies even while wearing headphones, a feature available in addition to the option to identify songs playing out loud.



The number one most Shazamed track from the Control Center is Bruno Mars&#x27; &quot;Talking to the Moon,&quot; with a list of…</span>

                    <span>Apple Maps team members wearing specialized camera-equipped backpacks will be walking in Canada&#x27;s three largest cities of Toronto, Montréal, and Vancouver through October to help improve the Apple Maps app.

Apple typically drives a fleet of vehicles around the world to collect Maps data, including street-level imagery for its Look Around feature, but it conducts pedestrian surveys &quot;in areas where vehicles simply can&#x27;t go.&quot; Apple promises that the pedestrian surveys offer the &quot;same privacy protections as the Apple Maps vehicles.&quot;



A list of locations maintained on Apple&#x27;s website reveals that the company began the pedestrian surveys in Toronto, Montréal, and Vancouver on September 11. Apple will also be surveying the Region of Durham immediately east of Toronto.



Apple says it is committed to protecting the public&#x27;s privacy while conducting these surveys. In line with Google&#x27;s Street View, Apple censors faces and license plates in imagery made available through its Look Around feature. If you have comments or questions about this process, your privacy rights, or would like to request that a face, license plate, or your own house be censored, Apple says to email mapsimagecollection@apple.com.



Introduced in iOS 13, Look Around provides 3D street-level imagery that can be zoomed and panned. The feature is already available in Canada, but Apple periodically revisits some locations &quot;in an effort to maintain a high-quality, up-to-date map.&quot; Look Around is also available in parts of the United States, UK, Ireland, and Japan.

                    <span>As is frequently the case, Apple’s 2021 product launch schedule seems to be weighted toward the latter part of the year, with a number of new products still expected to debut. While Apple is planning to hold an event this week, it won&#x27;t include everything Apple&#x27;s expected to announce before the year ends. 





On Tuesday, September 14, Apple will be holding its &quot;California streaming&quot; event, which is expected to include the release of the brand new iPhone 13, Apple Watch Series 7, and possibly the third-generation AirPods. 



Given we&#x27;re expecting several new products before the end of the year, it&#x27;s important to note that this single event, out of what is likely to be at least two events of this fall, will not include the launch of everything we&#x27;re expecting. Here&#x27;s a quick run…</span>

This is still the lowest price we&#x27;ve ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you&#x27;re willing to wait a few weeks, it&#x27;s worth locking in this price while it&#x27;s available.

Apple often provides new color options for its silicone and leather case collections seasonally, and with the ‌iPhone 13‌ release, new color options can reasonably be expected.

                    <span>Epic Games has filed an appeal against the ruling in its case against Apple, further prolonging the already year-long legal battle between the two companies. 





The ruling, announced on Friday, sided with Apple on nine out of the ten counts that ‌Epic Games‌ had presented against the company. Epic, from the start, had alleged that Apple is anti-competitive and that it should open up its devices to third-party app stores, third-party in-app payment methods, and more. The judge said that while the trial showed that Apple &quot;is engaging in anticompetitive conduct under California’s competition laws,&quot; ‌Epic Games‌ failed to prove the company is an illegal monopolist or that it violates anti-trust laws.

Responding to a query about new Macs, Gurman tweeted that &quot;there will be two events,&quot; and said he expected the latter to feature both new Mac models and new iPads.

The seventh-rounder from 2015 has had a slow path to prospect relevance, but his recent success at the KHL level got him to the final spot on our rankings.

How did Fedotov’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
Fedotov had his second straight plus season as a goalie in the KHL — generally considered the second-best hockey league in the world — and as such it looks like he’s trending in the right direction. It’s been a slow path to prospect relevance for Fedotov, which is maybe …</span>

And they want your help! 
 Flyers fans, our long national nightmare is over: 
“Feel The Shake” is going away. 
The Flyers have had a long history of many, many goal songs. They have highlighted most of them here, with jumbled letters. For some reason. The Youths probably understand this.

After a long, weird pause, the 25 Under 25 is back for your and our enjoyment.
 After the longest hiatus we’ve had since we did our first-ever BSH Flyers Top 25 Under 25 back in February 2014 (my god, look at some of these names), we’re back with another version. For those of you who partook in our Community Ballot voting, thank you for your input once again. For those of you who didn’t, I’m sorry about your life choices.

 *Just as it was starting to feel like hockey season was in the cool, crisp air... the infamous Second Summer has returned. Alas; we’ve got a few weeks before Fall and a few weeks before the real hockey begins, so enjoy the heat while we have it. Also, enjoy this lovely look at what got Homer into the USA Hockey Hall of Fame last week. [Flyers]
*We’re continuing to work through our player reviews for last season heading into this season, and since we are toward the end we’re getting to the good bits, like Ivan Provorov. [BSH]
*Yeah, the really good bits like uh... Nicolas Aube-Kubel. The real meaty stuff, like 4th liners. [BSH]
*We’re all excited for the Flyers season to get started, but none of us is as excited as Derick Brassard. [NBC Sports Philly]
*This is not at all about the Flyers, but it’s an interesting think piece on what it means to manage expectations heading into the hockey season. [Hockey Wilderness]
*And finally, goalie masks are super cool, and the people that make them are even cooler. Taking a peek behind the curtain? The coolest. [The Athletic]</span>

 F1 2021 got the Algarve International Circuit — racing fans know it as Portimão — with a patch on Monday, and will receive two more tracks free, as promised, in October and November, Codemasters announced Monday.
Portimão, as well as Imola (Autodromo Internazionale Enzo e Dino Ferrari) are two grade one Formula One circuits pressed into emergency duty in 2020 by a COVID-altered racing schedule.

Respawn pumps the brakes on plans to wipe out keyboard-and-mouse tactic
 Apex Legends developers are putting brakes on their plans to eliminate “tap-strafing,” a movement meta-tactic skilled players use to be even more mobile. The studio on Monday said it had “discovered some unexpected side effects” and is “delaying our planned change to a later patch.”
“After further testing, we’ve concluded we need to take more time to get this right to make sure related movement mechanics aren’t caught in the crossfire,” Respawn Entertainment wrote on Twitter.
On Aug. 31, Respawn said tap-strafing’s days were numbered. The move is a hard turn, executed in midair, which is commonly used by keyboard-and-mouse players on Apex Legends’ PC version. The i…</span>

But it does make for good meme fodder
 Streamers broadcasting Life is Strange: True Colors to their audiences are feeling awkward about the lack of music in the game’s streamer mode. The tool itself is designed to mute any copyrighted music that might set off DMCA takedown notices on streaming platforms like Twitch or YouTube — and it does exactly that. Some streamers were surprised to find out, however, that there’s no music to replace what’s been muted.
That makes some seems a bit awkward. Like, for instance, when True Colors star Alex Chen is singing a Radiohead song. As Alex strums away on her guitar in an emotional scene the day she’s reunited with her brother, there’s simply no sound. Alex may think she’s a creep (heh) but we can’t hear it.

Three developers reflect how to better teach Black history in games
 A cartoonish Rick Sanchez, a character from Cartoon Network’s Rick and Morty, stands outside a virtual recreation of The National Mall. In the background, a recording of Martin Luther King Jr.’s historic “I Have a Dream” speech plays. As it screens, other characters run around frantically and do dances like the floss or the robot. 
This discrepancy wasn’t hard to miss at the March Through Time event which launched inside Fortnite on Aug. 26. Event producers told Time magazine (which partnered with Fortnite creators Epic Games to put on the event) they hoped it would, “teach kids about a vital era in American history via a platform they find familiar and engaging.” But Fortnite’s cartoonish natu…</span>

Also Danny Trejo and his obligatory machete
 Far Cry 6’s post-launch content plans involve two crossover missions that jibe with the game’s setting and story, but the third — yet probably the most popular — collab sticks out like a gratuitous product placement: Players will venture into The Upside Down of Stranger Things, to save the little wiener dog you’ve seen in the preview trailers.
At least it’s free. Advertorials should be, after all. Players will also get the obligatory Danny Trejo cameo (con el machete, of course), and a Rambo mission series whose premise sounds like it kinda works? Rambo himself doesn’t drop into the game — it’s a Yaran superfan who, despite the near total cutoff of the island (vis-a-vis Cuba), has followed the 1980s action series and become obsessed with the character.


The three crossovers, coming post launch, led off a roadmap video Ubisoft posted on Friday. Players will also get, free from day one, weekly cooperative multiplayer operations — they’re “insurgencies” and “special ops.”
Of course, this is a Ubisoft joint, so there’s a season pass with premium post-launch stuff, too. As mentioned before, you’ll be going inside the minds of Pagan Min, Vaas, and Joseph Seed to learn more about how those three got so messed up. Expect a lot of surrealism, and a lot of dying, but also a lot of loot?
Far Cry 6 launches Oct. 7 for Amazon Luna, Google Stadia, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. The game was originally due in February, but was delayed as Ubisoft adjusted its COVID-19 development plans. Far Cry 6 stars Giancarlo Esposito as top bad guy Anton Castillo, and the player is Dani Rojas (not the Ted Lasso character, btw), who becomes a guerrilla army of one against the dictator.</span>

Arkane Studios once again pays homage to its lineage
 Deathloop mines a vast array of aesthetic sources, from the medieval architecture of Germany’s Northeim district, to Robin Hardy’s The Wicker Man, to the vibrant fashion of Pierre Cardin. As with all of developer Arkane’s games, it combines divergent inspirations to create a singular universe of its own. And as with all of Arkane’s releases, Deathloop wouldn’t exist were it not for a defunct, and criminally overlooked, game studio from the ’90s. And an Easter egg in its opening moments pays homage to that lineage. 
Like the protagonist of (so) many video games, Deathloop’s Colt begins with a case of amnesia. Filling the shoes of this tabula rasa, I wake up on a beach, with an empty bottl…</span>

Eight birds, one stone.
 Deathloop prides itself on intelligence, in both senses of the word. That is, “the ability to apply knowledge to manipulate one’s environment” and “information concerning an enemy or possible enemy or an area.” There is also a third layer: Intelligence in Deathloop is both diegetic and non-diegetic, as the game’s plot relies on the skills, plotting, and planning of the player character Colt, as well as the skills, plotting, and planning of the player themselves. Watching a character “be” clever is fun, but there is nothing quite like putting the final puzzle piece in yourself and watching the trap you set perform like a finely tuned watch.

The new battle pass also has a cartoon fish and a couple of new Anthropomorphic animals
 The dust has settled from Fortnite’s latest in-game event, and Chapter 2 season 8 has begun, which means there’s a new battle pass full of cosmetics to unlock. 
This time around, the highlight skin is Carnage, the notorious Spider-Man foe, and the villain of the upcoming movie Venom: Let There Be Carnage. Along with his new outfit, Carnage also gets several other cosmetics like a glider, and a trail. Perhaps his coolest feature is the Carnage harvesting tool, which just grows out of his arm thanks to his symbiote powers.

The pass also includes several other skins including Torin, the monster hunter, and J.B. Chimpanski, who is organizing the war effort against this season’s Cube threat. There’s also Fabio Sparklemane, a rainbow-themed anthropomorphic horse, and Charlotte, who gets her own katana harvesting tool. The pass also include a skin called Toona Fish that starts out black and white, but will let you add your own splashes of color later on. 
Fortnite’s latest battle pass is available now and can be purchased for 950 V-Bucks ($9.50). There’s also a free version of the battle pass which allows players to unlock certain rewards and continue to gain experience. The free version of the pass can be upgraded at anytime to the full version without losing any progress. The paid version of the pass also gives players access to all of the challenges, while the free version only offers a limited number.</span>

The return of Kevin and the Cubes
 Fortnite is heading into a new season and the Cubes have taken over the island. After the massive season 7-ending Operation: Sky Fire event, where Dr. Slone betrayed the island’s defenders, the Cubes are spreading across the island. But no one knows why. 
The arrival of this new threat on the island provides most of the mechanical changes for Fortnite Chapter 2 season 8. The new season includes changes to points of interest, new realities to explore, and augmented weapons.
One of the big new additions for season 8 is The Sideways, a new dimension that features lower gravity and various obstacles that make building a little harder. This should encourage players who are inside to always stay on the move. The Sideways also has a fe…</span>

                    <span>Apple will announce its third-generation AirPods, featuring a new design similar to the AirPods Pro but lacking in &quot;Pro&quot; features during its &quot;California streaming&quot; Apple event on Tuesday, September 14, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said today in an investors note obtained by MacRumors. 





Kuo envisions two possible scenarios for how Apple treats the ‌AirPods‌ lineup following the launch of the new model. In the first scenario, Kuo says Apple may price the third-generation ‌AirPods‌ higher than the current second-generation ‌AirPods‌, keeping the existing model in the line. 



Secondly, Apple may reduce the price of the existing ‌AirPods‌ and replace their spot in the lineup with the third-generation ‌AirPods‌ at the current $199 price point. Either way, Kuo says Apple will keep …</span>

                    <span>You’ll read nothing better — or more prescient — about 9/11 than Hunter S. Thompson’s column for ESPN, written 24 hours after the attack:
The towers are gone now, reduced to bloody rubble, along with all
hopes for Peace in Our Time, in the United States or any other
country. Make no mistake about it: We are At War now — with
somebody — and we will stay At War with that mysterious Enemy for
the rest of our lives.
It will be a Religious War, a sort of Christian Jihad, fueled by
religious hatred and led by merciless fanatics on both sides. It
will be guerrilla warfare on a global scale, with no front lines
and no identifiable enemy. Osama bin Laden may be a primitive
“figurehead” — or even dead, for all we know — but whoever put
those All-American jet planes loaded with All-American fuel into
the Twin Towers and the Pentagon did it with chilling precision
and accuracy. The second one was a dead-on bullseye. Straight into
the middle of the skyscraper.
Nothing — even George Bush’s $350 billion “Star Wars” missile
defense system — could have prevented Tuesday’s attack, and it
cost next to nothing to pull off. Fewer than 20 unarmed Suicide
soldiers from some apparently primitive country somewhere on the
other side of the world took out the World Trade Center and half
the Pentagon with three quick and costless strikes on one day. The
efficiency of it was terrifying.
We are going to punish somebody for this attack, but just who or
what will be blown to smithereens for it is hard to say. Maybe
Afghanistan, maybe Pakistan or Iraq, or possibly all three at
once. Who knows? Not even the Generals in what remains of the
Pentagon or the New York papers calling for WAR seem to know who
did it or where to look for them.
The good Dr. Thompson’s voice is sorely missed today.

Nine Favorite Things. I know I’ve said this before, but if you’re looking for a picture-perfect time to visit Colorado, it’s mid-September. I’m not going to go on and on about the weather.

                    <span>Apple&#x27;s biggest product introduction is right around the corner, with an Apple event now officially announced for next Tuesday, September 14! We&#x27;re continuing to see a flurry of rumors about not only the iPhone 13 and Apple Watch Series 7 that we&#x27;re expecting to see at the event, but also the iPhone 14 that&#x27;s a whole year away.





The other major piece of news this week was that a decision was finally handed down in the blockbuster Epic Games v. Apple trial. It was a mixed verdict with Apple winning on nine of the ten counts but the sole Epic victory meaning that U.S. developers would be able to link to alternative payment systems in their apps. But stay tuned, because this dispute isn&#x27;t over yet.

                    <span>WhatsApp has announced it will give its two billion users the option to upload their chat backups to Apple&#x27;s iCloud using password-protected encryption.





Currently, WhatsApp on iPhone lets users back up their chat history to ‌‌iCloud‌‌, but messages and media that users back up aren&#x27;t protected by WhatsApp&#x27;s end-to-end encryption while in ‌‌Apple&#x27;s cloud servers‌.



Given that Apple holds the encryption keys for ‌iCloud‌, a subpoena of Apple or an unauthorized ‌iCloud‌ hack could potentially allow access to WhatsApp messages backed up there. Apple was reportedly pressured to not add encryption to ‌iCloud‌ Backups after the FBI complained.



The upcoming WhatsApp feature will resolve that security vulnerability by allowing users to encrypt and password-protect their chat…</span>

                    <span>Apple today published a new support document warning iPhone users that the cameras on their devices can be damaged by exposure to certain vibrational frequencies such as those generated by high-power motorcycle engines.





‌iPhone‌ camera lenses with optical image stabilization (OIS) or closed-loop autofocus (AF) are susceptible to this damage due to their use of gyroscopes and/or magnetic sensors to help compensate for movement and vibration when shooting photos or video.
The OIS and closed-loop AF systems in iPhone are designed for durability. However, as is the case with many consumer electronics that include systems like OIS, long-term direct exposure to high-amplitude vibrations within certain frequency ranges may degrade the performance of these systems and lead to reduced im…</span>

Together, the new studies indicate overall that vaccines have an
effectiveness of roughly 55 percent against all infections, 80
percent against symptomatic infection, and 90 percent or higher
against hospitalization, noted Ellie Murray, an epidemiologist at
Boston University.
“Those numbers are actually very good,” Dr. Murray said. “The only
group that these data would suggest boosters for, to me, is the
immunocompromised.” […]
Dr. Murray said a booster shot would undoubtedly boost immunity in
an individual, but the added benefit may be minimal — and
obtained just as easily by wearing a mask, or avoiding indoor
dining and crowded bars.
This is like saying we don’t need air bags in addition to seat belts, because the eq…</span>

                    <span>Beth Mole, reporting for Ars Technica:
COVID-19 vaccines are largely holding up against the
hyper-transmissible delta coronavirus variant, particularly when
it comes to preventing severe disease and death, according to
three studies published Friday by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention. […]
In terms of infections, fully vaccinated people were about 11
times less likely to get an infection in the pre-delta period,
compared with the unvaccinated (with a 95 percent confidence
interval of 7.8 to 15.8). That ratio dropped to 4.6 less likely in
the post-delta period (with a 95 percent confidence interval of
2.5 to 8.5).
For hospitalizations prior to delta, fully vaccinated people were
13 times less likely to wind up in the hospital than the
unvaccinated (confidence interval of 11.3 to 15.6). After delta,
that ratio dropped slightly to 10 times less likely (confidence
interval of 8.1 to 13.3). The fully vaccinated were 16.6 times
less likely to die of COVID-19 prior to delta (confidence interval
of 13.5 to 20.4) and 11.3 times less likely to die after delta
(confidence interval of 9.1 to 13.9).
Donald McNeil — the award-winning science reporter formerly of The New York Times — writing a month ago:
Confusion about mask rules is now so great that enforcement
anywhere but on airplanes will be impossible. Requiring weekly
tests as a substitute for vaccination is doomed to fail because
the Delta variant can turn someone from healthy to superspreader
in less than four days.
The key to saving lives is vaccine. The key to reopening offices
and factories is vaccine. The key to reopening schools is vaccine.
The key to keeping bars and restaurants open in cold weather is
vaccine. The key to travel and shopping is vaccine. Vaccine in
everybody.

                    <span>The Texas Switch is a filmmaking technique in which an actor and stunt person are switched seamlessly during a single shot — the actor steps out of the frame or behind a prop and the stunt person steps in (or vice versa). The lack of cutting keeps the narrative going and helps to obscure the switcheroo. The video above contains many great examples. of the technique.

                    <span>Black Film Archive is a collection of links to films made by Black filmmakers &amp; actors from 1915 to 1979 that are available to stream online. Maya Cade writes about why she created this archive.
The films collected on Black Film Archive have something significant to say about the Black experience; speak to Black audiences; and/or have a Black star, writer, producer, or director. This criterion for selection is as broad and inclusive as possible, allowing the site to cover the widest range of what a Black film can be.
The films listed here should be considered in conversation with each other, as visions of Black being on film across time. They express what only film can: social, anthropological, and aesthetic looks at the changing face of Black expression (or white attitudes about Black expression, which are inescapable given the whiteness of decision-makers in the film industry). 
Films, by their very nature, require a connection between creator and audience. This relationship provides a common thread that is understood through conventional and lived knowledge to form thought and to consider. Not every filmmaker is speaking directly to Blackness or Black people or has the intention to. Some films listed carry a Black face to get their message across. But presented here, these films offer a full look into the Black experience, inferred or real, on-screen.


What a great open resource — exactly what the internet is for. You can read more about the archive on Vulture and NPR.

                    <span>Documentaries about mushrooms like Fantastic Fungi are interesting but it turns out that short documentaries about how mushroom documentaries are made are fascinating as well. For this short video, Wired talked to Louie Schwartzberg about how mushroom time lapses are filmed. I don’t know why I assumed they filmed these outside…of course they are done indoors to help control lighting, weather, and other factors (like rogue wildlife). And after decades of working on nature films, Schwartzberg has integrated his process deeply into his life:
I realized I’ve turned it into a spiritual practice. It actually literally gets me up in the morning because as soon as I’m out of bed, I’m thinking ooh, “I wonder what the flower did last night? Is it still in frame? Is it in focus?”
I have to imagine what the framing and the composition is going to look like tomorrow, or two days from now, or a week from now. That is a transformational experience because you have to put your mind into the mindset and the intention of the flower or the fungi, thinking where it’s going to grow, how big will it get. And if you’re right, boy, it’s a rush. If you’re wrong, it means you just gotta do it all over again.


This was surprisingly philosophical in parts.

                    <span>Apple is holding its annual iPhone-centric event on Tuesday, September 14, and like last year, it will be entirely digital. We&#x27;ve been hearing rumors about what&#x27;s coming for many months now, so we have a good idea of what to expect.

We&#x27;re expecting the new iPhone 13 models and Apple Watch Series 7 models to debut at the event, along with new Apple Watch bands and iPhone cases. We could also get the AirPods 3, and there are also other products on the horizon like new iPads and the M1X MacBook Pro, but with Apple rumored to be holding multiple events over the next few months, this one may have more of an iPhone focus.

                    <span>We&#x27;re not expecting new Macs to debut at Apple&#x27;s upcoming &quot;California Streaming&quot; event, but according to Bloomberg&#x27;s Mark Gurman, Apple is making one small tweak to its Mac sales plans.





After the September 14 event, Apple retail stores will begin selling the 24-inch iMac in all colors, which will mean all seven colors will be able to be purchased in store.



Right now, Apple&#x27;s retail stores only offer the ‌iMac‌ in green, pink, blue, and silver. The yellow, orange, and purple colors cannot be purchased in stores and must be ordered online.



The change will make it easier for customers who want one of the more unusual ‌iMac‌ colors to get an ‌iMac‌ right away without having to wait for shipping. It may also mean that third-party stores will be able to carry additional colors, as retailers like Best Buy have also been limited to green, pink, blue, and silver.



There are highly anticipated redesigned 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro models that are in the works, but unfortunately, we are not expecting these new machines at the September event. Instead, Apple will likely hold a second October and/or November event that will focus on Macs and iPads.

                    <span>The first season of basketball-focused TV show &quot;Swagger&quot; is set to premiere on Friday, October 29, Apple announced today.





&quot;Swagger&quot; is a drama series inspired by Brooklyn Nets superstar Kevin Durant&#x27;s childhood and his experience as a talented youth basketball player courted by recruiters.
Inspired by Durant&#x27;s experiences, &quot;Swagger&quot; explores the world of youth basketball, and the players, their families and coaches who walk the fine line between dreams and ambition, and opportunism and corruption. Off the court, the show reveals what it&#x27;s like to grow up in America.
The 10-episode series is set to star Isaiah Hill, O&#x27;Shea Jackson Jr., and Quvenzhané Wallis. Kevin Durant was involved in the show&#x27;s creation alongside Reggie Rock and Brian Grazer.



When the show premieres on October 29, the first three episodes will be available, with new episodes to follow each Friday.



In other Apple TV+ news, John Lithgow has been cast in ‌Apple TV+‌ thriller &quot;Sharper,&quot; and he will star alongside Julianne Moore. &quot;Sharper&quot; follows the story of a woman who cons her way through the world of Manhattan&#x27;s wealthy elite.



Apple has also inked a deal for popular children&#x27;s television show &quot;Yo Gabba Gabba.&quot; Apple is creating a new 20-episode &quot;Yo Gabba Gabba&quot; series and has also acquired the rights to all prior &quot;Yo Gabba Gabba&quot; TV shows and specials.

CaseBorne, rebranded this year from ArmadilloTek, offers a range of different case options that are designed to offer high levels of protection for Apple&#x27;s iPhones, keeping them safe from drops and bumps.



The R Series cases, priced at $30, are made from a clear polycarbonate material that leaves the body of the iPhone visible so you&#x27;re not hiding the device&#x27;s finish.





The cases feature soft rubber inside to absorb shock should the iPhone be dropped, and the case is enclosed in a protective aluminum frame available in iridescent, black, pink, and red. A …</span>

                    <span>The year-long dispute between Epic Games and Apple reached a milestone with Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers delivering a middle-of-the road verdict that isn&#x27;t quite what ‌Epic Games‌ or Apple wanted.





Apple will not be required to support third-party app stores as ‌Epic Games‌ pushed for, but Apple will have to let developers offer &quot;buttons, external links, or other calls to action&quot; to direct customers to in-app purchase alternatives.



In a statement on Twitter, ‌Epic Games‌ CEO Tim Sweeney said that the company was not happy with the verdict, and at the current time, there are no immediate plans for Fortnite to return to the App Store. Sweeney said that today&#x27;s ruling &quot;isn&#x27;t a win&quot; for developers or consumers.

In a 185-page ruling, Judge Rogers said &quot;the Court cannot ultimately conclude that Apple is a monopolist under either federal or state antitrust laws,&quot; but she said the trial &quot;did show that Apple is engaging in anticompetitive conduct under California&#x27;s competition laws.&quot; Rogers concluded that &quot;Apple&#x27;s anti-steering provisions hide critical information from consumers and illegally stifle consumer choice&quot;:

                    <span>Apple has abandoned its plans for a low-cost Apple TV dongle and is set to significantly accelerate and expand the output of new content on Apple TV+ next year, according to The Information.





Sources said to be familiar with Apple&#x27;s plans speaking to The Information have apparently revealed many of the company&#x27;s internal discussions and attitudes around ‌Apple TV+‌ in detail. The company allegedly sees ‌Apple TV+‌ as a standalone business rather than a mechanism to encourage users to buy into the Apple ecosystem. 



The Information reported in 2018 that Apple was working on a low-cost TV dongle device as a more inexpensive alternative to the ‌Apple TV‌, which starts at $149. The project was driven by Tim Twerdahl, an Apple video and audio marketing executive, who argued that…</span>

Kuo said he is optimistic about demand for the Apple Watch in 2022 given that next year&#x27;s Apple Watch Series 8 will offer new health management features, and he predicted this will include body temperature measurement.

                    <span>Apple has announced the creation of a process to properly identify and compensate individual creators involved in making DJ mixes that are streamed on Apple Music (via TechCrunch).





The process reportedly uses technology from Shazam, and Apple is working with major and independent labels to work out a system whereby streaming royalties are fairly divided among DJs, labels, and artists who feature in the mixes.



Since the rise of streaming services, the job of paying rights holders whose music is used in a DJ mix has been a lingering issue. The rise in popularity of the EDM genre has also resulted in an increasing number of remixes, mash-ups, and DJ mixes that incorporate samples from other songs, making working out who should be compensated even harder.

The update brings a raft of previously unavailable Maps features to the regions, including Look Around, lane guidance, speed camera data, 3D buildings, Siri Natural Language Guidance, and improved navigation. The update also adds more detailed road coverage, and faster and more accurate navigation.

During the company&#x27;s third-quarter earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook warned that the chip shortage that has plagued the industry for the last few months would impact iPhone shipments this year. While Cook was likely referencing constraints with the upcoming iPhone 13, the shortage could be creeping onto existing models.



Ahead of an expected refresh or update, the current and soon-to-be last generation devices can be expected to be depleted in stock as Apple makes room for the newer models. As a result, select configurations of the iPhone 11 and iPhone 12 …</span>

                    <span>Apple today added the 16GB fifth-generation iPod touch, released in 2013, to its list of obsolete products.





This specific variation of the ‌iPod touch‌ was released as a lower-end option to the fifth-generation ‌iPod touch‌ released a year earlier. Compared to its 32GB and 64GB companions, the 16GB model was only offered in a single silver color and lacked a rear camera or loop.



Apple followed up the fifth-generation ‌iPod touch‌ with the sixth-generation in the summer of 2015. Compared to the previous generation, the newer model featured improved performance and the removal of the wrist strap. Since the seventh-generation ‌iPod touch‌ released in 2019, Apple has not yet updated its iconic product.



Apple classifies products that have been discontinued for at least seven years as &quot;obsolete,&quot; meaning that they cannot receive any hardware service from Apple or its service providers.

                    <span>Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled today on the Epic v. Apple case. It seems pretty clear to me that Apple got a huge victory, and Epic was served an even huger loss.  But read for yourself. There are three documents:
A one-page judgment, finding for Epic only on the issue of Apple’s anti-steering provision in the App Store Guidelines, and for Apple on all other counts. The judgment also says Epic owes Apple 30 percent of the $12 million Fortnite for iOS garnered while they were using their own in-app payment processing between August and October 2020, and that Epic and Apple must both pay their own legal fees.


A one-page injunction against the aforementioned anti-steering guideline, the meat of which is this:
Apple Inc. and its officers, agents, servants, employees, and any person in active concert or participation with them (“Apple”), are hereby permanently restrained and enjoined from prohibiting developers from (i) including in their apps and their metadata buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms, in addition to In-App Purchasing and (ii) communicating with customers through points of contact obtained voluntarily from customers through account registration within the app.


A 185-page ruling, containing all the findings of fact, etc.

                    <span>Paul Roberts, reporting for The Seattle Times:
In a sign of growing momentum for vaccine mandates, Microsoft has
reversed course and will now require employees to be fully
vaccinated to enter the company’s U.S. offices and other
worksites, starting next month.
The Redmond-based tech giant told employees Tuesday it will
“require proof of vaccination for all employees, vendors, and any
guests entering Microsoft buildings in the U.S.”
The company also said it will have a process to accommodate
employees “who have a medical condition or other protected reason,
such as religion, which prevent them from getting vaccinated.”
Accommodations for medical conditions that preclude being vaccinated are common sense. But fuck these “religious” exemptions. If your “religion” forbids you from being vaccinated, that’s not a religion, that’s a cult.
So where’s Apple on this? Why isn’t Apple requiring proof of vaccination for employees, including for retail employees and customers? Why reserve courageous decisions only for removing headphone jacks?

                    <span>Durham’s City Council staggers its elections and its six council members, plus the mayor, each serve two-year terms. This year, the mayor’s seat is wide open, after incumbent mayor Steve Schewel declined to run for re-election to a third term. Wards I, II, and III also feature races, with incumbent council members seeking re-election in Wards I and II. A primary election for mayor and seats for Wards I and II take place October 5, with the top two vote getters in each race advancing to the general election on November 2. Early voting in Durham’s municipal primary begins next week for these three seats, and we will make endorsements in all three races. The Ward III seat drew only two candidates, so they will automatically advance to the general election ballot. We will not endorse in this race as candidate AJ Williams is the son of our staff writer, Thomasi McDonald, who covers Durham. Read questionnaires from some of the candidates below and check back this Wednesday for our endorsements!</span>

                    <span>Hello! I was talking to a friend yesterday who was studying for a programming
interview and trying to learn some algorithms basics.
The topic of quadratic-time vs linear-time algorithms came up, I thought this
would be fun to write about here because avoiding quadratic-time algorithms
isn’t just important in interviews – it’s sometimes good to know about in real
life too! I’ll explain what a “quadratic-time algorithm is” in a minute :)
here are the 3 things we’ll talk about:
quadratic time functions are WAY WAY WAY slower than linear time functions
sometimes you can make a quadratic algorithm into a linear algorithm by using a hashmap
this is because hashmaps lookups are very fast (instant!)
I’m going to try to keep the math jargon to a minimum and focus on real code
examples and how fast/…</span>

After a fantastic 2019-20 season, Provorov was... fine.
 Ivan Provorov has long been hailed as the crown jewel of Ron Hextall’s rebuild. A defensive prospect billed as the guy who could finally give the Philadelphia Flyers a long-sought replacement for Chris Pronger in the No. 1 defenseman spot, much of the hype for the team’s future rested on his shoulders as he progressed. After a trio of uneven seasons (a promising breakout in 2017-18, horrible regression in 2018-19, and return to form in 2019-20 alongside Matt Niskanen), many considered 2020-21 to be the year that Provorov would finally insert himself into the conversation surrounding the NHL’s best young defenders. Instead, the 24-year-old stagnated, playing like an okay second pair guy ins…</span>

NAKGB? More like NAKG-Bad.
 The Flyers entered the 2020-21 season with a lot of their possible success dependent on the growth of young players. Taking a look at the roster heading into the year, it wasn’t hard to pick out Nicolas Aubé-Kubel as an underrated, yet critical bottom six presence who could elevate his fellow forwards via his combination of relentless forechecking, subtle contributions in transition, and above-average scoring touch. Given the unabashed praise NAK earned from all sides following an excellent debut as an NHL regular (yes, I know Dave Hakstol played him for five minutes in a game the year prior), these expectations weren’t exactly lofty; there was a body of work to base them off of. Instead of meeting or even slightly underac…</span>

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *Big news for Paul Holmgren yesterday as he was named to the United States Hockey Hall of Fame, which is pretty neat and, given all he’s done for the franchise, very well deserved. [Flyers]
*Yesterday we read that Kim Dillabaugh has a lot of faith in Martin Jones, and today we are reading that so does the Flyers’ newest front office member Mike O’Connell. Laying it on thick, boys! [NBC Sports Philly]
*While the whole dang team desperately needs a “bounce-back” year after last season’s mess, these five players are really going to need to turn it around if the Flyers are going to turn it around. [BSH]
*Travis Konecny is one of those guys and he is already hard at work at the Flyers’ practice facility, determined to get back to what we expect of him. [Flyers]
*Part two of Charlie’s interview with Brent Flahr focuses on the Flyers’ prospects at defense and goaltending, at least one of whom will be seriously competing for a roster spot at camp in a few weeks. [The Athletic]
*And finally, just in time for your weekend, a brand new episode of Flyperbole! The Flyers’ Hall of Fame nominees make for a fun conversation; please to enjoy. [BSH]</span>

Welcoming the weekend with Baked Apple Cider Doughnuts with Cinnamon Maple Glaze. Made with boiled down spiced cider, apple butter, and cinnamon. Then baked and dipped in a sweet brown butter glaze flavored with coffee and cinnamon. There’s really nothing not to love about these cute (and sweet) autumn spiced doughnuts. The true secret?

Let me love you, citizens
 No Man’s Sky’s new Frontiers update adds a fun new element to the game: the chance to discover struggling little towns and give them the civic guidance they desperately need. Released in early September with the 3.6 patch, Frontiers doesn’t radically transform the space exploration game, but it adds a nice layer of texture to your usual rounds of exploring planets, completing quests, and fighting Sentinels. There’s just one problem: I want to be friends with my townsfolk, and No Man’s Sky can’t quite let me do that.
When I show up in my new frontier town of Sporeholm, the Vy’keen aliens will wave at me and give me a couple of lines of dialogue where they thank me for my service or complain about Sentinel robots attacking them. I can se…</span>

Operation: Sky Fire is the end of Fortnite Chapter 2 Season 7
 Fortnite’s latest season is coming to an explosive end on Sunday in a massive plot to stop the ongoing alien invasion. To finally destroy the alien threat, developer Epic Games is releasing a new season-ending event that will have players infiltrate The Last Reality and save the world. The event will begin at 4 p.m. EDT on Sunday, Sept. 12. 
The final event of Fortnite Chapter 2 season 7 will be called Operation: Sky Fire and will be a one-time event that all players can participate in, similar to previous events. Unlike some events, however, there will be no replays available for Operation: Sky Fire. The event will take place in its own separate playlist which will go live 30 minutes before the event is set to begin — which is probably when you’ll want to be online, based on the server queues that have happened in the past. 
This new event also comes with a few unique warnings from Epic. According to the developer’s post on the Fortnite website, players should make sure that all of their challenges are completed before the event begins, and that all of their Battle Stars have been redeemed — otherwise they’ll automatically be redeemed, starting with the earliest available unlocks. Players will also need to complete all of their Superman quests before the event if they want to unlock all of his cosmetic goodies. 
Fortnite Chapter 2 season 8 is set to begin sometime after Operation: Sky Fire, but just how soon after, and what happens next, are things we’ll have to find out after the event.</span>

Rest easy, cat fans
 Square Enix gave us our first good look at Forspoken’s story and gameplay during Sony’s PlayStation Showcase on Thursday, showing the brand-new fantasy world being developed by the Final Fantasy 15 team at Luminous Productions. But it was Homer, beloved cat of protagonist Frey, that stole the hearts of viewers. The problem came when fans started wondering, “What’s going to happen to Homer while Frey is out kicking ass the entire game?”
On Twitter and YouTube, fans seemed excited about Forspoken, but concerned about Homer. “What happens to the cat?!?!” they asked. “I need closure for Homer...” one fan pleaded. “I 100% agree with everyone else, I can’t handle the guilt of letting my cat starve to death in my apartment while I play with dragons,” worried another.
But a new tweet from the Forspoken Twitter account has soothed fans.
This is a Homer appreciation post.  
P.S. Promise she&#x27;s OK. pic.twitter.com/wyFXQ0Ue6p
— Forspoken (@Forspoken) September 10, 2021



Homer, the talkative Balinese house cat with big blue eyes, will not be starving to death during your journey as Frey, it seems. While assurances are certainly appreciated for those of us with animal anxiety, it’s still not clear what Homer will be up to. Will she adventure alongside Frey as some of the YouTube comments suggest? Or will Homer get to relax at home with a cat sitter? The answer we’re hoping for is probably quite different than the one Homer would want.
Forspoken is a third-person action game in which Frey enters a mysterious world called Athia and wields a magic bracelet to battle dragons with magic. Forspoken doesn’t have a release date yet, but Square Enix and Luminous Productions will release it for PlayStation 5 and Windows PC sometime in the spring of 2022.</span>

Head to the EDZ for some Exotics
 The weekly Exotic item merchant, Xur, hangs out in random locations around the world of Destiny. In Destiny 2, he can appear all over the map, as well as inside the Tower. This week, you can find Xur in the EDZ, in the Winding Cove, standing on a bluff next to a Fallen Ketch.

Apple loses on a key point of the Fortnite trial
 Apple must stop blocking App Store developers from steering their users to third-party payment options, a federal judge ruled Friday, issuing a permanent injunction in the Epic Games v. Apple lawsuit. 
The injunction is a significant victory for Fortnite maker Epic Games and other developers who have found the App Store’s terms — including the 30% cut of sales that Apple takes — onerous and unmerited. But Apple also claimed victory, in that it prevailed on all other counts, including against Epic’s allegation that Apple’s policies around in-app purchases constituted an illegal monopoly in the payment market f…</span>

The rumors are true. All of them. 
 I’m a fashion mogul, a state representative, and a very important person. I’m standing by the window of my office, staring out at the skyline of Los Santos and smoking a cigarette. My friend Jericho Delmonta ushers a notorious group of ruffians to sit down on my white leather couch. These are the Broker Boys, some of the most violent criminals in all of San Andreas, and I am about to hire them to put my enemies in the river for a series of deeply petty reasons.

                    <span>Because of humans, most of the world’s oyster reefs have disappeared over the last 200 years. Now, some groups around the world are trying to put some of them back. In addition to providing water filtration and habitats for other animals, offshore oyster reefs can help slow long-term erosion by acting as living breakwater structures that partially deflect waves during storm surges.
In the last century, 85% of the world’s oyster reefs have vanished. And we’re only recently beginning to understand what that’s cost us: While they don’t look incredibly appealing from the shore, oysters are vital to bays and waterways around the world. A single oyster can filter up to 50 gallons of water every day. And over time, oysters form incredible reef structures that double as habitats for various species of fish, crabs, and other animals. In their absence, our coastlines have suffered.
Now, several projects from New York to the Gulf of Mexico and Bangladesh are aiming to bring the oysters back. Because not only are oysters vital ecosystems; they can also protect us from the rising oceans by acting as breakwaters, deflecting waves before they hit the shore. It won’t stop the seas from rising — but embracing living shorelines could help protect us from what’s to come.

                    <span>As his name suggests, Jamaican street musician Brushy One String plays a one-string guitar and, under that constraint, makes some truly beautiful music. Josh Jones wrote about Brushy for Open Culture:
When Jamaican musician Andrew Chin, better known as Brushy One String first told friends about his vision — “a dream in which he was told to play the one-string guitar” — they responded with mockery — all but one, who “insisted it was fate,” writes Playing for Change, “and that he had to make that dream come true.” So Brushy set out to do just that, playing on street corners and in the market, “in a big broad hat and sunglasses,” he says. The music came to him naturally. He is no ordinary street musician, however, and his one-string guitar is not a gimmick. Brushy is a talented singer-songwriter, with a powerful voice and a musical sensibility that transcends his bare-bones minimalism.


In addition to his NPR Tiny Desk Concert above, this video of Brushy performing Chicken in The Corn on his one-string has been viewed over 50 million times.

                    <span>Apple VP of technology Kevin Lynch is taking over the Apple Car project and will be replacing Doug Field, who is moving to Ford, reports Bloomberg.





Lynch first joined the Apple Car team in July, with reports suggesting he had been called on to help lead ‌Apple Car‌ development. Now that Field has left the company, Lynch will be taking over his role and will be in charge of the ‌Apple Car‌. Lynch will oversee hardware engineering and work on self-driving car sensors.



Known for his work on the Apple Watch, Lynch has been at Apple since 2013, and before that, he worked at Adobe and helped create Adobe&#x27;s Creative Cloud platform. In addition to working on the ‌Apple Car‌, Lynch is expected to continue to be involved with the Apple Watch and Apple&#x27;s health initiatives.

                    <span>Facebook today launched its first smart glasses, which were created in collaboration with Ray-Ban. The Ray-Ban Stories are priced starting at $299 and come in 20 style combinations.





Smart glasses might suggest augmented reality capabilities, but Facebook&#x27;s Ray-Ban Stories are similar to other connected sunglasses on the market and are limited to making phone calls, snapping photos, and listening to music.



The Ray-Ban Stories are equipped with a set of 5-megapixel cameras built into each side of the frame, which can record photos and 30-second videos using a button or hands-free with the Facebook Assistant.



There&#x27;s a hard-wired LED light that comes on whenever you&#x27;re taking a photo or a video so other people aren&#x27;t caught unaware.

                    <span>Apple offers a bug bounty program that&#x27;s designed to pay security researchers for discovering and reporting critical bugs in Apple operating systems, but researchers are not happy with how it operates or Apple&#x27;s payouts in comparison to other major tech companies, reports The Washington Post.





In interviews with more than two dozen security researchers, The Washington Post collected a number of complaints. Apple is slow to fix bugs, and doesn&#x27;t always pay out what&#x27;s owed.



Apple in 2020 paid out $3.7 million, about half of the $6.7 million that Google paid to researchers, and far less than the $13.6 million Microsoft paid. While other companies like Facebook, Microsoft, and Google highlight security researchers that find major bugs and hold conferences and provide resources…</span>

                    <span>VMware Fusion is now available as a private tech preview for M1 Macs, with users able to request access through an online form. A public tech preview will follow in around two weeks, according to a tweet from VMware Fusion manager Michael Roy.





VMware Fusion for M1 Macs will be quite limited in scope, with a focus on virtualizing Arm-based Linux distributions. VMware Fusion will not officially support Windows 10 on M1 Macs at launch, as Microsoft has yet to offer licensing for the Arm version of Windows 10. In a tweet, Roy said Windows 10 should still run when selecting the &quot;other&quot; operating system type, but VMware will not be shipping drivers or VMware Tools.

                    <span>Apple is developing its electric vehicle independently without the assistance of another automaker and is currently selecting final parts suppliers, according to sources said to be familiar with Apple&#x27;s plans speaking to Korea&#x27;s Maeil Economic Daily.





In line with a previous report from Reuters, the report explains that the company has had its own automobile hardware research and development unit since 2014, but due to development challenges, it contacted BMW, Hyundai, Nissan, and Toyota to explore joint development and contract production agreements.



During this period, its own department for vehicle hardware research and development is believed to have virtually stopped operating around 2016. Separately, software research on self-driving continued.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/09/three-brings-back-eu-roaming-charges/">
                  <div class="article-summary-box-inner">
                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Three has become the latest UK mobile network to reintroduce EU roaming fees, in another post-Brexit setback for customers traveling abroad. 





A flat £2 daily charge when roaming within an EU country will apply to customers who are new or upgrading from October 1. The changes will not come into effect until May 23 2022.



The operator joins EE and Vodafone who have recently announced the return of roaming charges. O2 will continue to offer free roaming across the EU and in the United States, but only on some &quot;Plus Plans&quot; as an extra add-on.



Before the U.K. formally exited the European Union, mobile customers generally didn&#x27;t have to worry about roaming charges when using their phone in the EU, with most phone tariffs counting calls, texts, and data used in EU countries as equivalent to domestic use since 2017.



However, when the EU trade deal was signed in December 2020, mobile operators were once again able to charge customers when traveling in Europe with &quot;transparent and reasonable rates.&quot;



Originally, EE, O2, Three, and Vodafone, representing the largest mobile operators in the U.K., stated they had no plans to reintroduce roaming charges after Brexit, but all have since announced changes, some under a &quot;fair use&quot; clause.

                    <span>WarnerMedia&#x27;s HBO Max is coming to Europe next month, the streaming service has announced. Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Spain, and Andorra will be the first to get access from October 26. 





Next year, another wave of territories will be added to that list: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Slovenia.



Additional territory launches are also planned for next year, but there are currently no plans to launch HBO Max in France, Italy, Germany, and the U.K. This is said to be partly due to WarnerMedia having deals in place with other partners in these countries, where HBO programming is available on services such as Sky Atlantic and Now TV.



HBO Max was officially launched in the U.S. in May 2020, and has since expanded to 39 territories in Latin America and the Caribbean. Like those regions, the above European countries will gain access to content from HBO, Warner Bros., DC, and Cartoon Network.

&quot;This is a historic moment as HBO Max lands in Europe,&quot; said Johannes Larcher, Head of HBO Max International. &quot;WarnerMedia movies and series like Harry Potter, Game of Thrones and The Big Bang Theory are passionately consumed by fans all across Europe, and HBO Max has been created to provide them with the most intuitive and convenient viewing experience to watch these and a diverse range of other amazing titles.&quot;
HBO has yet to say what the cost of the streaming service will be in Europe, but it will make that announcement in a virtual launch scheduled for October.

                    <span>Zeke Miller, reporting for the Associated Press:
In his most forceful pandemic actions and words, President Joe
Biden on Thursday announced sweeping new federal vaccine
requirements affecting as many as 100 million Americans in an
all-out effort to increase COVID-19 vaccinations and curb the
surging delta variant.
Speaking at the White House, Biden sharply criticized the roughly
80 million Americans who are not yet vaccinated, despite months of
availability and incentives.
“We’ve been patient. But our patience is wearing thin, and your
refusal has cost all of us,” he said, all but biting off his
words. The unvaccinated minority “can cause a lot of damage, and
they are.”
More like this, please. Mandate COVID-19 vaccinations for everything. For getting on a flight, for going to school, for eating in a restaurant, for keeping your job. Yes, mandating anything is an extraordinary use of authority, but this pandemic is clearly the most extraordinary crisis most of us have ever lived through. It’s exactly why the federal government has the far more extraordinary power to draft men into the armed services and send them to war: for the greater good.

Los Angeles is the first major school district in the United
States to mandate coronavirus vaccines for students 12 and older
who are attending class in person.
With the Delta variant ripping across the country, the district’s
Board of Education voted, 6-0, to pass the measure on Thursday
afternoon. The Los Angeles Unified School District is the second
largest in the nation, and the mandate would eventually apply to
more than 460,000 students, including some enrolled at independent
charter schools located in district buildings.
More like this, please.

Lynch, an Adobe Inc. veteran who joined Apple in 2013 to run the
software group for the company’s smartwatch and health efforts,
replaced Doug Field as the manager in charge of the car work,
according to people with knowledge of the matter.
The executive first started working on the project earlier this

he is overseeing the whole group, which also includes hardware
engineering and work on self-driving car sensors, said the people,
who asked not to be identified because the move isn’t public.

                    <span>From the city’s website:
Philadelphians use almost 1 billion plastic bags each year, which
litter our streets, waterways, and commercial corridors. Plastic
bags account for over 10,000 hours of lost staff time and pose a
danger to workers at recycling facilities because they get caught
in the equipment. Banning plastic bags will make our city cleaner,
reduce waste and save money.
I’ve been reading Millions, Billions, Zillions by Brian Kernighan (who is apparently a computer scientist of some renown). It’s a great book ($11 in hardcover from Amazon; BookShop.org link to indie booksellers), and Kernighan’s writing style is as buttery smooth as ever. One of the things he does is encourage back-of-the-envelope math on numbers like the above, when you encounter them. Does it make sense that Philadelphians use 1 billion plastic bags per year?
Philly has about 1.6 million residents. 1 billion divided by 1.6 million is 625 plastic bags per person per year, about 12 bags per person per week, or 1.7 bags per person per day. When I consider how often stores double-bag anything vaguely heavy, that seems plausible. (There’s also the fact that Philly gets many tourists, and in normal times there are many non-residents who commute into the city daily for work. Feel free to bump 1.6 million to a higher number, but for ballpark “does this figure make sense” purposes, I think the Census figure is fine.)
10,000 annual hours of lost staff time is high, but seems plausible too: That’s about 192 hours per week, or about 5 full-time employees.

                    <span>Speaking of stuff you can buy from Amazon — with affiliate links that could make me rich — I highly recommend Anker’s small 20-watt Nano chargers. Basically, they’re the size of Apple’s classic 5-watt chargers, and thus fit almost anywhere, but they charge at the same speed as Apple’s much-larger new 20-watt chargers. These new models from Anker come in four colors: white, black, lavender, and sissy blue. If you or anyone you know is getting a new iPhone soon, I would strongly recommend one of Anker’s chargers over Apple’s — same speed, same price, much smaller, and a few color options to top it off.
Another Anker charger I’ve been meaning to recommend is the Atom PowerPort III Slim. It’s a 30-watt charger currently on sale for $19, and what makes it different is that it’s, well, very slim (including folding prongs). This charger will fit behind furniture that’s pushed up against the wall. It’s small and lightweight too — here’s mine next to a matchbox for comparison.

We’ve looked at Flyers ready to breakout, but now it’s time to turn to those looking to bounce back this season.
 The Flyers missed the playoffs in 2020-21 for a myriad of reasons, but perhaps one of the biggest — aside from league-worst goaltending — was that the roster was littered with players who left much to be desired on the ice in terms of production.
Those who didn’t quite live up to the billing fall squarely in the bounce back category. These players, combined with those expected to breakout, should give the Flyers the extra juice needed to get over the hump in a crowded division and back into the Stanley Cup playoffs. 


But enough chatter, let’s dive into five Flyers poised for bounce back seasons in 2021-22 — starting with ar…</span>

 *Big thanks to everyone who voted in our 25-Under-25 poll this week. The results are in and we’ll be revealing the rankings in the coming weeks. One top player who graduated from the 25U25 this year is Travis Sanheim, and he’s a complicated player. [BSH]
*Sticking with prospects here, Charlie’s series on the Flyers’ current crop of prospects continues with part one of his interview with Brent Flahr, who filled us in on how the forwards are progressing. [The Athletic]
*Last season’s reviews roll on, this time we’ve got Samuel Morin. [BSH]
*Our pals over at Fear The Fin took a stab at previewing the upcoming season for the Flyers, with some insight into what we can expect from new backup goalie Martin Jones. [Fear The Fin]
*Speaking of, the Flyers’ goalie coach is extremely confident that Jones is going to turn things around here in Philly. [Inquirer]
*The Metro Division will be without one of its best players to start the season. Which is great for the Flyers. [Pensburgh]
*There are still a number of very talented RFAs without contracts right now. After the whole offer sheet thing the other day you would think there’d be some movement. Not yet! [ProHockeyTalk]
*And finally, a lot of attention is paid to the NHL’s probably-unbreakable records. With good reason! They are pretty amazing, usually! But what about the records that CAN be broken? And probably will be soon? DGBs got you. [The Athletic]</span>

 Sony’s PlayStation Showcase of the newest, biggest games coming to the PlayStation 5 was quite the flex. The 40-minute look at the console’s first- and third-party titles on the way this year and next (and later) provided trailers and announcements for 15 different games.

Boop that sweet doggy nose on Oct. 26
 Eidos-Montréal’s Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is slated for a release date on Oct. 26, but ahead of that date, the developer showed off more of the game during Sony’s PlayStation Showcase 2021.
The new footage showed off a group of heroes that (still) have bad ideas — but good intentions! More importantly, there’s a golden retriever wearing a space suit that talks. Forget about petting dogs. Talking dogs are the future, and the future is now.
Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy was first officially revealed earlier this year at the all-virtual E3 event, but the existence of the game was leaked years earlier. At E3, Eidos-Montréal showcased the single-player, third-person adventure game that lets players take on the role of Star-Lord in a game that’s not a movie adaptation. It’s Eidos-Montréal’s new take on the franchise, with influence coming from existing lore. Though players will operate as Star-Lord, they’ll also be able to lead a team of other Guardians, like Rocket, Groot, Gamora, and Drax. Other familiar characters (and less familiar ones, like Lady Hellbender) will show up, too.
Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.</span>

Borderland’s fantasy-first shooter got a new trailer
 Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands, a Borderlands spinoff, got a new trailer at Sony’s PlayStation Showcase on Thursday. Players got their first look at the fantasy-focused shooter, which looks like Borderlands in a more whimsical setting. Gearbox will release Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X on March 25, 2022.
In addition to the series’ usual, wacky guns, players will also get their hands on crossbows, spell, and melee weapons — albeit with their own Borderlands twist.
Gearbox originally announced Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands at the Summer Games Fest kickoff stream earlier this year. The game will star Ashly Burch in the titular role — which she originally held back in Borderlands 2. Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands will also have an all-star supporting cast, with Andy Samberg as Captain Valentine, Wanda Sykes as Frette the robot, and Will Arnett as the evil Dragon Lord.
Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands will also feature a new character customization system, which will allow players to create a wholly unique protagonist that can fit into multiple class identities. According to Gearbox founder Randy Pitchford, the game has been in and out of development for over 10 years.</span>

Most people missed this key bit of Matrix lore
 The first trailer for The Matrix Resurrections, the first new installment in the dystopian sci-fi action franchise in over 12 years, sent the internet buzzing like an angry swarm of killer Sentinels. Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss return for the four-quel as Neo and Trinity, respectively, along with original trilogy supporting players Jada Pinkett Smith and Lambert Wilson and newcomers like Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and Neil Patrick Harris. But of all the new and old faces seen in the first look at the upcoming film, one iconic character is conspicuously absent: Laurence Fishburne’s Morpheus.
We’ve known since the initial cast announcements dating back as far as 2019 that Fishburne, responsible for playing…</span>

Sloclap follows up Absolver with a night of vengeance
 The action in Sifu is a glorious homage to the best of kung fu filmmaking. The blocks, strikes, parries, and throws all look choreographed, with no wasted motion, no spammed punches winging at the air. If the hero knocks out a foe partway through her (or his) combo, they’ll simply continue the next two or three motions on the next stooge nearby, before backflipping over a table or scrambling up a wall to higher ground.
What is most intriguing to me about Sifu, from Absolver developer Sloclap, is the questions it will ask of the player and of the character they inhabit.

                    <span>I keep tabs on a few trusted film school-ish YouTube channels and while I like when they cover films I’ve seen or those directed by my favorite directors, it’s more valuable when they introduce me to something new. Evan Puschak’s Nerdwriter is a particular favorite guiding light and in his latest video, he talks about Agnès Varda’s Cléo from 5 to 7, a film I now want to watch as soon as possible. A synopsis via Wikipedia:
Cléo from 5 to 7 follows a pop singer through two extraordinary hours in which she awaits the results of a recent biopsy. The film is superficially about a woman coming to terms with her mortality, which is a common auteurist trait for Varda. On a deeper level, Cléo from 5 to 7 confronts the traditionally objectified woman by giving Cléo her own vision. She cannot be constructed through the gaze of others, which is often represented through a motif of reflections and Cléo’s ability to strip her body of “to-be-looked-at-ness” attributes (such as clothing or wigs). Stylistically, Cléo from 5 to 7 mixes documentary and fiction, as had La Pointe Courte. The film represents diegetic action said to occur between 5 and 7 p.m., although its run-time is 89 minutes.


I’ve added Cléo from 5 to 7 to my HBO Max queue but you can also find it on Kanopy (accessible with a library card) and The Criterion Channel.

                    <span>In one of their most popular videos in awhile, kottke.org favorite Kurzgesagt tells us about something I’d never heard of before: giruses. These giant viruses have only been discovered within the last 20 years and are so large and contain so much genetic material that maybe they are actually alive?
Hidden in the microverse all around you, there is a merciless war being fought by the true rulers of this planet, microorganisms. Amoebae, protists, bacteria, archaea and fungi compete for resources and space. And then there are the strange horrors that are viruses, hunting everyone else. Not even being alive, they are the tiniest, most abundant and deadliest beings on earth, killing trillions every day. Not interested in resources, only in living things to take over. Or so we thought. 
It turns out that there are giant viruses that blur the line between life and death — and other viruses hunting them.

                    <span>Peter Gorman of Barely Maps has published a wonderful little book called Kaleidoscope Brain that contains 100 visualizations of Moby-Dick. Gorman read Herman Melville’s masterpiece last year and made these maps &amp; graphics to help him make sense of it.
I read Moby-Dick in April 2020. For weeks afterward, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I started making maps and diagrams as a way to figure it out.
Moby-Dick is infamous for its digressions. Throughout the book, the narrator disrupts the plot with contemplations, calculations, and categorizations. He ruminates on the White Whale, and the ocean, and human psychology, and the night sky, and how it all relates back to the mystery of the unknown. His narration feels like a twisting-turning struggle to explain everything.
Reading Moby-Dick actually made me feel like that-like I’d mentally absorbed its spin-cycle style. I developed a case of “Kaleidoscope Brain.” The maps I was making were obsessive and encyclopedic. They were newer and weirder and they digressed beyond straightforward geography.


The book is available as a free download on Gorman’s Patreon — support his efforts if you find them valuable!

The equipment needs are pretty minimal - a good camera, a couple of lenses, some lighting, and a decent mic. The magic is in the editing.

                    <span>We&#x27;re still a week away from the launch of the iPhone 13, but rumors about the next-generation iPhone 14 models are already circulating and have picked up this week.





We&#x27;ve been hearing about a no-notch hole-punch display design since March, which was reiterated this morning by leaker Jon Prosser. Apple is expected to ditch the notch in favor of a hole-punch camera, and to facilitate that design, display analyst Ross Young says that Apple is also working on an under-display Face ID feature.



Young first shared his predictions for under-display Face ID in June, but highlighted them again today following the earlier ‌iPhone‌ 14 leaks. According to Young, Apple is working on under-display Face ID for the ‌iPhone‌ 14 Pro and Pro Max models.

                    <span>Twitter today announced the launch of a new &quot;Communities&quot; feature that&#x27;s meant to take on Facebook&#x27;s popular Groups by providing a space where people can share discussions on a specific topic.





An invite-only feature at the current time, Communities are created by Twitter users and are self-moderated. Community creators who are invited by Twitter to participate can invite an unlimited number of users to their group.



Members of a Community will see a new option to choose an audience in the tweet composer, allowing them to tweet to all of their followers or just to those followers who participate in the Community.




Communities are invite-only (also for now!) but admins and moderators have unlimited invites and members have 5 invites per Community (again, for now!) that are sent via DM
so choose wisely (3/7) pic.twitter.com/KTDnmhOB8T
— Twitter Communities (@JoinCommunities) September 8, 2021
 


Tweets shared to a Community will show up in the Community and in the timelines of other members of the group. Communities are not private and can be viewed by others on Twitter, but only members can participate.



On iOS devices, Communities can be accessed through the navigation bar, and on the web, there&#x27;s a Communities option on the sidebar.



Starting today, there are a handful of Communities available such as #DogTwitter and #SkinCareTwitter, but Twitter is planning for more to be created each week and those interested in starting a Community can apply on the Twitter website.

                    <span>While we&#x27;re likely just six days away from Apple unveiling the iPhone 13 lineup at its confirmed September 14 event, leaker Jon Prosser has shared alleged details about next year&#x27;s iPhone 14 on his Front Page Tech website.





Key features of the iPhone 14 based on Prosser&#x27;s renders, which were created by Ian Zelbo:
No notch, with a hole-punch front camera instead, in line with information shared by analyst Ming-Chi Kuo


A thicker chassis allowing for no rear camera bump, with the lenses, LED flash, and LiDAR Scanner sitting flush with the rear glass


A titanium frame


Round volume buttons that look similar to those on older iPhone 4 and iPhone 5 models


Redesigned speaker and microphone grilles with elongated mesh cutouts instead of individual holes on the bottom of the device


Lightning connector remains on at least some iPhone 14 models
Prosser provided a closer look at the iPhone 14 renders on his YouTube channel:



Prosser said that while some aspects of the iPhone 14&#x27;s design and dimensions could change between now and the device&#x27;s likely release in September 2022, he is confident that the overall design will remain largely the same when mass production begins.



Prosser was recently accurate about Apple launching a colorful new iMac, and he revealed the design of the AirTag prior to its release, but he has been wrong about the launch timing and pricing of some other Apple products.

                    <span>As a result of legal and regulatory pressures, Apple recently announced some upcoming changes to its App Store policies, such as letting developers email customers about payment options available outside of their iOS app and allowing &quot;reader&quot; apps like Spotify and Netflix to include an in-app link to their website for account signup.





Apple said the changes &quot;will help make the App Store an even better business opportunity for developers,&quot; but Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty believes there will be &quot;minimal financial impact&quot; to Apple. In a research note, she said the changes would result in just a 1-2% hit to Apple&#x27;s earnings per share in the 2022 fiscal year in a worst case scenario.

Weinbach&#x27;s most notable ‌iPhone 13‌ rumors from his latest tweets are listed below:

The ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro Max will feature an 18 to 20 percent larger battery compared to the iPhone 12 Pro Max.


Both the ‌iPhone 13‌ and ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro will continue to use the same battery components as last year, but offer batteries that are 10 percent larger.

                    <span>Amazon today has Apple&#x27;s MagSafe Charger for $29.98, down from $39.00. This sale is just a couple of cents off from the lowest price we&#x27;ve ever seen on this accessory, and it&#x27;s one of the best prices available online this week. It&#x27;s also being matched at Walmart.



Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.



The MagSafe Charger perfectly aligns with the magnets on the iPhone 12 family of devices and provides wireless charging. It also maintains compatibility with Qi charging, so any iPhone 8 or later device can still use it, as well as AirPods with a Wireless Charging Case and AirPods Pro.




$9 OFF
MagSafe Charger for $29.98





For optimal charging, Apple recommends using a 20W USB-C Power Adapter with the MagSafe Charger, but it&#x27;s sold separately. However, Costco members this week can save on both of these accessories when bundled together, priced at $39.99. Individually, the 20W USB-C Power Adapter costs $19.00 and the MagSafe Charger costs $39.00, so you&#x27;re essentially getting the Power Adapter at no extra cost with this deal.



Of course, you&#x27;ll need to be a Costco member to see the deal and be able to purchase it. You&#x27;ll have until September 10 before the sale ends, and there is a limit of two per member. Head to our full Deals Roundup to get caught up with all of the latest deals and discounts that we&#x27;ve been tracking over the past week.

                    <span>Dutch bank de Volksbank has said it is bringing Apple Pay support to all its customers soon, including those of its subsidiary banks, reports iCulture.





De Volksbank is the parent company of SNS, ASN Bank, and RegioBank, all of which operate in the Netherlands. &quot;‌Apple Pay‌ will be made possible for the customers of SNS, ASN Bank and RegioBank,&quot; a De Volksbank spokesperson told iCulture, adding &quot;We can&#x27;t share anything about timing at the moment.&quot;



Over a year and a half ago, SNS Bank indicated that it was in talks with Apple about offering support for ‌Apple Pay‌, but then the bank went silent on the matter. Today&#x27;s development suggests those talks are finally coming to fruition.



‌Apple Pay‌ officially went live in The Netherlands in 2019, with ING leading the charge to bring Apple&#x27;s digital payment system to debit and credit card users in the country.



Since then, other banks including Bunq, Monese, N26, Revolut, ABN AMRO, and Rabobank have all brought Apple Pay support to customers in The Netherlands, which suggested de Volksbank and its parent banks were being left behind. 



According to Apple&#x27;s regional ‌‌Apple Pay‌‌ web page, ‌‌Apple Pay‌‌ can be used in The Netherlands with several online and high street retailers including Adidas, ALDI, Amac, ARKET, BCC, Burger King, Capi, cool blue, COS, Decathlon, Douglas, H&amp;M, Jumbo, Lidl, McDonalds, Starbucks, and others.

Apple last year was hit with a $1.4 billion lawsuit from the Chinese AI firm Xiao-i Robot, which claims Apple violated its patent for a virtual assistant similar to ‌Siri‌. At the time, the firm had asked Apple to cease &quot;manufacturing, using, promising to sell, selling, and importing&quot; all products that &quot;infringe&quot; upon its patent, which would include all devices with ‌Siri‌.

&quot;See what&#x27;s coming in ‌iOS 15‌,&quot; reads the notification. &quot;Learn about new features that will help you stay connected and find focus.&quot;



Tapping the notification takes users on a brief tour of upcoming features, including Voice Isolation, the new Shared With You section in apps, Safari Tab Groups, Live Text in Photos, systemwide translation, Focus mode, notification summaries, and augmented reality walking directions in Maps.



After viewing, the ‌iOS 15‌ preview is showcased in the Collections section of the Tips app, above a similar preview Apple pushed out prior to the release of iOS 14.





Apple is expected to launch ‌iOS 15‌ to the public this month, and new iPhone 13 units will likely ship with a pre-installed version of the operating system.





Historically, Apple has released new iOS versions about a week after its September event, but ‌iOS 14‌ was released one day after Apple&#x27;s September 15 &quot;Time Flies&quot; event in 2020. 





This year&#x27;s &quot;California Streaming&quot; fall event is on September 14, which means if ‌iOS 14‌ is any indicator of the company&#x27;s new release schedule, ‌iOS 15‌ could come out as early as Wednesday, September 15. For all the details on what to expect in ‌iOS 15‌, check out our dedicated roundup.

                    <span>Twitter is testing &quot;edge-to-edge&quot; tweets that span the width of the timeline in its official iOS app, a move that would make viewing photos and videos a more full-screen experience.





As Twitter&#x27;s demonstration shows, the change brings an Instagram-style look to tweeted media, making use of the dead space on either side of pictures, videos, and GIFs. 



Twitter told The Verge that it&#x27;s testing the change because it &quot;wants to better support conversations that are both visual and text-based.&quot; 




Now testing on iOS:
Edge to edge Tweets that span the width of the timeline so your photos, GIFs, and videos can have more room to shine. pic.twitter.com/luAHoPjjlY
— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) September 7, 2021
 


The test is being rolled out today with a limited number of users in order to test feedback, and Twitter has given no indication of when it would go live for all users if reaction to it turned out to be sufficiently positive.

Shipping times for the eighth-generation ‌iPad‌ have slipped into October with three to six week wait times, or are &quot;currently unavailable&quot; in the United States and other online markets, including China, Japan, and some countries in Europe.



With regard to the delays, Bloomberg journalist Mark Gurman says Apple has told retail employees &quot;not to speculate why to consumers.&quot; Gurman adds: &quot;Any guesses why?&quot;



Gurman is alluding to rumors that Apple is near to launching a ninth-generation low-cost a 10.5-inch ‌iPad‌ with an updated A-series chip. The display size is expected to…</span>

                    <span>Mike Lupica, writing for MLB.com:
Jeter was a part of the last Yankee dynasty. His Yankees won four
World Series in five years and nearly made it five in six. In the
middle of all the winning in the late ‘90s for the Yankees of Joe
Torre — the man Jeter calls “Mister Torre” — I was with Jeter
one day at his locker at the old Yankee Stadium.
The Yankees were getting ready for another October, and I said to
him, “You know, this isn’t going to last forever.”
He looked up at me and quietly said, “Why not?”
This was before he made The Flip to get Jeremy Giambi at the plate
in Oakland to save a Yankees season, and before he went 5-for-5 on
the day he got to 3,000 hits with a home run off David Price. But
Jeter was already the player that kids wanted to be. There were
other great Yankees at that time. Still: No. 2 was the one.
And the moment I will always remember best for Jeter, as big and
important and memorable as any he ever had and the old
Stadium ever had, came at the end of Game 4 of the 2001 World
Series, in the middle of three extraordinary nights in the shadow
of 9/11, three nights when the Yankees made a wounded city cheer.
Worth it just for the video clip with Michael Kay’s call: “See ya! See ya! See ya!” Gets you right there.

                    <span>Tyler Kepner, writing for The New York Times, on Derek Jeter’s entry to the Baseball Hall of Fame today:
The next season would end much differently for Jeter: at shortstop
in Yankee Stadium, celebrating his team’s first World Series
title in 18 years. It would ingrain in Jeter a demanding but
matter-of-fact standard, that a season is only successful if it
ends in a championship.
Jeter’s fans loved him for that mentality, and more. […]
He also learned to never make excuses, a lesson embedded in the
Yankee experience. With each passing championship, Jeter said,
Yogi Berra would remind him that he had won a record 10 as a
player. It is tougher to win now, Jeter would protest, citing
modern playoff rounds, but Berra would cut him off.
“His response was: ‘You can come over to my house and count the
rings anytime you want,’” Jeter said. “So I always felt as though
you’re trying to chase something.”
Billy Crystal: “Jeter, simply put, was a winner.”

On the podcast, we talk with Ben about all things app stores. From Apple’s revolutionary launch of the App Store in 2008 to the monopoly-like powers, both Google and Apple now wield today. With multiple lawsuits filed, government investigations ongoing, and developer sentiment at an all-time low, we take an honest look at the challenges and trade-offs in trying to bring two of the world’s largest companies to heal.
This is a great interview with Ben Thompson on all of the big issues currently surrounding Apple&#x27;s App Store. If you&#x27;re a developer on any of Apple&#x27;s platforms, you need to make some time to give this a listen.</span>

Sanheim has quickly become the Flyers’ most polarizing defenseman. What does he bring to the table?
 Seven years after being drafted 17th overall by the Philadelphia Flyers in the 2014 NHL entry draft, Travis Sanheim has become a polarizing figure amongst the fanbase.
The reasons are obvious enough as Sanheim hasn’t exactly cemented himself as a star in the league while seemingly possessing a lot of the tools necessary to do so. From the outside looking in, that’s seemingly caused a large portion of the fanbase to tire of Sanheim over the last few seasons. He’s not a physical player despite being a 6’3” defender, and that seems to be brought up a lot by his detractors, but he’s probably a lot better than he gets credit for.

He was a forward for a little bit!
 It’s hard to separate what Sam Morin was once thought to be with the player he currently is. Not to go and dive into the deep pool of the psychology of fan-thought, but Morin was once thought to be one of the rare players that was set to be the next level of physical defenseman that can still play the game of hockey without their knees combusting every single time they try to skate in smooth strides.
The Philadelphia Flyers certainly drafted him because he was (and still is) a 6-foot-6 defenseman. And as his progression was closely followed, trying to find any answer to the team’s defensive woes in their teenaged prospects, Morin slowly became a post-hype guy that would eventually be thought of being lucky to find …</span>

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *The Flyers announced their newest crop of potential inductees into the franchise Hall of Fame yesterday, and if you ask us? Get Lou Nolan in there or gtfo. What say you? [BSH]
*All of these guys could get in though! Or some! Remains to be seen. [Inquirer]
*Anyhoo, back to Dev Camp real quick: let’s talk standouts. [BSH]
*And while we are talking kids, it’s prospect time over at Charlie’s website this week. First up, his run through of the top-20 best prospects in the organization right now. [The Athletic]
*We’re continuing to look back at how guys performed last year and this time it’s Justin Braun. [BSH]
*As we look ahead to training camp there are a few interesting storylines league-wide that still need wrapping up. [Sportsnet]
*And finally, as we look even further ahead to the Olympics, there are a few Flyers who could plausibly end up on the roster for their respective countries, in our opinion. Which will make watching way more fun. [BSH]</span>

Pick up a game bundle for $10
 A group of game developers has banded together to offer a game bundle on itch.io, with the proceeds going towards relief for people in Louisiana who’ve been impacted by Hurricane Ida. The hurricane was the fifth most powerful storm to ever hit the state, and the clean-up is ongoing. This bundle goes for $10 and includes a buffet of indie games. As of this writing, the sale has raised nearly $17,000 — far exceeding its $5000 goal.


The bundle, which contains games from a variety of creators across Louisiana, will support “a few different charities, nonprofits, and boots-on-the-ground organizations across southeast Louisiana that are already making an impact,” according to the description on itch.io. These organizations include Cajun Navy, Bucket Brigade, and the Louisiana SPCA.
New Blood Interactive, a game dev collective, has also donated $6,660 to the drive, with half of it going to people affected by Ida in New York City. 
This looks like a great way to sample a few different games that you may not have tried otherwise, while also helping a good cause. The offer will expire on Friday, and more games may be added before the end of the sale.</span>

Both literally and in a longterm sense
 Fallout Worlds is a much more customizable take on Fallout 76, one that allows players to twist various dials under the hood of the game. Change the weather on a whim, jump off cliff sides, or set up a little township with your pals. These private servers are meant to be the foundation for future updates, and Bethesda is watching to see how players use these tools and what worlds they begin to build.
At its foundation, Worlds provides options that run along a gradient. On one end of the extreme, you have sandbox silliness. Jump super high, walk through the Wasteland while random enemies constantly chase you around, or fire infinite Fat Man nukes at your friends. On the other end of the spectrum…</span>

The Avengers aren’t done yet
 Marvel’s Avengers is continuing on after its recent War for Wakanda expansion with a new hero and activity type coming later this year. On Wednesday, Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics confirmed that Spider-Man will join Marvel’s Avengers alongside the game’s first raid.
A year after launch, players will finally get a raid in Marvel’s Avengers. Players will battle Klaw, the primary villain of War for Wakanda, in a new and unique boss fight. Crystal Dynamics promised that heroes will battle new enemies in the raid and that this is an entirely new activity type — different from the super-hard Omega Level Threat that launched this Summer.

      The new raid and Spider-Man are the highlights for the rest of 2021
  
Spider-Man, a character that’s exclusive to the PlayStation versions of Marvel’s Avengers, will also be out by the end of this year. Crystal Dynamics originally announced Spider-Man’s exclusivity just before launch last year. While the raid and Spider-Man don’t have exact dates, the promo image for the raid shows Spider-Man swinging toward Klaw. So it seems likely PlayStation players will already have their hands on the web-head before going up against Marvel’s Avengers first big bad.


The road map for the rest of 2021 also includes a host of reworks for the game’s material economy and gear upgrades. Old events will also come back around before the end of this year, and players will see even more skins inspired by the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Crystal Dynamics will reveal more information about its 2022 plans by the end of the year, but it assured Polygon that more Marvel’s Avengers content is coming.</span>

                    <span>Wes Anderson’s tenth film, The French Dispatch, is about a fictional magazine published by a group of Americans in France. The movie’s magazine is based on the New Yorker and in advance of its release, Anderson has published an anthology of articles from the actual New Yorker (and other magazines) that inspired the characters in the film. It’s called An Editor’s Burial.
A glimpse of post-war France through the eyes and words of 14 (mostly) expatriate journalists including Mavis Gallant, James Baldwin, A.J. Liebling, S.N. Behrman, Luc Sante, Joseph Mitchell, and Lillian Ross; plus, portraits of their editors William Shawn and New Yorker founder Harold Ross. Together: they invented modern magazine journalism.

                    <span>Oh, I really like this new NYC subway mosaic installed in the corridor between Times Square and Bryant Park designed by Nick Cave.1 It’s based on Cave’s Soundsuits project, full-body suits that “camouflage the shape of the wearer, enveloping and creating a second skin that hides gender, race, and class, thus compelling the audience to watch without judgment”. From a NY Times piece on the mosaic:
The Soundsuits have always been an amalgam of cultural references, Cave explained: the concepts of shamans and masquerade, obscuring the race, gender and class of the wearer and forging a new identity. They contain ties to Africa, the Caribbean and Haiti.
“It’s very important that you can make references, you can connect to something,” Cave said. “In one of the mosaics in the corridor, there’s a sneaker. So that brings it to this urban, right-now time.”
From beneath a pink-and-black cloak of raffia, carefully crafted out of glass shards, pokes a contemporary sneaker in shades of salmon, white and maroon. Cave likes the play that’s happening here: The form is sometimes figurative, sometimes abstract. “Sometimes it’s identifiable and sometimes it’s not,” he said. “But that’s the beauty of it all.”


(thx, caroline)

No, not that Nick Cave.↩

                    <span>A new unique #AppleEvent &quot;hashflag&quot; has surfaced on Twitter for next week&#x27;s &quot;California Streaming&quot; all-digital Apple event to increase visibility and maximize hype on the social media network.





The custom Twitter hashtag includes a multi-colored Apple logo, and it&#x27;s live as of 1:00 p.m. Pacific Time. 



Apple has used the little icons next to hashtags on Twitter for all its previous events since late last year. The company&#x27;s first use of a hashflag was for its September 2020 event, when it announced the iPad Air and Apple Watch.



Twitter allows brands to add the custom emojis next to hashtags as a marketing strategy. According to Agency Creative, each one can cost upwards of one million dollars, and they are commonly used for large events like the Super Bowl or holidays.



Apple&#x27;s event is set to take place on Tuesday, September 14, where it is expected to announce the new iPhone 13 lineup alongside the Apple Watch Series 7.

                    <span>Doug Field, Apple&#x27;s Vice President of Special Projects, is leaving Apple and abandoning his work on the Apple Car in favor of a position at Ford, Ford announced today.





Field has jumped from company to company in recent years, and since 2018, he has been leading ‌Apple Car‌ development alongside Bob Mansfield and John Giannandrea, who took over leadership for the project in late 2020. Prior to joining Apple in 2018, Field worked at Tesla and oversaw the production of the Model 3.



Before working at Tesla, Field was Apple&#x27;s Vice President of Mac Hardware Engineering, so this is the second time he has departed the Cupertino company. In total, he spent eight and a half years at Apple.

                    <span>One of the splashier car introductions for this year is the relaunch of the iconic Jeep Wagoneer brand as an all-new full-size SUV to compete against the likes of the Cadillac Escalade and Lincoln Navigator. The new 2022 Jeep Wagoneer is also available as a Grand Wagoneer, but rather than being a larger version of an already large SUV, the &quot;Grand&quot; designation is used to represent higher trim lines and some minor changes to styling.





Jeep invited me up to New York City recently to take a look at the Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer, which have gone all-in on technology with up to nine LCD screens scattered throughout the vehicle and new Fire TV integration that takes rear entertainment to the next level.

                    <span>Apple today released a second revised version of the AirTags firmware that was first provided to ‌AirTags‌ owners in late August. The new internal build number is 1A291e, up from 1A291c from the prior revision.





There&#x27;s no word on what&#x27;s included in the new firmware and no new features were found following the first release, so it likely focuses on bug fixes and other under-the-hood improvements.



Apple does not provide an option to force an AirTag update, as it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s done over-the-air through a connected iPhone. To make sure the update happens, you can put your AirTag in range of your ‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌, but you have to wait for the firmware to roll out to your device.



For AirTag firmware releases, Apple appears to have a system that limits the number of people who see the update with each deployment to meter the rollout of the software. Today&#x27;s firmware update jumps to a 25 percent rollout level, up from 10 percent with the prior version of the firmware. 



You can check your current AirTag firmware version using the Find My app, with instructions available in our how to.

                    <span>Hulu today informed customers that it is planning to raise the price of its ad-supported and ad-free on-demand plans by $1, an increase that will impact both new and existing subscribers.





The ad-supported plan, which costs $5.99, is going up to $6.99 per month, while the ad-free plan will be priced at $12.99, up from $11.99. The pricing changes are set to go into effect on October 8.



Pricing on the Disney Bundle that includes access to Hulu ad-supported content, Disney+, and ESPN+ is not changing, and it will continue to be available for $13.99. The Disney Bundle with ad-free Hulu is still $19.99.



Now that there&#x27;s a $1 price difference between the ad-free Hulu subscription and the lower tier Disney Bundle, customers may be more willing to choose the Disney bundle to get access to all three Disney streaming services. As Variety points out, the bundle now provides a 36 percent discount compared to separate subscriptions.



The Hulu + Live TV plans are also not changing in price at this time and continue to start at $64.99 per month.



Hulu has never before raised the price of its ad-supported tier, and in 2019, dropped the cost from $7.99 per month to $5.99 per month. Hulu is still competitively priced with Netflix, which is priced starting at $8.99 for a basic plan and goes all the way up to $17.99 per month for the premium tier.

                    <span>Apple today seeded the ninth beta of the upcoming tvOS 15 update to developers for testing purposes, with the new beta coming one week released the eighth beta.





Developers can download the new tvOS 15 beta by downloading a profile onto the ‌Apple TV‌ using Xcode.



Apple shared little about tvOS 15 when it was unveiled, but there are some new features that are coming to the operating system. SharePlay, a FaceTime feature that lets multiple users watch TV shows or movies together, will integrate with tvOS, and there&#x27;s a new &quot;For All of You&quot; recommendation engine that suggests shows everyone might enjoy.



A Shared With You section also displays movies and shows that were shared with you through the Messages app so you remember to check them out. When paired with AirPods Pro or AirPods Max, the ‌Apple TV‌ supports Spatial audio for a theater-like surround sound experience, and there&#x27;s a new feature for automatically connecting your AirPods through Smart ‌AirPods‌ routing.



Hey Siri commands can be used to launch Apple TV+ shows, and two HomePod mini speakers can be paired with the ‌Apple TV‌ 4K for stereo sound. If you have HomeKit cameras, you can also now view multiple cameras at the same time on the ‌Apple TV‌.

                    <span>Apple this morning announced a digital-only event that will be held on Tuesday, September 14, and if you view the event webpage on an iPhone, you can tap on the logo to open up Apple&#x27;s Safari AR viewer and you&#x27;ll see the three-dimensional logo move in real-time in the real world.





Just open up the event site on an ‌iPhone‌ or iPad and tap right on the logo to open up the AR version. The graphic Apple is using for the event reflects the shining outline of the Apple logo seen in the event invite, and you can use AR to tunnel through it, where a starry night lake scene and the event date are revealed.



Apple often creates graphical experiences for its events, with AR being at the center of recent efforts. In the past, it also had an October iPad event where it created dozens of different Apple logos, and people often analyze event art designs to decipher possible signs of what to expect when it comes to product announcements.

                    <span>Apple today announced that it will be holding a special event on Tuesday, September 14 at 10:00 a.m. The event will take place at the Steve Jobs Theater on the Apple Park campus in Cupertino, California.





As with WWDC and last year&#x27;s fall events, this new event will be held digitally with no members of the media invited to attend in person. Apple will likely provide pre-taped segments for each new product that&#x27;s announced.



Last year&#x27;s September event focused on the Apple Watch after the iPhone was delayed until October, but this year, things are back to normal. We&#x27;re expecting Apple to announce new iPhone 13 models, the Apple Watch Series 7, and possibly the AirPods 3.

Seven years after ‌Apple Pay‌ launched in September 2014, 93.9 percent of consumers with ‌Apple Pay‌ activated on their ‌iPhone‌ do not use it to pay for in-store purchases, meaning that only 6.1 percent do.



In 2015, the year following ‌Apple Pay‌&#x27;s launch, PYMNTS found that ‌Apple Pay‌ usage was just 5.1 percent among those that had the feature activated. This means that ‌Apple Pay‌ usage has only increased by one percentage point in six years.

                    <span>The UK mobile carrier Sky is today teasing the launch of &quot;the next generation,&quot; in what may be a hint at the seemingly impending launch of the iPhone 13 lineup.





The company&#x27;s webpage says that &quot;the next generation is about to land&quot; in an &quot;upcoming big announcement,&quot; and encourages customers to sign up before Tuesday, September 14, to get access to an exclusive Sky Mobile offer.



The promotion has attracted interest since all indications are pointing to Apple planning to hold a digital event on September 14 to announce the ‌iPhone 13‌, Apple Watch Series 7, and third-generation AirPods, which is the same day that the early-bird Sky Mobile offer ends. There is no other sign from Sky that the offer relates to the ‌iPhone 13‌.




We think it&#x27;s time to treat yourself to something new 👀
Sky Mobile customers: if there&#x27;s one good choice you make today, let it be registering your interest to to get all the info on the upcoming announcement, trust us 🎁

Some carriers have been known to provide discounted offers to customers who sign up to a contract for a next-generation iPhone model before it is officially announced, and this marketing appears to be in line with those similar promotions in the past. It is also possible that the announcement relates to something else entirely, but the September 14 date is sufficient proof for some observers that it relates to the ‌iPhone 13‌ lineup.



If the ‌iPhone 13‌ is set to be unveiled next week on September 14 as rumors suggest, invites would likely be sent out later today.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/07/whatsapp-last-seen-hide-from-specific-contacts/">

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>WhatsApp is working on giving users the option to adjust the visibility of their &quot;Last Seen&quot; status on a contact-by-contact basis, according to a new report from forthcoming-feature specialist WABetaInfo.





As regular WhatsApp users will know, the &quot;Last Seen&quot; status of a contact sits atop the conversation thread, informing you when that contact last opened and was active on the app.



Currently, you can disable your &quot;Last Seen&quot; status so that other contacts can&#x27;t see when you were last online, but the setting&#x27;s options are limited to &quot;Everyone,&quot; &quot;My Contacts,&quot; and &quot;Nobody,&quot; and there&#x27;s no way to make exceptions for individual contacts.



However, that looks set to change, based on options unearthed by WABetaInfo in a beta version of WhatsApp. In the Privacy settings, the messaging platform is adding the option &quot;My Contacts Except...&quot; which will let you select specific contacts so that they don&#x27;t see when the last time was that you were active on the messaging network. 





Although it&#x27;s worth noting that if you disable your last seen status for specific contacts, you won&#x27;t be able to see theirs either.



The new &quot;My Contacts Except...&quot; option is also evident in the privacy settings for a user&#x27;s profile picture and &quot;About&quot; information, indicating WhatsApp&#x27;s intention to bring more granular settings to the app&#x27;s privacy options as a whole.



As usual, it&#x27;s unclear when the new options will go live, but given they were discovered on iOS, expect them to appear on iPhone first, with the Android version to follow.

                    <span>Sofia Coppola&#x27;s Apple TV+ comedy &quot;On the Rocks&quot; will be released on Blu-Ray and DVD next month, the first ‌Apple TV+‌ movie to be made available on physical media.





First revealed by Sigmund Judge, &quot;On the Rocks&quot; can be pre-ordered now on Amazon for $17.99. According to the Blu-Ray version information, the physical disc is being distributed by Lionsgate and will ship from October 26, 2021, meaning its exclusivity will no longer be through ‌‌Apple TV+‌‌ on Apple&#x27;s devices and supported TVs and streaming boxes.



&quot;On the Rocks&quot; stars Rashida Jones, Bill Murray, and Marlon Wayans, and tells the story of Laura, a young mother in New York faced with sudden doubts about her marriage.



Laura teams up with her impulsive father Felix, who insists they investigate the situation, leading to an adventure across the city and a generational clash about how people see relationships differently from their parents.



Coppola and Murray last collaborated on 2003&#x27;s &quot;Lost in Translation,&quot; which won Coppola an Academy Award for original screenplay and earned Murray an Oscar nomination for Best Actor.



The only other ‌Apple TV+‌ original available for customers to purchase on Blu-ray and DVD is the drama series &quot;Defending Jacob,&quot; which made the jump to physical media in July, courtesy of Paramount.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/07/anker-nano-pro-20w-adapter/">
                  <div class="article-summary-box-inner">
                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Last October, Anker debuted its 20-watt Anker Nano power adapter, a high-speed charger only slightly larger than Apple&#x27;s standard 5-watt adapter. Ahead of the iPhone 13 launch, Anker today is introducing a refresh for its Anker Nano, which arrives under the name of Anker Nano Pro and comes in four color options: black, white, blue, and purple.





The Anker Nano Pro has a single USB-C port and essentially the same baseline specs as the Anker Nano, but some of the internals have been tweaked to optimize performance and Anker&#x27;s ActiveShield safety system features advanced temperature monitoring and power output control to help protect your device while it&#x27;s fast charging.





The color options for the Anker Nano Pro are part of what Anker says is a &quot;new direction&quot; for the company that will see it expanding beyond the basic black and white options it&#x27;s used on most of its products over the years. Other recent colorful product additions for Anker include the lavender grey and mint green versions of the original Anker Nano, several color options for its PowerLine cables, and even the MagSafe-compatible PowerCore Magnetic 5K.



For those looking for a bit more versatility in Anker&#x27;s lineup of diminutive power adapters, the company is also working on a Nano Pro Dual that will feature 40 watts of charging power and two ports. More information and a launch date for that model will be coming at a later date.



The single-port Anker Nano Pro is available now from Amazon and is priced at $19.99.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/07/magsafe-charger-filing-new-iphones/">
                  <div class="article-summary-box-inner">
                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Apple has referenced four unreleased iPhones in an updated FCC filing for its MagSafe charger, while at the same time referencing the currently released iPhone 12 lineup as &quot;legacy&quot; iPhones. 





The new filing doesn&#x27;t reveal any details about a possible update to the ‌MagSafe‌ charger; instead, the filing only includes updated testing based on new equipment. In the equipment section of the filing, Apple lists four &quot;New Phone&quot; items while also listing A2176, A2172, A2341, and A2342, which correspond to the iPhone 12 mini, ‌iPhone 12‌, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max, respectively, as &quot;legacy&quot; devices.



Earlier in the summer, Apple registered four new iPhone models in the EEC database, providing us with model IDs for the upcoming iPhones. However, today&#x27;s new filing doesn&#x27;t include any model numbers for the &quot;New Phone&quot; items, making it difficult to tie a connection between the filing and the EEC entry.



Amongst the features expected for the iPhone 13, Apple is expected to be improving the strength of the MagSafe magnets on the back of the new iPhones. While the filing doesn&#x27;t confirm that, Apple may have needed to retest the charger as per FCC regulation on the new iPhones, given their stronger ‌MagSafe‌ system than the 2020 lineup. 



Apple is widely expected to be holding an all-digital event next week on Tuesday, September 14, where it will announce the ‌iPhone 13‌ as well as the Apple Watch Series 7. Apple may confirm the event as early as Tuesday.

                    <span>Michael Wayland, reporting for CNBC:
Ford Motor said Tuesday it hired former Tesla and Apple executive
Doug Field to lead its emerging technology efforts, a key focus
for the automaker under its new Ford+ turnaround plan.
Field — who led development of Tesla’s Model 3 — most recently
served as vice president of special projects at Apple, which
reportedly included the tech giant’s Titan car project.
The hire is a major addition for Ford and a big hit to Apple
and its secret car project, which the company has yet to
confirm exists.
Maybe it’s as simple as Field wanting to work on something that’s actually going to ship?

                    <span>David Leonhardt, writing for The New York Times:
The estimates here are based on statistics from three places that
have reported detailed data on Covid infections by vaccination
status: Utah; Virginia; and King County, which includes Seattle,
in Washington state. All three are consistent with the idea that
about one in 5,000 vaccinated Americans have tested positive for
Covid each day in recent weeks.
The chances are surely higher in the places with the worst Covid
outbreaks, like the Southeast. And in places with many fewer
cases — like the Northeast, as well as the Chicago, Los Angeles
and San Francisco areas — the chances are lower, probably less
than 1 in 10,000. That’s what the Seattle data shows, for
example. (These numbers don’t include undiagnosed cases, which
are often so mild that people do not notice them and do not pass
the virus to anyone else.)
Here’s one way to think about a one-in-10,000 daily chance: It
would take more than three months for the combined risk to reach
just 1 percent.
Breakthrough cases for the vaccinated are far more rare than many people have been led to believe through clickbait headlines.

                    <span>Karen Webster, writing for the oddly-named Pymnts:
Seven years post-launch, new PYMNTS data shows that 93.9% of
consumers with Apple Pay activated on their iPhones do not use it
in-store to pay for purchases.
That means only 6.1% do.
That finding is based on PYMNTS’ national study of 3,671 U.S.
consumers conducted between Aug. 3-10, 2021. After seven years,
Apple Pay’s adoption and usage isn’t much larger than it was 2015
(5.1%), a year after its launch, and is the same as it was in
2019, the last full year before the pandemic.
It doesn’t really make sense to me that adoption isn’t much higher than it was in 2015, and if these survey results are accurate, I find them surprisingly low. I’d have guessed somewhere in the 15–20 percent range. If it’s true adoption is this low, I think one factor could be first impressions — my wife got turned off by Apple Pay in the earlier years because so many retail terminals that supposedly accepted it were so finicky. Using an old-fashioned credit card was more reliable. Also, habits. But I use Apple Pay today whenever I can, and I find it more reliable than tap-and-pay with a physical card.
Nick Heer, writing at Pixel Envy:
This survey shows an approximately flat use rate from 2019 through
2021, down slightly from 2018. Webster writes that the pandemic
ought to have “changed the trajectory of Apple Pay” as
“contactless and touchless have become the consumer’s checkout
mantra”. But anyone with a Face ID-equipped iPhone can tell you
that wearing a mask requires you to authenticate by using your
passcode, so it has been far easier for the past eighteen months
to simply tap a card. That is probably true generally, as well;
Apple Pay may have better privacy and security, but it is no
easier to use than a card that supports tap to pay, even without
the added complication of pandemic precautions.
Apple Pay with Apple Watch works well while wearing a face mask, but using your iPhone sucks.

                    <span>A virtual event — which is not the least bit surprising but still a bit of a bummer. No guess from me as to what, if anything, the invitation means. Here’s Greg Joswiak’s tweet, which has a brief video teaser.
Update: And there’s another nifty AR Easter egg on Apple’s main events page, viewable from an iPhone.

A surprise retirement forced Braun to return and be the old guy on the blue line.
 The moment Matt Niskanen retired, the stop-gap solution was quickly taken, gobbled up like a last piece of ham and stuffed down your hole, and that ham was Justin Braun. The elder veteran of the blue line that was acquired for a couple draft picks from the San Jose Sharks the summer prior, was on an expiring deal and while it might have made sense just to let him walk, with another established right-handed shot parting ways with the NHL, then it kind of fit that they just brought back this dude that they’re already familiar with.
Signing a two-year deal, Braun was given a little bit of a longer commitment than normal for a 34-year-old blueliner, but they must have just…</span>

Let’s talk prospects!
 At long last! The Flyers’ Development Camp made its triumphant return last week, and though not everyone was able to make it, it was still a great chance to check in with a number of prospects for the first time in a little while, and for some, the first time ever. We’ve got lots of notes to get to, so let’s get right into it. 
Five stars
Tyson Foerster
If we’re looking for someone who, while not having come into camp with the most buzz, very quickly asserted himself as one of the biggest standouts, Foerster would be your guy. 
One of the first bits to note is that his skating already looks a bit better. This was something that was talked a lot about after he was drafted as being an issue, and while, after watching him with the Phantoms la…</span>

NHL players are officially returning to the Winter Olympics, and several Flyers players could end up representing their countries in Beijing.
 It’s official. The NHL and NHLPA announced Friday that they have reached an agreement with the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) allowing NHL players to participate in the upcoming Winter Olympics in Beijing after they were unable to compete in Pyeongchang.
This news hardly comes as a surprise as the NHL went so far as to include a two-week Olympic break during its regular-season schedule in order to accommodate their inevitable agreement with the IIHF.
With NHL players returning to the Olympics, this could mean that multiple Flyers players will be headed overseas to represent their countr…</span>

Well with the unofficial end of Summer behind us, we’ve got nothing to do but look forward to the rapidly approaching season. First up will be training camp, and a few young players are going to have to earn a spot if they want one, because right now they’re all filled up. [NBC Sports Philly]
*Speaking of young players, the Flyers took a big bet on Joel Farabee and while we’ll have to wait to see how it pans out, Charlie breaks down all the reasons why it was a good bet to make regardless. [The Athletic]
*We learned the the NHL will definitely officially be sending players to the Olympics this year, and we may see a couple of Flyers, which is fun. [Inquirer]
*Despite the agreement between the IIHF and the league coming to fruition, there’s still work to be done there. [ProHockeyTalk]
*Anyhoo, back to the Flyers. Predictions are starting to happen and some folks seem to think that the Metro might end up being a super tight race for the playoffs. Again. [Pensburgh]
*Despite this big impressive offseason, Chuck Fletcher is still considered a middle-of-the-pack general manager. He may just prove that wrong though! [ProHockeyTalk]
*The Habs didn’t match the Kotkaniemi offer sheet — shocking! — so he’s a Canes now. [Canes Country]
*And finally, a brand spanking new Flyperbole!! Perfect for a fake Monday. [BSH]</span>

Sledgehammer calls Vanguard ‘the most tactical experience you’ve ever had in Call of Duty’
 This year’s Call of Duty will introduce new environmental destruction features in multiplayer, developer Sledgehammer Games said during a reveal stream on Tuesday, which will change the layout and flow of Call of Duty: Vanguard’s maps. Players also have another reason to be wary even while they’re behind cover: One of the game’s multiplayer weapon perks will let players see their opponents through walls in certain situations.
In the video reveal for Call of Duty: Vanguard’s multiplayer, Sledgehammer developers discussed the breadth of competitive modes coming in this year’s game. During one section featuring multiplayer creative director Greg Reisdorf, l…</span>

The new map will run on the same engine as Vanguard
 Raven Software has released the first new details on Call of Duty: Warzone’s upcoming map, which will be set in the Pacific.  The developer revealed the new information, along with a few screenshots, on Tuesday, during Call of Duty: Vanguard’s multiplayer reveal stream.
Like everything related to Vanguard, Warzone’s new map will be World War II-themed. The map is set in the Pacific, on an island with dense foliage and a few small towns and cities for players to fight in. Based on the early footage, it seems like the map will be a lot more tropical than Verdansk, and should feature more fighting in the jungles than the more urban settings of previous maps. 
The new Warzone map will also run on the same engine as Call of Duty: Vanguard — which is essentially the same engine as Modern Warfare and the original version of Warzone’s Verdansk. According to Raven Software, this means that the game will easily integrate with Vanguard, including its weapons and gameplay style, which should be present on the new Pacific theater map when it’s released sometime later this fall. 
The other major Warzone update that Raven Software offered on Tuesday was an update about the game’s new anti-cheat system. Unfortunately, that update didn’t really contain any new or meaningful details. But with Warzone cheating as bad as it’s been recently, it’s nice to hear that Raven is still hard at work on the new system. In a Call of Duty blog post on Tuesday, Raven called the system a “multifaceted new anti-cheat system for PC,” and explained that it’s still testing the system at the moment, but that it should be ready for Warzone’s Pacific map launch.

The skins change as you move and include plenty of music
 Riot has announced the latest line of weapon skins for Valorant, but the developer had some help this time around. For this batch, Riot collaborated with EDM artist Zedd to make a line up of musically infused weapon varieties. 
The skin line will be called Spectrum, and Riot debuted the first look at each of the guns on Tuesday. The bundle includes skins for the Phantom, Guardian, Bulldog and Classic weapons, as well as for the knife melee weapon. Each skin has three variant colors (purple, red, and black) and a few upgrades, which players can unlock with Radianite Points. 
The skins’ base variety is a sleek white with bright LEDs on the side, which change colors as you move, like the lights in a club. Spectrum skins also have unique animations for kills, a variety of unique firing sounds, and their round-finisher upgrade turns the map into a giant dance party. 
This latest skin line isn’t the first time that Riot has collaborated with Zedd either. Back in 2016, the artist did the theme song for that year’s League of Legends World Championship — a track that remains a favorite of League fans today. While Riot has made plenty of exciting skins in the past, Spectrum seems to have some of the most complicated cosmetics the developer has ever made for Valorant. They’re definitely the most in-depth since last year’s Elderflame skins.
The Spectrum skin line is set to arrive in the Valorant in-game store on Wednesday, a day before the game’s new map, Fracture, will be released. The bundle, which includes all the skins, two gun buddies, a player card, and a spray, will cost a whopping 10,700 Valorant Points. For some perspective there, 11,000 Valorant Points costs $99.99.</span>

World Update 6 will also include a new terrain setting for high-performance PCs
 Microsoft Flight Simulator’s next big update enhances the look of Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. Called World Update 6, developers showed off a new trailer during the annual Gamescom gaming convention. The free update launches on Sept. 7 for Windows PC and Xbox.
Head of Microsoft Flight Simulator Jorg Neumann tells Polygon that this particular World Update contains some of the most current data that’s ever been added to the game.
“We pick a region when we have great data: new satellite data, new aerial data,” Neumann said. “In this case, we have new aerials and satellite from 2020, so it’s what we call ‘fresh.’ And then we work with, oftentimes, the [regional …</span>

TSMC, Apple&#x27;s main chip supplier, is in the process of increasing its prices following wider inflation in the industry caused by the global chip supply shortage. The company&#x27;s planned price rises are said to be the most substantial chip price hikes in a decade.



TSMC&#x27;s chips were already around 20 percent more expensive than those from its direct rivals, but smaller foundries have ramped up their own prices due to higher material and logistics costs, and TSMC has committed to $100 billion in new investment over the next three years, motivating the company to increase its prices to maintain its premium and pass these added cos…</span>

                    <span>Drake&#x27;s latest album &quot;Certified Lover Boy&quot; is Apple Music&#x27;s most-streamed album in 24 hours in the services&#x27; history, Apple revealed to Billboard over the weekend.



 

The album was released at midnight EST on Friday, September 3, and is the sixth studio album from the artist. It features a number of prominent rappers, including Jay-Z, Lil Wayne, Future, Rick Ross, and Lil Baby.



&quot;Certified Lover Boy&quot; is a 21-track album and features Apple&#x27;s pregnant woman emojis on its album cover. The cover notes describe the album as &quot;a combination of toxic masculinity and acceptance of truth which is inevitably heartbreaking,&quot; and is executive produced by Drake, Noah “40” Shebib, Oliver El-Khatib and Noel Cadastre. 



The album had already reportedly broke the record for the most-streamed album in 2021 in under 12 hours on the service.



The new record comes just three days after Kanye West&#x27;s &quot;Donda&quot; broke Apple Music&#x27;s day-one streams record for 2021 with 60 million plays in the United States.

                    <span>Taiwan&#x27;s Railways Administration (TRA) has officially announced support for using Apple Pay when purchasing train tickets with the service&#x27;s e-booking mobile app.





In a press release on its website, the country&#x27;s railway operator said it was making the new &quot;‌Apple Pay‌ ticketing service&quot; available from September 7 in order to improve convenience for passengers when booking tickets via the official mobile app.



After passing the initial verification, the payment procedure will be completed via ‌Apple Pay‌, saving users the time it takes to enter their credit card number, said the operator.



Alongside ‌Apple Pay‌ support, the TRA&#x27;s new membership system is launching a reward scheme where passengers can accumulate redeemable points for using the mobile ticket purchasing mechanism. 



Every 50 NT dollar spent is converted into 1 point, and every 2 points points can be redeemed to earn up to a 30% discount on the price of a ticket. Originally, the scheme was only open at the physical ticket windows where points could be used to buy train tickets, but the mobile app now supports the feature, too.

                    <span>A now-deleted video purporting to show official Apple silicone cases for the &quot;iPhone 13 Pro Max&quot; appears to corroborate the &quot;‌iPhone 13‌&quot; naming convention for the company&#x27;s upcoming 2021 iPhone lineup.

Originally shared online last week by Twitter account @PinkDon1, the video shows a batch of silicone cases in white boxes, held together by elastic bands, with the labels reading &quot;‌iPhone 13‌ Pro Max Silicone Case&quot; along with the MagSafe branding below it.

In the latest edition of his Power On newsletter, Gurman outlines three potential outcomes of Apple&#x27;s production headaches: The company delays its Apple Watch announcement until the production issues are resolved, it goes ahead with the announcement and makes the Series 7 available in limited quantities, or Apple announces the watch but doesn&#x27;t make it available until a later date.

                    <span>Apple&#x27;s Safari app has undergone a number of changes during the iOS 15 beta testing process. Apple started out with a radical new design that moved the address bar from the top of the app&#x27;s interface and introduced a floating tab bar, but after a multitude of complaints, there were several redesigns that culminated in an option to undo the ‌iOS 15‌ design entirely.





This guide walks through all of the features added in the ‌iOS 15‌ Safari app, including those new design options.



Design Changes


Safari started out with a new floating tab design that moved the address bar and tabs to the bottom of the iPhone interface, but now the design change is optional.





In the Safari section of the Settings app, you can choose your tab view. The &quot;Tab Bar&quot; option moves the a…</span>

                    <span>A former Chrysler proving grounds for automotive testing outside of Phoenix, Arizona, that has been rumored to be used by Apple was recently purchased for $125 million by the firm that has been leasing it for the past five years, according to AZ Big Media.





Back in 2017, it was reported that a company by the name of Route 14 Investment Partners LLC had signed a lease to use the facility, with rumors suggesting Apple was behind the deal, although there was no definitive proof of the link. Route 14 is represented by the Phoenix office of law firm Greenberg Traurig, hiding the true ownership of the company.



Route 14 has now exercised an option to purchase the property, which consists of 34 separate parcels, for $125 million in cash. The purchase agreement is dated June 25, 2021, with a deed and assumption of an existing development agreement with the City of Surprise both dated July 30 and seen by MacRumors.





We have still not been able to concretely tie Apple to Route 14, but it&#x27;s clear that whoever is behind the firm has deep pockets and a long-term interest in the testing facility.



Rumors about Apple&#x27;s work on both autonomous driving systems and actual electric vehicles have ebbed and flowed over the last several years. The most recent report just this week claimed that Apple has been visiting with Toyota as it seeks to develop a supplier network with an eye toward producing an Apple-branded car starting in 2024.

                    <span>Apple has hired two former Mercedes engineers to join the company, likely as part of its effort to continue to build out its internal workforce as the development of an &quot;Apple Car&quot; continues.





The leading new hire previously worked at Mercedes, focusing on mass production of vehicles, vehicle steering, dynamics, and software and project management. The hire, now working as a product design engineer at Apple at its &quot;Special Projects Group,&quot; also previously worked at Porsche, undertaking similar responsibilities. A second engineer who previously worked at Mercedes has also recently been tapped by Apple to join the company, MacRumors has learned.

                    <span>Apple has delayed the rollout of the Child Safety Features that it announced last month following negative feedback, the company has today announced.





The planned features include scanning users&#x27; iCloud Photos libraries for Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM), Communication Safety to warn children and their parents when receiving or sending sexually explicit photos, and expanded CSAM guidance in Siri and Search.



Apple confirmed that feedback from customers, non-profit and advocacy groups, researchers, and others about the plans has prompted the delay to give the company time to make improvements. Apple issued the following statement about its decision:

                    <span>YouTube says it has passed 50 million subscribers for its Premium and Music subscriptions, making it the &quot;fastest growing music subscription&quot; service in the world, according to YouTube&#x27;s global head of music, Lyor Cohen. 





YouTube says that it has more than 50 million paying subscribers collectively across YouTube Premium and YouTube Music. The Google-owned service says it attributes this milestone to several factors, but mainly due to how subscribers can get &quot;uninterrupted access to the largest and most diverse catalogue of music, artists and culture&quot; through its subscriptions.

We&#x27;ve got killer products in YouTube Music and YouTube Premium that deliver truly unique value to artists and creators and the best experience for music fans and video lovers. We&#x27;re in our own lane -- there&#x27;s no other place where fans can get uninterrupted access to the largest and most diverse catalogue of music, artists and culture. We&#x27;re making it easy for music fans to go deep and find their thing -- whether that&#x27;s on YouTube or the YouTube Music app. 
YouTube Music comes as part of a YouTube Premium subscription but can also be purchased standalone. With YouTube Premium, customers can download videos for offline viewing, play videos in the background playback, no ads, and more. 



YouTube Music is one of many competitors to Apple Music, and it&#x27;s hard to name a winner purely based on subscriber count. Apple doesn&#x27;t provide specific subscriber figures, but the latest estimate was 60 million subscribers in 2019. Three years on, the number is likely higher. Additionally, Apple One, which bundles ‌Apple Music‌ with other Apple&#x27;s services, makes it harder to determine how many ‌Apple Music‌ subscribers are out there.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/03/apple-alternative-arm-architecture/">

                    <span>Apple may be exploring the possibility of using an open-source alternative to the Arm architecture, which it&#x27;s been using in its products for decades.





According to a newly posted job alert, spotted by Tom&#x27;s Hardware, Apple is looking for an engineer that specializes in RISC-V, an open-source architecture instruction set that allows device makers to build their own chips without having to pay a license or royalty. Apple currently uses the Arm architecture in its products, and it pays the company a royalty fee to use its instruction set. 



Apple&#x27;s job posting description states that the engineer will implement &quot;innovative RISC-V solutions and state of the art routines&quot; to Apple&#x27;s products. Specifically, Apple hopes prospective engineers will be able to work with the RISC-V instruction set, as well as have an understanding of Arm. 



Tom&#x27;s Hardware theorizes that if Apple were to adopt the open-source instruction set of RISC-V, it may save the company money because it wouldn&#x27;t need to pay Arm a license fee for its instruction set.

Every Arm core requires Apple to pay a licensing fee to Arm, and since the number of cores for things like SSD controllers and smartwatches will only increase, so will Apple&#x27;s payments to Arm. As such, replacing at least some Arm cores with RISC-V cores could save Apple millions of dollars in royalty payments every year...
The job listing is a confirmation that Apple is exploring the use of RISC-V, but whether the company decides to implement the open-source technology remains to be seen. Apple&#x27;s reliance on Arm has increased in the past year as Apple is in the process of switching its Mac lineup to Arm-based processors rather than Intel.

                    <span>Twitter is planning new privacy-related features that provide users with greater control over follower lists and who can see their posts and likes, reports Bloomberg.





The plans are said to include an option to archive old tweets so that other users can&#x27;t see them after a set period of time designated by the account holder (such as 30, 60, or 90 days, or a whole year), as well as the ability to edit follower lists.



According to Bloomberg, the plans are an effort to make people more comfortable interacting and sharing on Twitter, and are related to what Twitter executives call &quot;social privacy,&quot; or how users manage their identities and reputations on the social network. 



Internal research at the company reportedly found that many Twitter users don&#x27;t understand the privacy basics, like whether their account is private or public, which causes them to engage less on the social network because they don&#x27;t know what other people will be able to see about them.



To counter this, Twitter will start prompting users to review whether their accounts are public or private beginning in September. Its privacy team are also working on other potential changes including the ability to remove followers (as opposed to blocking them), hide liked tweets, and remove oneself from a public conversation. 



Twitter has no timeline for some of the changes, while some features, like the archive option, are still in the &quot;concept phase,&quot; but Twitter plans to let people remove followers starting this month, and to let users remove themselves from conversations by the end of the year.

Today we have the very first teaser for Pereira’s indie feature The Chamber of Terror, which hits the festival scene soon. “The […]</span>

                    <span>Here’s a perfect example of what I was talking about in the previous item, about The Wirecutter institutionally fetishizing price over quality. And within “quality” I include design aesthetics, which, let’s face it, almost always goes hand-in-hand with price.
From their current list of “best” drip coffee makers, which is topped by OXO’s $200 Brew 9-Cup:
You can find a number of expensive, stylish coffee makers made in
small quantities for enthusiast audiences. Clive Coffee’s Ratio
Eight and the Chemex Ottomatic are two prominent
examples. They’re all made for connoisseurs who are willing to
spend a lot on a high-end machine. The main draw of these coffee
makers is that they brew similarly to manually making a batch of
pour-over — pre-infusing the grounds and evenly pouring the hot
water. F…</span>

                    <span>The New York Times:
The New York Times Company announced today that Wirecutter, its
product recommendation service, will institute a metered paywall,
asking its frequent users to subscribe for unlimited access to its
research and recommendations. New York Times All Access digital
and home delivery subscribers will continue to receive unlimited
access to Wirecutter’s 1,200+ product reviews, deals coverage and
other guides to help them shop confidently online with their
existing subscription. A standalone subscription to Wirecutter is
available for $5 every four weeks or $40 annually.
This makes sense, and in my opinion, the Times’s paywall rules are among the best in the industry, in terms of offering a generous number of free reads to non-subscribers. But it’s one less “free for everyone to read” high-quality site.
(I have always enjoyed Wirecutter, going back to when they debuted (and had a leading The), but I wish they had a rival that focused less on price. Wirecutter recommendations are very often skewed to the best low-priced product, not the best product in a category, period. I want domain experts to tell me the best products — I can make up my own mind on how much I want to spend.)

                    <span>Jane Manchun Wong:
Each Super Follow is an In-App Purchase on the App Store, but
because there are too many IAPs for the Twitter app, the App Store
only shows 10 instead of the full list.
Her tweet includes this screenshot. The gist is, each Twitter user offering Super Follows gets its own distinct IAP. If there are 1,000 users offering Super Follows, there are 1,000 discrete IAPs in the App Store. If there are 10,000 users offering them, 10,000 IAPs. If there are 100,000, our heads explode.
This is incredible. Ostensibly, Twitter is doing what Apple wants them to do. Right now Super Follows payments are even exclusive to iOS. (Once you pay on iOS, you can see Super Follow content on Twitter’s Android and web clients, too, but the only way to pay is on iOS through IAP.) But Apple’s IAP system is so brittle that Twitter has to make a discrete SKU for each and every Super Follow user, and pay Apple 30 percent of the price for the privilege. (Twitter, per its published terms, takes just 3 percent of the first $50,000 in lifetime earnings, then 20 percent after that.) Also, because Apple’s IAP listings in the App Store rank IAP offerings by popularity, Twitter is being forced to reveal data that they quite likely would prefer to keep to themselves.

Apple spokesman Fred Sainz said he would not provide a statement
on Friday’s announcement because The Washington Post would not
agree to use it without naming the spokesperson.
Fair enough, I suppose, but Albergotti’s blinders have become rather obvious.

                    <span>Apple, in a statement to the media this morning:
Last month we announced plans for features intended to help
protect children from predators who use communication tools to
recruit and exploit them, and limit the spread of Child Sexual
Abuse Material. Based on feedback from customers, advocacy groups,
researchers and others, we have decided to take additional time
over the coming months to collect input and make improvements
before releasing these critically important child safety features.
Accepting feedback and considering that feedback is exactly why they announced these two initiatives in advance, with details, rather than just launching them. Neither of these initiatives should be rushed.

The call was for a vehicle in floodwaters on Route 518 in Hopewell
Township — one of many rescue calls in New Jersey Wednesday
evening as storms from Hurricane Ida flooded the state. Police
Officer James Hoffman went to check it out.
Moments after arriving in the area, east of Route 31 at about 8:30
p.m., Hoffman turned into a victim.
His patrol car started taking on water, then started floating away — sliding sideways about 100 yards into deeper water. Hoffman
ditched his bulky duty vest, climbed through a window and started
swimming. He found a tree and held on.
Amazing story.

                    <span>Stanford Medicine:
A large, randomized trial led by researchers at Stanford Medicine
and Yale University has found that wearing a surgical face mask
over the mouth and nose is an effective way to reduce the
occurrence of COVID-19 in community settings.
It also showed that relatively low-cost, targeted interventions to
promote mask-wearing can significantly increase the use of face
coverings in rural, low-income countries. Based on the results,
the interventional model is being scaled up to reach tens of
millions of people in Southeast Asia and Latin America over the
next few months.
You might be tempted to file this under “Duh”, but it’s essential to actually study things like this rigorously. It was just 18 months ago, at the outset of the pandemic, when the CDC and other health organizations were saying people shouldn’t bother with face masks.

                    <span>John Siracusa, on Twitter:
Sure, your “reader” app can include one (1) approved link to your
website … but will you be allowed to have any text near that link
explaining why someone might want to tap on it, or is that still
forbidden? This is where we are, mentally, when considering App
Store rules in 2021.
I have a friend who works at a company with a somewhat popular “reader” app that everyone has heard of, who says that internally, there’s a contingent that suspects Apple is going to require these apps to also offer Apple’s IAP to be allowed to include a link to their website.
That’s how much trust Apple has burned.
The spirit of Apple’s settlement with the Japan Fair Trade Commission is clear: these “reader” apps are going to be permitted to link users to their websites for signing up and buying media like e-books, movies, and music. Within that spirit, of course they’re going to be allowed to have text explaining this, and of course they’re not going to be required to also offer Apple’s IAP for these same purchases.
But very reasonable, smart people are genuinely skeptical that Apple is going to adhere to the spirit of this settlement.
Call me a fool, but I think Apple is going to follow through and do the right thing by these apps. There are a lot of negative adjectives that I’d apply to Apple regarding the App Store. Greedy, inconsistent, frustrating, shortsighted, capricious, technically illiterate. Did I say greedy? But one thing Apple is not and never has been is devious. Apple does not play tricks. And the JFTC would not take kindly to tricks.

In which, this time, the Flyers sign the contract *during* the show. 
 As the gang reviews the Sean Couturier contract after a week to let it settle in, the Flyers gave an extension to Joel Farabee and gave the show a whole new focus. Once that was out of the way the gang dove into the Flyers’ announcement that they’d be adding someone to the team’s Hall of Fame. Picks were made.</span>

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *In what was kind of a surprising bit of news on a late Thursday morning, the Flyers announced that they signed Joel Farabee to the AMac special, locking him up for his prime years. [BSH]
*Like we said it’s a pretty long term contract, so the Flyers are taking a gamble. Calculated, though. [NBC Sports Philly]
*Speaking of impressive youngster, Elliott Desnoyers out of Halifax had a heck of a camp. [Inquirer]
*Speaking of things we are less-than-impressed by, Travis Konecny had a bad year last year. No two ways about it. He’s going to need to be better to move this team forward. [BSH]
*And finally, put a bow on development camp AND get a great subscription deal by reading Charlie’s full analysis of what was what in the way only Charlie can. [The Athletic]</span>

Joe Blackburn and Justin Truman talk Trace Rifles, Gjallarhorn, and Exotic Catalysts
 A little more than a week after the Destiny Showcase, we know a lot more about The Witch Queen expansion and Year 5 of Destiny 2 than we did before. And in talking to game director Joe Blackburn and general manager Justin Truman last week, we’ve gotten new information on weapon crafting and glaives, raids, Hive Guardians, and the subclass reworks. But to round out our series of interviews, it’s time to talk about the lifeblood of Destiny: weapons. 
We spoke to the developer duo about if unique, Exotic-only weapons will stay Exotic forever, the limitations of Exotic Catalysts, and the return of Gjallarhorn.
Legendary trace rifles could be on the horizon

                    <span>In a recent episode of Apple TV+ series &quot;Ted Lasso,&quot; Jeremy Swift&#x27;s character Higgins briefly poked fun at actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney purchasing Welsh soccer club Wrexham AFC last year.





That led Reynolds and McElhenney to respond on Twitter with a humorous letter teasing legal action unless Apple sent over two large boxes of Ted Lasso biscuits.



Wrexham AFC today confirmed that Apple has followed through, sending 50 boxes of the famous Ted Lasso biscuits to players.




A man of his word, thanks @TedLasso! 
Better late than never, 50 boxes of forgiveness are gratefully accepted 🍪

In the TV series, titular character Ted Lasso won over AFC Richmond owner Rebecca Welton by giving her shortbread biscuits every day, which he baked himself.



The second season of &quot;Ted Lasso&quot; is currently streaming on ‌Apple TV+‌. Six episodes have aired so far, with a new episode coming each Friday.

                    <span>Apple has secured the global rights to &quot;The Fight Before Christmas&quot; documentary, which will premiere on Apple TV+ on Friday, November 26, reports Deadline.





The documentary tells the story of lawyer Jeremy Morris, who is obsessed with Christmas and planned the biggest community Christmas event in America. His Christmas plans hit a snag when the home owner&#x27;s association tells him his planned event violates neighborhood rules.



This leads to a man vs. HOA fight over the festivities, and the dispute snowballs out of control.
Produced by Dorothy Street Pictures, the doc follows the story of a North Idaho neighborhood turned upside down by one man&#x27;s obsession with bringing Christmas cheer to all, through the biggest community Christmas event America has ever seen. Christmas-loving lawyer Jeremy Morris&#x27; plan hits a snag when the home owners&#x27; association informs him that the event violates the rules of the neighborhood. A contentious fight over the festivities erupts and things snowball out of control. As the situation escalates, the film asks the question, who wins when different rights and interests collide? Director Read pieces together the polarized perspectives in this quirky Christmas tale about freedoms, with a message about differences and tolerance at its heart.
The film is directed by Becky Read, who produced &quot;Three Identical Strangers,&quot; a documentary about triplets who were separated at birth and adopted by different families.

For the 45mm model, the screen will measure in at 1.9 inches diagonally, up from 1.78 inches, and it will have a resolution of 396 x 484, up from 368 x 448, which equates to 16 percent more pixels. 



Bloomberg has not provided similar details for the 41mm model, but it too will see a comparable increase in body size, and both models will have slimmed down display borders.



The larger 45mm Apple Watch will have more space for complications, and Apple has multiple new watch faces in the works to …</span>

                    <span>Apple will not be able to avoid a proposed class action lawsuit covering Siri privacy claims, reports Reuters. The suit in question, which was initially filed in 2019, accuses Apple&#x27;s voice assistant ‌Siri‌ of violating user privacy.





The plaintiffs involved in the case can try to prove that ‌Siri‌ routinely recorded private conversations due to accidental activations, and that Apple disclosed those conversations to third parties such as advertisers, said the judge.



One user in the lawsuit claimed that his private discussions with his doctor about a &quot;brand name surgical treatment&quot; caused him to receive targeted ads for that treatment, while others said that their discussions about Air Jordan sneakers, Pit Viper sunglasses, and Olive Garden resulted in targeted ads.

                    <span>The iPad mini has been largely the same since it was first introduced in 2012. It&#x27;s had the same thick bezels and Home button across all five of its refreshes, but that&#x27;s set to change with the debut of the ‌iPad mini‌ 6.





Design


The ‌iPad mini‌ 6 will nix the Home button and adopt a design that&#x27;s similar to the iPad Air with a larger edge-to-edge display with slimmed down bezels that measures in at somewhere around 8.3 to 9 inches.



With no Home button, the ‌iPad mini‌ 6 is expected to get the same Touch ID power button as the ‌iPad Air‌, but it&#x27;s not yet clear whether it will get a USB-C port or continue to use Lightning. It could also include a Smart Connector for use with accessories like the Magic Keyboard.

Season two of &quot;Dickinson&quot; premiered earlier this year, and season three is set to premiere on Friday, November 5. In the third season, Emily Dickinson (played by Hailee Steinfeld) sees her productivity fall amid the American Civil War and a battle that divides her own family. She tries to heal the divide around her, wondering if art can keep hope alive and if the future can be better than the past.



&quot;Dickinson&quot; stars Toby Huss, Adrian Blake Enscoe, Anna Baryshnikov, Ella Hunt, Amanda Warren, Chinaza Uche, and Jane Krakowski will return, as will Wiz Khalifa, who plays Death. Guest stars will include Billy Eichner, Chloe Fineman, Zosia Mamet, Will Pullen, and more.

                    <span>A normal-looking Lightning cable that can used to steal data like passwords and send it to a hacker has been developed, Vice reports.



The &quot;OMG Cable&quot; compared to Apple&#x27;s Lightning to USB cable.


The &quot;OMG Cable&quot; works exactly like a normal Lightning to USB cable and can log keystrokes from connected Mac keyboards, iPads, and iPhones, and then send this data to a bad actor who could be over a mile away. They work by creating a Wi-Fi hotspot that a hacker can connect to, and using a simple web app they can record keystrokes.



The cables also include geofencing features that allow users to trigger or block the device&#x27;s payloads based on its location, preventing the leakage of payloads or keystrokes from other devices being collected. Other features include the ability to change keyboard mappings and the ability to forge the identity of USB devices.








The cables contain a small implanted chip and are physically the same size as authentic cables, making it extremely difficult to identify a malicious cable. The implant itself apparently takes up around half of the length of a USB-C connector&#x27;s plastic shell, allowing the cable to continue to operate as normal.



An x-ray view of the implanted chip inside the USB-C end of an OMG Cable.




The cables, made as part of a series of penetration testing tools by the security researcher known as &quot;MG,&quot; have now entered mass production to be sold by the cybersecurity vendor Hak5. The cables are available in a number of versions, including Lightning to USB-C, and can visually mimic cables from a range of accessory manufacturers, making them a noteworthy threat to device security.

According to a paywalled preview of a DigiTimes report, suppliers are scheduled to ramp up Apple Watch Series 7 production starting at the end of September. That timeframe could indeed reflect a short delay in production, as Nikkei Asia had reported that Apple Watch Series 7 mass production was originally slated to begin around mid-September.



It&#x27;s unclear if any production delay would affect launch timing of the Apple Watch Series 7. Apple has unveiled new Apple Watch models in September for five consecutive years, dating back to the Apple Watch Ser…</span>

                    <span>A long-time alternative to Apple&#x27;s Files app has been Documents, developed by Readdle. Today, the company is launching &quot;Documents X,&quot; intending to speed up everyday productivity tasks and offer users a refreshed design.





At the heart of Documents X is a feature Readdle is calling &quot;Smart Actions.&quot; Smart Actions are contextual actions that are recommended to users depending on an action they just took. For example, if a user uploads a file to Dropbox or Google Drive, the app may suggest that the user shares the link. If a user downloads a music video, they may get presented with a Smart Action to extract the audio from the video.





The number of Smart Actions is rather extensive and is built directly into the app without launching external apps or services to perform them. Readdle says all the actions are &quot;performed locally, which means that your files and activities don’t leave the device.&quot;





Documents X is also built on an updated design philosophy Readdle is calling &quot;FOCUS.&quot; FOCUS aims to reduce complexity for the in-app experience while maintaining a high level of attention to detail and simplicity. The new design includes updated colors, icons, menus, controls, and more that have been &quot;thoughtfully designed.&quot; 



Documents X can be downloaded from the App Store for free [Direct Link].

                    <span>Each Twitter Super Follow subscription is an individual in-app purchase for every account with the feature set up, it has emerged.



Screenshot from Jane Manchun Wong showing Twitter&#x27;s in-app purchases on its App Store page.


The unusual system, spotted by Jane Manchun Wong, means that for every Super Follow there is an individual in-app purchase for that account specifically. Some observers are speculating that each Super Follow in-app purchase will have to be set up manually by Twitter on the ‌App Store‌, making the system even more unconventional.



The ‌App Store‌ does not allow for multiple instances of the same subscription, leading other platforms such as YouTube and Twitch to get around this by effectively allowing users to buy a sub-token that can be directed toward a specific creator.



This means that there will be thousands of Twitter in-app purchases, dwarfing Twitter&#x27;s own Twitter Blue subscription and Ticketed Spaces, Twitter&#x27;s ‌App Store‌ page will only show 10 in-app purchases since it would be impractical to show the entire list.



Apple only allows developers to create up to 10,000 in-app purchases, so it is not clear if Twitter will limit the users eligible to sell Super Follows at 10,000 minus Ticketed Spaces and Twitter Blue.



Twitter announced Super Follows earlier this year, allowing creators with at least 10,000 Followers to charge up to $9.99 per month as a subscription for access to exclusive tweets. Twitter takes a three percent cut of Super Follow subscriptions up to a total of $50,000, making Apple&#x27;s 30 percent in-app purchase fee markedly larger.



The feature finally launched yesterday, starting in the United States and Canada, but it will be rolling out globally on iOS in the next few weeks.

                    <span>Apple is rumored to be in Asia visiting Toyota as it prepares to lay the supplier groundwork to mass produce a branded car by 2024, according to a new report by DigiTimes.





Apple representatives were said to have met with South Korea&#x27;s SK Group and LG Electronics last month to discuss Apple Car development, and now Japan&#x27;s Toyota is being touted as its next potential destination. 



Apple has been working on a car-related project since at least 2014, and at one stage it looked as if the company was scaling back to focus on autonomous vehicle software. However, following several changes in management and hiring, Apple is now believed to be focused on building a car for consumers.



But to do that, the company needs to tap into a whole new supply chain. Apple is expected to rely on a manufacturing partner to build the vehicles, and though it wants to make EV batteries in the United States, it may be seeking partnerships with established vehicle makers like Toyota to do so.



Reuters has previously reported that Apple is developing a new battery design that has the potential to &quot;radically&quot; reduce the cost of batteries and increase the vehicle&#x27;s range.



One person who spoke to Reuters described Apple&#x27;s &quot;monocle&quot; battery technology as &quot;next level&quot; and said that it&#x27;s similar to &quot;the first time you saw the iPhone.&quot;



Reuters&#x27; reporting claimed that Apple is aiming to begin production on an Apple-branded self-driving vehicle starting in 2024, so DigiTimes&#x27; focus on that date isn&#x27;t necessarily a shot in the dark. However, delays caused by the ongoing global health crisis or current chip shortage could always push production to 2025 or beyond.

                    <span>Eve today released an update to its latest version of the Eve Thermo that adds Thread support to the HomeKit-enabled smart radiator valve (via HomeKitNews).





The update fulfills a pledge the German company made late last year to bring Thread support to several products, and follows its inclusion in devices like the Eve Energy Smart plug (fourth generation), Eve Aqua (second generation), Eve Weather, and Eve Door &amp; Window (third generation).



As a quick explainer, Thread is a low latency and low power mesh-like network for smart devices. Unlike Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, the Thread standard doesn&#x27;t depend on a router or hub. Instead, the smart device itself extends the network by talking to other Thread-enabled devices, thereby boosting the signal between them.



Apple&#x27;s HomePod mini and the latest Apple TV 4K act as Thread border routers, and by adding Thread-supported devices around the home, users can typically expect improved connectivity compared to Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, a wider control range, and more remote scheduling options.



In related news, version 5.3 of the Eve app adds support for its upcoming HomeKit-enabled MothionBlinds, which are expected to launch sometime this year.

                    <span>Apple hopes to circumvent Samsung in the supply of components for a &quot;folded&quot; telephoto lens for 2023 iPhones, according to unnamed sources cited by Korean website The Elec.





The report claims Apple has approached Jahwa Electronics, which is part of Samsung&#x27;s supply chain, to supply an optical image stabilization module for the camera. Jahwa co-developed the technology with Samsung, which could cause Apple patent problems down the line. However, Apple likely has its own workaround for the patents or will end up paying a licensing fee to Samsung, according to the report. 



The Elec links these latest developments to iPhone models for release in 2023, but the outlet has previously claimed that Apple may use components made by Samsung for a &quot;folded&quot; telephoto lens on at least s…</span>

                    <span>Apple could be facing a widespread investigation into the App Store in India, and more specifically, the company&#x27;s in-app purchasing system, which grants it a 15% to 30% commission for all purchases made, reports Reuters.





The Competition Commission of India (CCI), which oversees cases of possible anti-competitive and antitrust behavior, is reviewing an antitrust challenge case against Apple presented by a non-profit Indian group. The group claims, in their case, that Apple&#x27;s standard 30% commission for in-app purchases &quot;hurts competition&quot; since it raises costs for both the developer and the customer. 

&quot;The existence of the 30% commission means that some app developers will never make it to the market ... This could also result in consumer harm,&quot; said the filing, which has bee…</span>

                    <span>Spotify has announced a new partnership with Delta that will see the streaming service take over the &quot;audio&quot; section of Delta&#x27;s in-flight seatback entertainment, making select playlists and podcasts freely available to all passengers.




You are now free to roam about the cabin—and get the music and podcasts you love at 30,000 feet. Beginning today, we&#x27;re taking off in a new partnership with Delta in which Spotify will take over the &quot;audio&quot; section of Delta&#x27;s in-flight seatback entertainment. This means passengers on Delta flights that are equipped with seatback entertainment globally can now enjoy their favorite audio content exclusively in-flight on Delta Studio. 
According to the press release, the free in-flight content is licensed directly by Delta and will include specially curated versions of Spotify&#x27;s most popular playlists, along with 42 select podcast series to choose from. 



In other words, not all Spotify content will be available, but passengers will be able to listen to playlists such as such as Mood Booster, Are &amp; Be, Hot Country, mint, Today&#x27;s Top Hits, Relax &amp; Unwind, RapCaviar, and Ultimate Indie. 



The first podcasts available will include Crime Junkie, Science Vs, StartUp, The Dave Chang Show, The Hottest Take, The Journal, and more.



Spotify says the update to Delta&#x27;s in-flight entertainment is rolling out now, with more content being updated regularly and more coming in October.

                    <span>Apple today announced that the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) has agreed to close its App Store investigation in exchange for changes to how &quot;reader&quot; apps like Netflix operate. Reader apps allow users to browse previously purchased content or content subscriptions for digital magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, and video.





Going forward, developers that create &quot;reader&quot; apps will be able to include an in-app link to their website for users to either set up or manage an account, and signup using a non-App Store payment method will be possible. Apple says that this change will be applied globally to all reader apps on the ‌App Store‌.

                    <span>This is actually big news from Apple:
Apple today announced an update coming to the App Store that
closes an investigation by the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC).
The update will allow developers of “reader” apps to include an
in-app link to their website for users to set up or manage an
account. While the agreement was made with the JFTC, Apple will
apply this change globally to all reader apps on the store. Reader
apps provide previously purchased content or content subscriptions
for digital magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, and video.
To ensure a safe and seamless user experience, the App Store’s
guidelines require developers to sell digital services and
subscriptions using Apple’s in-app payment system. Because
developers of reader apps do not offer in-app digital goods and
services for purchase, Apple agreed with the JFTC to let
developers of these apps share a single link to their website to
help users set up and manage their account. […]
“Trust on the App Store is everything to us. The focus of the App
Store is always to create a safe and secure experience for users,
while helping them find and use great apps on the devices they
love,” said Phil Schiller, Apple Fellow who oversees the App
Store. “We have great respect for the Japan Fair Trade Commission
and appreciate the work we’ve done together, which will help
developers of reader apps make it easier for users to set up and
manage their apps and services, while protecting their privacy and
maintaining their trust.”
Progress. Apple’s anti-steering provisions are the number one thing I have been clamoring to be changed in the App Store rules. I think this should expand beyond just “reader” apps, but one step at a time.
Do you hear that sound? That’s the sound of a significant amount of antitrust pressure being relieved from Apple.

                    <span>I released Acorn 7.1 yesterday, which has some new features, changes, and bug fixes. There&#x27;s nothing earth shattering in here, just another release that continually improves Acorn. The full release notes are available as always.
There is one little, yet devilish, bug fix in the 7.1 release. It took a while to track down and the fix of course was super easy.
Soon after the release of MacOS 11.5 I started getting crash reports. Lots of crash reports. They all had similar stack traces, pointing to something in the guts of Apple&#x27;s Key Value Observing code (_NSKeyValueObservationInfoGetObservances specifically).

                    <span>Allen Pike: The Persistent Gravity of Cross Platform
In practice, the tradeoff is about more than “cheap vs. good”. Unintuitively, sometimes native tech can actually be the cheapest way to achieve a certain goal, and sometimes cross-platform technologies actually lead to better products, even for very well-funded companies. So what is a useful way to think about the tradeoff?
Over the last decade I’ve talked to people at hundreds of companies about how they’re developing and supporting apps, helping them evaluate and plan native and cross-platform app work. While there are a lot of factors that go into this technology decision, there’s one that I think is particularly illuminating.
More and more apps written with web tech (such as Electron) are showing up on the Mac desktop everyday. I understand why, but I don&#x27;t have to like it.</span>

The young winger has one year left on his ELC.
 The Philadelphia Flyers just won’t stop making moves. I think Chuck Fletcher just likes being in the spotlight.
Announced by the team on Thursday, they have signed one of their most premium young players in Joel Farabee to a six-year, $30-million ($5-million AAV) extension. The 21-year-old still has one year remaining on his rookie contract, making this deal keep him in Philadelphia through the 2027-28 season.

But, he improved in other areas of his game.
 If one was expecting Travis Konecny to carry the momentum from the start of his 2020-21 season throughout the year, then you were sadly let down.
We can be forgiven for the optimism given Konecny’s habit to hit the ground running in NHL seasons, and with expectations on the Flyers high last year, it was appearing as if we could have a point-per-game TK on our hands. 


However, Konecny’s 2020-21 was streaky, and after his promising start, he went through large stretches of games with zero points. At times he disappeared and was barely noticeable on the ice, from a personal eye-test perspective.




Despite his streakiness, and penchant to go missing from games, 34 points in 50 games doesn’t c…</span>

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *That’s another Development Camp in the books, and now all we have to do is wait a couple of weeks for the big boys to hit the ice. The big finale was the 3-on-3 tournament, in which a couple of guys you expected to look good looked good. Which is good! [Flyers]
*The star of the show on day three was definitely front office newcomer Mike O’Connell, who has some really insightful things to say about the players he worked with. [BSH]
*Isaac Ratcliffe got the last word on the player blog’s front. Kid’s working hard. [Flyers]
*Ratcliffe has been a bit of a letdown since joining the Phantoms, but he’s hoping all that aforementioned hard work is going to get him back to the performance level we all expected when he was drafted. [Inquirer]
*The big winger owes a lot to the Flyers organization. Like, A LOT. And as a result, he really wants to succeed here. [NBC Sports Philly]
*With camp behind us and focus turning to the big boys, let’s talk about some young guys poised for a breakout this season. [BSH]
*Wednesday night Team Canada finally beat the US women at Worlds in an overtime thriller. Here’s how they finally did it. [The Athletic]
*And finally, it’s 25 Under 25 time! We’re going to roll through the 25 best players as quickly as we can before training camp starts, and we need you to tell us who those best 25 are. So get to voting. [BSH]</span>

Turn-based tactical gameplay for months
 A collection of Final Fantasy games are on the way to PlayStation Now, which allow players to stream the titles on their PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, or PC. The first game will be Final Fantasy 7 — the original version, which is still worth a spin, not the recent remake. Final Fantasy 7 will arrive on PlayStation Now on Sept. 7, and it’ll be followed by one new Final Fantasy game a month until some of the series’ best games are available to play.
The second game will be Final Fantasy 8 Remastered on Oct. 5, which is a turn-based tale of sweeping romance and worldwide war. Squall, Rinoa, and the rest of the SeeD gang are part of one of the most underrated Final Fantasies, and it’s nice to see more players having access to that tale. 
This is followed by Final Fantasy 9 on Nov. 2, which is still fondly remembered thanks to characters like Vivi, Garnet, and Zidane. In December, players get a two-fer with Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2 HD Remaster. Finally, on Jan. 4, 2022, Final Fantasy 12: The Zodiac Age will release on PlayStation Now, which is great because it has Balthier and Fran, who are some of the best party members in the entire franchise.</span>

Destiny 2 will also see a remaster of another original Destiny raid
 In addition to revealing that Destiny 2 players will get a new raid or dungeon every three months starting this December, Bungie recently announced that the legacy raid rotation will return. During its Destiny Showcase last week, the studio talked about the importance of that aspirational, pinnacle content for players. Convincing Destiny’s hardcore players to get together each week is a major priority, according to game director Joe Blackburn and general manager Justin Truman. Those incentives will take the form of the legacy raid rotation and yet another remastered raid from the original Destiny.

Meet Vex, the cutest lil goth
 League of Legends has tons of cute champions, including the fuzzy fae race known as Yordles. The next champion is Vex, the Gloomist, and she turns that trend on its head. This is one sad, emo little Yordle, and she’s got a big shadow friend to help her control the battlefield. Vex looks like a powerful mage who’s able to set up her abilities from range.
Riot hasn’t revealed the exact explanation and numbers behind her ability kit, but we see her use her shadow for getting around the map a little faster and setting up an initiation as the enemy team goes to kill the dragon.


We knew Vex was on the way, thanks to her presence in the Sentinels of Light lore event. Vex helped out the Ruined King, Viego, and it looks like she still has a little bit of a crush on the gloomy wife guy. She also wants to hang out with Amumu, the sad mummy with no friends, so she’s not all bad. Her debut skin also looks much more colorful, for players who find the dark color palette to be unappealing.</span>

I can have a little cosmic dread, as a treat
 A recent Dead Space panel came with a revelation: protagonist Isaac Clarke, who was speechless in the original game, would now be voice acted for the remake. It’s a relatively small change in the grand scheme of things, but it’s a point of contention for many fans. A voice protagonist is a tricky tool to use in horror, and some games use a little too much of it. 



Sometimes it works out OK, like Leon S. Kennedy in Resident Evil 4, who is fondly remembered for his great zingers like “Your right hand comes off?” But in The Medium, a recent horror title from Bloober Team, I could hardly hear myself think over protagonist Marianne’s musings. She kept leading me places while processing it aloud in real time, like someo…</span>

                    <span>Two of Apple&#x27;s self-driving cars operating in manual mode were involved in minor collisions in August, according to the California DMV.





The first incident [PDF] occurred in San Diego, California in the Hillcrest area on August 19. The Lexus RX 450h was stopped in traffic and was hit by a Hyundai. The accident was described as minor with no injuries.



The second accident [PDF] occurred on August 23 in Cupertino, California, right near the Apple Park campus. The vehicle with Apple&#x27;s self-driving equipment was in manual mode and it was stopped in traffic when it was rear ended by a Subaru Outback.



Both of these incidents were not the fault of the self-driving vehicle or the person operating the vehicle, and are largely not notable. What is interesting, though, is that Apple vehicles were involved in two collisions in the same month after no accidents since September 2019.



Earlier this year, the California DMV&#x27;s disengagement and mileage reports suggested that Apple&#x27;s Lexus SUVs with self-driving software traversed more than 18,000 miles in 2020, a steep increase compared to prior years. It&#x27;s possible that Apple has ramped up its testing in 2021, leading to a higher number of incidents.



Apple has been testing its self-driving software since early 2017, using the aforementioned Lexus RX 450h vehicles outfitted with sensors and cameras. The work on autonomous driving is part of Apple&#x27;s longtime car project, and rumors suggest Apple is planning to release a vehicle in the mid to late 2020s.

                    <span>Twitter today announced the official launch of Super Follows, a new feature that allows creators to provide subscriber-only content that requires a paid fee to access.





First introduced in February, Super Follow is another method that Twitter is using to monetize tweets and provide content creators with a way to earn money on the platform.



Creators who use the Super Follow feature on Twitter can charge $2.99, $4.99, or $9.99 per month to allow their subscribers to access exclusive tweet content. According to Twitter, creators are eligible to keep up to 97 percent of revenue until a $50,000 threshold is reached, and after that, creators will earn up to 80 percent of revenue after in-app purchase fees.



Twitter says that Super Follows are designed for anyone that brings &quot;unique perspectives and personalities&quot; to Twitter to drive public conversation.



At the current time, Super Follows are available to a small group of U.S. content creators that applied to participate, but people can apply to join the waitlist to set up a Super Follows subscription. 10,000 or more Twitter follows are required.



Those interested in subscribing to an account that offers Super Follows can tap on the Super Follow button on an account&#x27;s profile to see pricing details. Super Follow is limited to the U.S. and Canada at the current time, but it will be rolling out globally on iOS in the next few weeks.

                    <span>Apple today released a new update for Safari Technology Preview, the experimental browser Apple first introduced in March 2016. Apple designed the ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ to test features that may be introduced into future release versions of Safari.





‌Safari Technology Preview‌ release 131 includes bug fixes and performance improvements for Web Inspector, CSS, Web API, JavaScript, Platform Features, Media, Web Audio, WebRTC, Payment Request, WebCrypto, Accessibility, and Rendering. Apple warns that Tab Groups do not sync in this release.

Employees have been asked to voluntarily share whether they have been vaccinated by mid-September, and this applies to both employees working in an office and those working remotely.

                    <span>Twitter today announced that it is testing a new feature called Safety Mode, which is designed to cut down on harassment and unwelcome interactions on the social network.





Users who often get unwanted, spammy, or abusive replies to their tweets can turn on Safety Mode, which will autoblock accounts that use harmful language like insults, or send repetitive, uninvited replies and mentions.



Twitter says that Safety Mode assesses the likelihood of a negative engagement by considering the Tweet&#x27;s content and the relationship between the Tweet author and replier. People blocked by Safety Mode will be unable to follow your account, see your Tweets, or send Direct Messages.




Introducing Safety Mode. A new way to limit unwelcome interactions on Twitter. pic.twitter.com/xa5Ot2TVhF
— Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) September 1, 2021
 


With Safety Mode, the autoblock stays on for a minimum of seven days, and autoblocked accounts are listed in the Safety Mode interface. Accounts that a person follows will not be autoblocked.



To develop Safety Mode, Twitter consulted trusted partners with expertise in online safety, mental health, and human rights.
We want you to enjoy healthy conversations, so this test is one way we&#x27;re limiting overwhelming and unwelcome interactions that can interrupt those conversations. Our goal is to better protect the individual on the receiving end of Tweets by reducing the prevalence and visibility of harmful remarks.
Twitter is testing Safety Mode with a small group of people at the current time and will expand the testing group as feedback is received. During the beta testing period, Twitter says it will incorporate improvements and adjustments before releasing the feature for all users.

                    <span>After unveiling its latest Pixel 6 smartphones with a custom Arm-based Google Tensor chip last month, Google is also developing its own Arm-based processors for future Chromebook laptops and tablets, according to Nikkei Asia. 





Google plans to roll out its own processors for Chromebooks in around 2023, according to the report. Chromebooks are laptops, tablets, and detachable devices that run Google&#x27;s Chrome OS operating system, and they are available from brands such as Google, Samsung, Lenovo, Dell, HP, Acer, and ASUS in several markets.



The report claims that Google was particularly inspired by Apple&#x27;s success in developing its own chips for not only iPhones, but also Macs following the introduction of the Apple-designed M1 chip last year. The first Macs with Apple silicon chips were released in November 2020 and Apple previously said the transition away from Intel-based processors for its Mac lineup would take about two years to be completed.



The latest Mac to transition to Apple silicon is the base model iMac, which was updated with the M1 chip, a colorful new design, and a larger 24-inch display in April. Apple is also rumored to be planning redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with a faster version of the M1 chip for release later this year, with multiple reports having stated the notebooks are likely to be released in October or November.

Version 8 of the popular messaging platform uncaps the previous live stream audience limit of 1,000 viewers for groups and channels, and includes more customization options when forwarding messages, plus a shortcut to switch between channels.



The change makes the previous update that brought group video calls all the more powerful for live broadcasts. &quot;The power to run your own TV station is here, right in your pocket,&quot; says Telegram in a blog post, underlining the possibilities.



When forwarding messages, there&#x27;s a new option to remove captions, and sender names can now be hidden. Meanwhile, at the bottom of a text channel, there&#x27;s a new option to quickly swipe up and jump to the next unread channel.



This update also makes stickers easier to find, with trending stickers now shown above the &quot;Recently Used&quot; sticker panel, and there&#x27;s now an unread messages counter in comment threads.



Telegram is a free download for iPhone and iPad from the App Store. [Direct Link]

                    <span>Apple has returned to in-person Today at Apple sessions in its retail stores in Europe, including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Turkey, and Brussels, offering local communities a chance to gather once again to learn, collaborate, and explore the world of Apple&#x27;s devices and services.





Apple, due to the global health crisis, halted in-person Today at Apple sessions last year. The company was originally hoping to return to normalcy in its stores in the United States on August 30; however, concerns regarding the health and safety of staff and customers pushed the company to delay the return to in-person Today at Apple sessions. 



In replacement of in-person sessions, Apple has been producing and publishing Today at Apple sessions for YouTube, ranging from photography to drawing and art. Apple customers in Europe can now reserve and participate in Today at Apple sessions by checking the website for date, time, and availability for their local store. 



Apple says that it will ask all participants, including kids, to wear a mask, adhere to social distancing, and additional health and safety measures based on local conditions.

                    <span>On Tuesday, Nikkei Asia published a report claiming the upcoming Apple Watch Series 7 will feature blood pressure measurement capabilities, and that this is one of the reasons why production of the device has hit snags as manufacturers adjust to the more complex design. 





Later the same day, Bloomberg cited its own sources corroborating Nikkei&#x27;s main claim that the new model had brought manufacturing challenges which could lead to supply constraints or shipment delays, but the subsequent report by Debbie Wu and Mark Gurman made no mention of Nikkei&#x27;s claim about a blood pressure sensor being one of the causes of the production snags.



However, if there was any doubt, Gurman has now put to bed Nikkei&#x27;s key assertion in a tweet, saying that there&#x27;s &quot;no chance&quot; the Apple Watch…</span>

                    <span>Google is rumored to be working on a new wireless charging stand that could deliver 23W of charging power to its upcoming Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro phones, according to a leaked inventory image published by Android Police.

If true, that would beat the iPhone 12&#x27;s maximum 15W wireless charging speed (or 12W on ‌iPhone 12 mini‌) using Apple&#x27;s MagSafe charger, and would be another one-up for the Pixel 6 phones, which are already shaping up to be a respectable rival to the upcoming iPhone 13 expected to launch this month. 



With a ‌‌MagSafe‌‌ charger and Apple&#x27;s 20W power adapter or another appropriate 20W+ PD 3.0 charger, it takes about an hour to charge an ‌‌iPhone 12‌‌ from zero to 50 percent, which is double the time that it takes to charge using a…</span>

                    <span>Starting today, the popular Philips Hue smart lights will feature a deep integration with the Spotify streaming music service, allowing Hue users to sync their lights to their Spotify playlists.





The Philips Hue system will use an algorithm to analyze the metadata of each song in real time to make Hue lights flash, dim, brighten, and change colors while matching with the beat, mood, genre, and tempo of music on Spotify. The algorithm even takes into account factors like loudness, segments, pitch, and more.



With the Sync tab in the Philips Hue app, users can personalize the Spotify integration experience. There are tools for starting and stopping the sync, changing the brightness and intensity of the lights, and choosing a palette to change the colors of the lights.

                    <span>James Wan‘s heralded return to horror, Malignant, releases on September 10, in theaters and HBO Max, but much of it remains shrouded in mystery.

The new rules will only allow gaming platforms to offer services

Folks ... it is back.
 The last time we did an update to our periodical, often-twice-a-year-but-sometimes-less Philadelphia Flyers Top 25 Under 25 series here at BSH, it was in March of 2020, when the NHL had just hit pause on its regular season due to COVID and we thought hockey was going to be back pretty soon and things would be normal before we knew it. And that’s exactly what happened!
(/does the thing where you put your finger to your ear to pretend you’re getting an important update on an earpiece)
Ah. I’m hearing that that’s not actually what happened. I hate it here.
Anywho! It’s been so long since we last did this that the Flyers have brought on not one, but two draft classes since then. Nine of the players in the Top 25 the l…</span>

Another development camp check-in. 
 We’re still rolling through development camp, and the yesterday saw the players pretty much wrapping up the drills focused portion of camp, before we move into the 3-on-3 tournament this afternoon. After the day’s sessions, we caught up with one of the organization’s newcomers in Mike O’Connell (Senior Advisor to the General Manager/Player Development), as well as a couple of players in Samuel Ersson, Isaac Ratcliffe, and Mason Millman. They were a chatty bunch, so we’ll avoid going on for a million years here and just run through the highlight reel.

On Isaac Ratcliffe, and if anyone in particular has surprised him at camp. 
Well, I’ll get to Isaac first. He’s big guy, for sure. Again, I’m just getting to know…</span>

The youth movement has been somewhat halted — but there’s still plenty of breakout potential in this group of youngsters. 
 After scoring just eight goals in 52 games during his rookie season, Joel Farabee exploded with a 20-goal, 38-point campaign in 2020-21 — which begs the question of which Flyer is poised to backup Farabee’s breakout with one of their own in 2021-22.
Given that Flyers GM Chuck Fletcher was aggressive in moving out younger players that traditionally fall into the breakout mold ala Farabee in favor of better veterans to improve the team in the short-term, there are significantly less options to choose from during this exercise.
That said, the Flyers still have some intriguing young talent in the pipeline that are certainly ski…</span>

 Marvel’s Midnight Suns is the next turn-based game from the team behind XCOM. Lead designer Jake Solomon was on hand today during a Twitch livestream hosted by IGN to detail the game’s card-based combat system.
The combat was the biggest reveal from the stream, which included a six-minute sequence of heavily edited gameplay. It showed a hand of cards positioned along the bottom of the user interface, right about where XCOM’s ability hotkeys lived in the past. The video went on to detail how those abilities are gained, upgraded, and combined with other heroes’ moves.

Hive Guardians are powerful new enemies in Destiny 2, and they’ll take some new strategies to kill
 For all of Bungie’s impressive tricks shown in the reveal of Destiny 2: The Witch Queen, the addition of Hive Guardians is likely the biggest. While monumental from a story perspective, Hive Guardians will also shape each fight in which they’re present. Like the Guardians that players control, Hive Guardians can use Supers, and they can resurrect — they can fight like us.
In an interview with Destiny 2 game director Joe Blackburn and general manager Justin Truman, we spoke about the challenges that Hive Guardians bring to the field.

Attack and defense are a little different on Fracture
 Valorant’s new map is its most unique so far. Fracture, which was officially announced on Wednesday, reverses attackers and defenders and makes both sides play a little differently than they’re used to. 
Fracture is shaped like a giant letter “H.” There are two bombsites on the map with the connecting section of the “H” in-between. While you might expect the middle section to be the attacker’s spawn, it’s actually the other way around. On Fracture, defenders start in the middle, leaving the spawn area to defend the sites on either side. Meanwhile, the attackers can pinch in toward the defenders from either side. To help make transitioning from one area of the map to another a little easier, there are also ziplines that run from one side to the other that run below the map.
Image: Riot Games
  
This represents a pretty massive change to the regular format for Valorant maps, which generally place defenders in positions that encourage more passive play, allowing attackers to push into them. However, on this map, the spawns mean that defenders are often put in the position to make the first move. 


Fracture also includes more lore than any previous Valorant map. The map features two mirror versions of reality, which is essentially the set up for the game’s larger story — and its explanation for why two versions of the same Agent might face off in a match. While we don’t know much about the world beyond its mirrored concept, there are interactable clues spread out around Fracture that should shed some new light on Valorant’s two realities. 
Image: Riot Games
  
Fracture is set to come to Valorant as part of the patch 3.05 update, which players should expect to arrive next week as part of the game’s new Act update. Valorant Episode 3 Act 2 is scheduled to drop around Sept. 9.

It’s a placeholder file, and mainly an Xbox Game Pass promotion
 If you’re an Xbox Game Pass subscriber, it looks like you can preinstall* Halo Infinite, a game launching a good three months from now.
(*You’ll be preinstalling what appears to be a 280.2 MB placeholder file, not a full build ready to play in the first minute of launch day or anything.)
Nonetheless, Halo fans and Xbox Game Pass subscribers took Microsoft up on the offer this morning, which right now isn’t much more than a preorder call to action. Halo Infinite launches Dec. 8 on Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X, and the preload offer verifies that it’ll be available the same day for Game Pass members, the same as Microsoft-published Forza Horizon 5, which also has a preloading option. The racing game launches Nov. 9.
Originally expected with the arrival of the Xbox Series X last year, Halo Infinite’s launch date was finally revealed a week ago at Gamescom. The game will arrive with a free-to-play multiplayer mode and a single-player campaign, but cooperative campaign multiplayer will have to wait for a post-release update. 
343 Industries’ Gamescom presentation made no mention of Halo Infinite’s campaign, which some fans found worrying. Infinite’s creative director followed up with a post the next day saying that the campaign is finished and feature complete, and that the developers are just busy finding and wiping out bugs and getting the game ready for release.</span>

Microsoft announces its first Xbox and PC games of September
 Xbox Game Pass subscribers will get a new slate of games in the first half of September, starting with Final Fantasy 13, the post-apocalyptic roguelike Nuclear Throne, and the absolutely ridiculous Surgeon Simulator 2. 
Along with those three, Microsoft is adding Craftopia, Breathedge, Signs of the Sojourner, Crown Trick, and The Artful Escape. Each of these games is coming to both console and PC, making this a packed couple of weeks for all of the service’s subscribers. 
Here’s what Xbox Game Pass subscribers should expect in the next few weeks: 
Craftopia (Cloud, Console, and PC) — Sept. 2
Final Fantasy 13 (Console and PC) — Sept. 2
Signs of the Sojourner (Cloud, Console, and PC) — Sept. 2
Surgeon Simulator 2 (Cloud, Console, and PC) — Sept. 2
Crown Trick (Console and PC) — Sept. 7
Breathedge (Cloud, Console, and PC) — Sept. 9
Nuclear Throne (Console and PC) — Sept. 9
The Artful Escape (Console and PC) — Sept. 9
On top of that, there are also three Quake titles, Quake, Quake 2, and Quake 3 Arena, which came to the service in late August. August also saw the additions of Myst, Twelve Minutes, Hades, Skate 3, and several other games to Xbox Game Pass, which are still available. 
Of course, there are also a few games leaving the service in September:

Red Dead Online (Cloud and Console)

Company of Heroes 2 (PC)
Disgaea 4 (PC)

Settlements and more arrive in 3.6 patch for No Man’s Sky
 Developer Hello Games gives No Man’s Sky players another free update with Frontiers, which introduces planetary settlements to the massive procedurally generated space exploration game. Hello Games likens the new settlements to the spaceport city of Mos Eisley from Star Wars, where intergalactic travelers can gather and grow their community.
No Man’s Sky’s new settlements, available Wednesday in patch 3.6, are tiny towns with NPC inhabitants, some of whom have their own problems. Players can help these settlements grow and even oversee them; Overseers can construct new buildings, solve citizens’ problems, make decisions, resolve disagreements, and provide security against threats.

                    <span>Apple today seeded a new public beta of the macOS 12 Monterey beta to public beta testers, allowing non-developers to test the new macOS Monterey software ahead of its public release. The updated beta comes just a day after Apple released the sixth macOS Monterey developer beta.





Public beta testers can download the macOS 12 Monterey update from the Software Update section of the System Preferences app after installing the proper profile from Apple&#x27;s beta software website.



‌macOS Monterey‌ introduces quite a few major updates for the macOS operating system. Universal Control, for example, lets a single mouse, trackpad, and keyboard be used across multiple Mac or iPad devices, and it&#x27;s now possible to AirPlay directly to a Mac from an iPhone, ‌iPad‌, or even another Mac.

                    <span>Twitter&#x27;s latest beta update introduces support for providing content creators with Bitcoin tips using the &quot;Tip Jar&quot; feature that Twitter introduced earlier this year. Bitcoin isn&#x27;t yet available to select as a tip option for beta users, but code in the beta suggests that Twitter is in the process of rolling it out.





When the Tip Jar was first introduced, Twitter allowed users to add Bandcamp, Cash App, Patreon, PayPal and Venmo links to their Twitter profile, but soon, there will be a Bitcoin option. The addition of a Bitcoin tipping option comes after Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey told investors in July that Bitcoin was important to the company and would be coming to the Tip Jar in the future.



Details in the latest Twitter beta indicate that users will be directed through a Bitcoin tutorial that includes details on the Bitcoin Lightning Network and custodial and non-custodial Bitcoin wallets.



Twitter gives Strike, Blue Wallet and Wallet of Satoshi as examples of custodial wallets and Muun, Breez, Phoenix and Zap as examples of non-custodial wallets. Twitter also informs users that a Strike account is required. &quot;We use Strike to generate Bitcoin Lightning invoices so you&#x27;ll need to connect your account to accept Bitcoin tips&quot; reads the text.



Twitter also appears to be working on &quot;Cheer,&quot; &quot;Haha,&quot; &quot;Hmm,&quot; &quot;Like,&quot; and &quot;Sad&quot; reactions to tweets that users will be able to activate using a press and hold gesture on the current like button.





Bitcoin support for tips is limited to the Twitter beta at this time and is not yet available for all beta users, so it is not yet clear when the Bitcoin feature will see an official release. There&#x27;s also no word just yet on when the new reactions will launch.

                    <span>Apple today released a revised version of the AirTags firmware that was first provided to ‌AirTags‌ owners last week. The new internal build number is 1A291c, up from 1A291a.





We don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s included in the new firmware and no new features were found following the first release, so it likely focuses on bug fixes and other under-the-hood improvements.



There is no way to force an AirTag update, as it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s done over-the-air through a connected iPhone. To make sure the update happens, you can put your AirTag in range of your ‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌, but you have to wait for the firmware to roll out to your device.



You can check your current AirTag firmware version using the Find My app, with instructions available in our how to.

                    <span>The popular endless hopper Crossy Road from Hipster Whale is coming soon to Apple Arcade. A release date has not been announced at this time, but users can sign up to be notified when the game becomes available through the App Store.





Similar to Frogger, Crossy Road tasks players with crossing a road bustling with traffic and obstacles, and there are many adorable characters to choose from, ranging from a chicken to a penguin. As with all games available through the service, the Apple Arcade version of Crossy Road will not have any ads or in-app purchases available.



Crossy Road was among the first games announced for the fourth-generation Apple TV alongside the introduction of the tvOS App Store back in September 2015. However, it appears the Apple Arcade edition of the game will be limited to the iPhone and iPad.



A variation of the game titled Crossy Road Castle, an endless runner/platformer combo, launched on Apple Arcade in February 2020.



Three additional games are set to launch on Apple Arcade this Friday, including Zen Pinball Party, MasterChef: Let&#x27;s Cook, and Layton&#x27;s Mystery Journey.



Priced at $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year, Apple Arcade provides access to a catalog of over 200 games without ads or in-app purchases across the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV, with additional titles added periodically.

                    <span>Apple today seeded the eighth beta of the upcoming watchOS 8 update to developers for testing purposes, with the update coming one week after Apple released the seventh watchOS 8 beta.





To install ‌‌watchOS 8‌‌, developers will need to download the configuration profile from the Apple Developer Center. Once installed, ‌‌watchOS 8‌‌ can be downloaded through the dedicated Apple Watch app on the iPhone by going to General &gt; Software update.



To update to new software, an Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery life, it must be placed on the charger, and it needs to be in range of the ‌‌iPhone‌‌. It&#x27;s not recommended to install ‌‌watchOS 8‌‌ on a main Apple Watch as the software may be unstable at this early date.

Developers can download the new tvOS 15 beta by downloading a profile onto the ‌Apple TV‌ using Xcode.



Apple shared little about tvOS 15 when it was unveiled, but there are some new features that are coming to the operating system. SharePlay, a FaceTime feature that lets multiple users watch TV shows or movies together, will integrate with tvOS, and there&#x27;s a new &quot;For All of You&quot; recommendation engine that suggests shows everyone might enjoy.



A Shared With You section also displays movies and shows that were shared with you through the Messages app so you remember to check them out. When paired with AirPods Pro or AirPods Max, the ‌Apple TV‌ supports Spatial audio for a theater-like surround sound experience, and there&#x27;s a new feature for automatically connecting your AirPods through Smart ‌AirPods‌ routing.



Hey Siri commands can be used to launch Apple TV+ shows, and two HomePod mini speakers can be paired with the ‌Apple TV‌ 4K for stereo sound. If you have HomeKit cameras, you can also now view multiple cameras at the same time on the ‌Apple TV‌.

                    <span>Nomad today announced the launch of the Base Station Mini with Magnetic Alignment, a small single-device charger designed for Apple&#x27;s iPhone 12 models.





The Base Station Mini with Magnetic Alignment features the same design as the original Base Station Mini, but it also includes integrated magnets that allow it to align more easily with MagSafe devices. This is not an official ‌MagSafe‌ accessory because ‌MagSafe‌ charging components need to be supplied from Apple and Apple has been slow getting the hardware to third-party companies.



As it is not using ‌MagSafe‌, the new Base Station Mini will charge an ‌iPhone 12‌ (and earlier iPhones) at a maximum of 7.5W, but it is a 15W charger so it can charge Qi-enabled Android smartphones more quickly. It is also compatible with AirPods and other Qi-based devices.



A USB-C cable comes along with it for charging purposes, and there&#x27;s a built-in light sensor that dims at night so it&#x27;s ideal for use on a night stand.



The Base Station Mini with Magnetic Alignment is available from the Nomad website for $69.95.

                    <span>Ahead of the theatrical release of James Bond film &quot;No Time To Die&quot; on October 8 in the United States, a 45-minute retrospective titled &quot;Being James Bond&quot; will be available to watch for free through the Apple TV app, according to Deadline.






The story from MGM is said to feature Daniel Craig reflecting on his 15 years playing Bond, with never-before-seen archival footage from his conversations with producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli. The retrospective will be available for free through the Apple TV app in over 30 regions from September 7 through October 7. 



Amazon in May announced it reached an agreement with MGM to acquire the entertainment company for $8.45 billion, following a report last year that claimed MGM had reached out to companies like Apple and Netflix to gauge interest in a potential acquisition. Amazon said it would help preserve MGM&#x27;s heritage and catalog of films, and provide customers with greater access to MGM&#x27;s existing works, such as the James Bond franchise.

                    <span>Android users are significantly less interested in the iPhone 13 models than they were this time last year in the iPhone 12 models, having been put off by the continued lack of a fingerprint scanner and concerns around child safety features, according to a new survey by SellCell.





The survey, conducted earlier this month, asked more than 5,000 current Android users in the United States aged 18 or over for their opinions about Apple&#x27;s upcoming products, revealing how the ‌iPhone 13‌ and Apple&#x27;s other expected products are viewed by customers of the rival platform ahead of their launch.



The survey found that 18.3 of Android users would consider switching to an ‌iPhone 13‌. This is a significant decline from last year when 33.1 percent of Android users were open to switching …</span>

                    <span>Kanye West&#x27;s latest album has achieved a new high for most streamed pop album of 2021 on Apple Music after its delayed release on Sunday (via Billboard). &quot;Donda&quot; set a record for the most streams in a 24-window on the service this year, pulling in over 60 million plays in the United States.





That makes &quot;Donda&quot; the third-most streamed album ever in the first 24 hours of a release. West&#x27;s album also topped ‌Apple Music‌&#x27;s top albums charts in 152 countries in the same time span, setting another record.



J Cole&#x27;s 2018 album &quot;KOD&quot; sits atop ‌Apple Music‌&#x27;s all-time debut chart with 64.5 million streams, followed by Drake&#x27;s &quot;Views,&quot; which courted around 63.5 million streams.



Following the arrival of &quot;Donda&quot; at the weekend, West claimed in an Instagram post that Universal, the parent company for Def Jam Recordings and West&#x27;s G.O.O.D. Music imprint, put the album out without his approval.



The album was originally supposed to arrive in late July, but West delayed it to August 6, then again to August 22, before the album eventually appeared on ‌Apple Music‌ and Spotify the following week.



West held a public listening party for the album on July 22 at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. Itended up breaking ‌‌Apple Music‌‌ livestreaming records with 3.3 million viewers tuning in. Even more ‌‌Apple Music‌‌ listeners participated in a second streaming event, which was held in Atlanta on August 5.

                    <span>South Korea today passed a bill that bans Apple and Google from requiring developers to use their own respective in-app purchasing systems, allowing developers to charge users using third-party payment methods,  The Wall Street Journal reports. 





The bill was originally supposed to be voted on yesterday, however, more urgent matters presented to South Korea&#x27;s National Assembly meant the bill was postponed. The bill is an amendment to the existing Telecommunications Business Act. It aims to ban Apple and Google from unfairly exploiting their market position to &quot;force a provider of mobile content, etc., to use a specific payment method.&quot;



Apple&#x27;s App Store has been under increased scrutiny in recent months. South Korea&#x27;s bill represents the first time any government has taken…</span>

                    <span>Three years after Apple released walkie-talkie functionality for the Apple Watch, Samsung has released a similar app for the Galaxy Watch 4 and Galaxy Watch 4 Classic. 





Samsung released the app via the Google Play Store, which was first spotted by XDA Developers. Similar to Apple&#x27;s own Apple Watch app, Samsung says its walkie-talkie app allows users to &quot;have instant conversations, just like if they were using a walkie-talkie.&quot; While the Apple Watch only allows two people to join in on a conversation, Samsung&#x27;s iteration allows for &quot;two or more users.&quot;



Samsung only lists the Galaxy Watch 4 and Galaxy Watch 4 Classic as compatible with the new app. Screenshots of the app on the Play Store reveal a similar interface to Apple&#x27;s walkie-talkie, featuring a large button to tap and hold to talk.

Development camp rolls on!
 Development camp is still rolling, and after the second day of on-ice activities, you guessed it, we had more player (and staff!) media availabilities. 
First up, we check in with Cara Morey, who’s the coach of the women’s team at Princeton and also serving as a guest coach for this camp, and then we hear from Tyson Foerster, Tanner Laczynski, and Linus Sandin. 
Cara Morey
On how the opportunity to join the staff for this camp arose. 
During the COVID year when our season was canceled, I spoke a little bit with Brent Flahr and had come into a couple meetings on analytics just to stay involved while our season was on hold. Then as development camp was approaching, they had asked if I’d like to come out and be a guest coach. That…</span>

Keyboard-and-mouse players grumble that their movement is nerfed across the board
 Apex Legends’ developers will patch out “tap strafing,” a form of player movement used mainly by PC gamers that allows them to make sharp turns to evade or counterattack less mobile opponents. Respawn Entertainment on Tuesday tweeted that the method would be eliminated with the next patch.
After much consideration and debate, we&#x27;ve decided to remove tap-strafing from @playapex in patch 10.1.
Our reasoning: It&#x27;s inaccessible, lacks readability/counterplay, and is exacerbated by movement abilities.
The next patch notes will include a…</span>

Crafting won’t be familiar, but Glaives will have that classic Bungie feel
 Weapon crafting will finally enter the Destiny universe in Destiny 2: The Witch Queen on Feb. 22, 2022. Bungie hasn’t revealed a great deal of information about this system just yet, but we spoke to Destiny 2 game director Joe Blackburn and general manager Justin Truman about how weapon crafting works, what it brings to Destiny, and the benefits of the crafting-only weapon: the glaive.
At last week’s Destiny Showcase, Bungie representatives referred to the crafting system as being “combat based,” but never gave a further explanation. In the original Destiny, weapons would drop for players with locked perks, and players would defeat enemies and spend resources to unlock a weapon’s full potent…</span>

The mode is set to launch on Oct. 12
 Hearthstone’s next game mode is Mercenaries, a turn-based RPG starring a tiny squad of Warcraft characters (and at least one non-Warcraft character). Players have a collection of Mercenary characters that they can pit against competing teams in both PvP and PvE modes. Blizzard will release Mercenaries on Oct. 12. 
Players will start with eight Mercenary characters and the main hub, a Village. The Village lets players manage their characters and base, then send their squad off on a procedurally generated Bounty run or a competitive match against another person. At launch, there will be over 50 Mercenaries, including the Lich King, Sylvanas, and Diablo (from the Diablo games, obviously). Completing the Mercenaries prologue also grants players a mouse mount in World of Warcraft.
There are three kinds of Mercenaries: Fighter, Caster, and Protector, which exist in a rock-paper-scissors system. Once players figure out their squad of three characters, they head into combat, which is turn-based. Each side picks their team’s actions, and then the round plays out. The format feels similar to Hearthstone’s Battlegrounds mode, with rounds split between decision making and action.
Hearthstone publisher Activision Blizzard faces wide-ranging allegations that it maintains a toxic workplace environment that is particularly hostile to women, pays them less, and subjects them to sexual harassment, and that perpetrators are not meaningfully punished, according to a lawsuit filed by California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing in July. You can read more about the allegations against Activision Blizzard in Polygon’s explainer. The lawsuit has caused many Warcraft fans to turn away from the franchise, with some using their remaining World of Warcraft game time to stage an in-game protest.</span>

Face of the Franchise’s nationally ranked teams, and Nebraska, stage alumni games through September
 The 10 college football programs that have participated in Madden NFL’s last two Face of the Franchise career narratives will cross over with Madden NFL 22’s Superstar KO mode, beginning Tuesday and running until Sept. 27.
The crossover means this is the first game where players can take a college football team into an online match against a friend since the dear departed NCAA Football 14 eight years ago. Superstar KO, a part of the game since Madden NFL 20, is a cooperative/competitive mode supporting teams of up to three players each; the matc…</span>

Suicide Squad was first revealed in 2020, when the cur…</span>

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/30/china-kids-online-video-game-ban/">

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(8 min)</span>
                    <span>China is implementing a new online gaming restriction that will affect children and teenagers who are under 18 years old, reports CNBC. Kids will only be able to play online games for an hour a day (8:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m.) on weekends and legal holidays. Weekday gaming is prohibited.





Companies that provide online game services to minors will need to comply with these rules and will not be able to offer the games to children outside of those hours. Gaming providers will also be required to have users register with their real names and users will need to be logged in to play. Gaming companies are responsible for ensuring minors are not accessing games outside of the permitted time.



The new rules are meant to safeguard children&#x27;s physical and mental health, and the National Press and Public Administration said that the guidelines address &quot;the problem of minors&#x27; excessive use&quot; of online gaming. China previously had a restriction that limited gameplay to 1.5 hours per day, but gaming was allowed on most days.



Tencent, a major gaming provider in China, said that only a small amount of its gaming revenue comes from younger players. The company plans to implement the new requirements, and earlier today, expressed support for the rules.



It&#x27;s not clear how these new rules will affect games that operate using the App Store. Apple Arcade is not a factor as it is not offered in China, but there are ‌App Store‌ games that require an online connection.



China in 2016 began requiring mobile gaming developers to officially license their games with the government, and in 2020, pressured Apple to remove ‌App Store‌ games from developers that did not comply. Apple has since pulled tens of thousands of games from the ‌App Store‌ in China.

The feature would also allow ‌iPhone‌ users to report crashes and other emergencies in areas where there is no cellular coverage.





There are at least two emergency features that will rely on satellite networks, and while satellite technology has been in the works for years, these capabilities are not likely to launch in 2021.



The first feature, Emergency Message via Satellite, is designed to let users text emergency services and contacts using a satellite network when there is no signal available, and it will be integrated into the Messages app as a third communications protocol alongside SMS and iMessage. It will feature gray message bu…</span>

Registered developers can download the beta through the Apple Developer Center and once the appropriate profile is installed, betas will be available through the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences.



As with all new betas, Apple recommends not installing the new macOS update on a primary machine because it is early release software and could have bugs.



‌macOS Monterey‌ introduces Universal Control, a feature that lets a single mouse, trackpad, and keyboard be used across multiple Mac or iPad devices, plus there&#x27;s a new AirPlay to Mac feature.

                    <span>Over the weekend, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo sent out a research note suggesting that the iPhone 13 was &quot;likely&quot; to support low earth orbit satellite communication, a feature that would allow iPhone users to make calls and send messages when cellular and WiFi connections are unavailable.





In this note, Kuo said that Apple would use a &quot;customized&quot; Qualcomm X60 baseband chip that supports satellite communications. He also claimed that Apple would work with Qualcomm partner Globalstar on the basis that Qualcomm is implementing support for Globalstar&#x27;s n53 band in a future modem.



Almost immediately, mobile analysts and those with other expertise in mobile devices and communications began disputing Kuo&#x27;s report as inaccurate.

                    <span>Apple has inked a deal for &quot;Raymond and Ray,&quot; an upcoming movie that&#x27;s set to star Ewan McGregor and Ethan Hawke.





The film is about two half brothers who have lived together in the shadow of their father, but still have a sense of humor. After their father dies, they have a chance to reinvent themselves.
&quot;Raymond and Ray&quot; follows half-brothers Raymond (played by Ewan McGregor) and Ray (played by Ethan Hawke) who have lived in the shadow of a terrible father. Somehow, they still each have a sense of humor, and his funeral is a chance for them to reinvent themselves. There&#x27;s anger, there&#x27;s pain, there&#x27;s folly, there might be love, and there&#x27;s definitely grave-digging.
Alfonso Cuarón is set to produce, while Rodrigo García will direct. García is known for &quot;In Treatment,&quot; &quot;Albert Nobbs,&quot; and &quot;Blue.&quot;



&quot;Raymond and Ray&quot; will join other Apple films that include &quot;CODA,&quot; &quot;Emancipation,&quot; &quot;Killers of the Flower Moon,&quot; &quot;Sharper,&quot; &quot;The Tragedy of Macbeth,&quot; &quot;Finch,&quot; and others.

                    <span>Instagram today said that it is now requiring all Instagram users to share their date of birth to &quot;create safer, more private experiences for young people.&quot;





Instagram users who have not already provided their birthday to Instagram will be prompted to share it. Instagram plans to ask for date of birth when the app is opened up, and will provide notifications asking for the information a handful of times.



Users will be required to share their birthdays to continue using the Instagram app. Instagram also plans to place warning screens on certain posts and will ask for a birthday before allowing the content to be viewed. This is the same interface that&#x27;s already in place for sensitive or graphic posts, but it will also now require a date of birth confirmation.



The age information will be used to create new safety features, and it will help ensure that the &quot;right experiences&quot; are provided to the &quot;right age group.&quot; Back in March, Instagram introduced changes to prevent adults from sending messages to users who are under 18, and last month, began defaulting new accounts for users 16 and under to private.



Instagram is developing &quot;new systems&quot; to address people inputting the incorrect date of birth, using AI to estimate how old people are. Going forward, if someone selects an age and Instagram&#x27;s technology disagrees, the app will offer a menu of options for age verification.

                    <span>Apple today announced that it has acquired classical music streaming service Primephonic, and will be folding it into Apple Music.





Primephonic offers an &quot;outstanding listening experience&quot; with search and browse functionality optimized for classical audio, plus handpicked recommendations and &quot;contextual details on repertoire and recordings.&quot;
&quot;We love and have a deep respect for classical music, and Primephonic has become a fan favorite for classical enthusiasts,&quot; said Oliver Schusser, Apple&#x27;s vice president of Apple Music and Beats. &quot;Together, we&#x27;re bringing great new classical features to Apple Music, and in the near future, we&#x27;ll deliver a dedicated classical experience that will truly be the best in the world.&quot;
Apple says that with the Primephonic purchase, ‌Apple Music‌ subscribers will be provided with an improved classical music experience. This will start with Primephonic playlists and audio content, and in the coming months, Apple will offer a dedicated Primephonic experience with improved browsing and search capabilities by composer and repertoire, better classical music metadata, and more.



Primephonic will be taken offline on September 7, and is no longer available for new subscribers. Next year, Apple says it will launch a dedicated classical music app that combines Primephonic&#x27;s classical user interface with added features.



Current Primephonic subscribers will receive six months of ‌Apple Music‌ access for free with access to hundreds of thousands of classical albums that support Lossless and Spatial Audio.

                    <span>Hyper today announced the launch of a set of HyperDrive USB-C hubs that are designed for Apple&#x27;s 24-inch M1 iMacs, and the hubs are unique because they come with faceplates available in each iMac color.





The HyperDrive 5-in-1 Hub features two 5Gb/s USB-C data ports, two 5Gb/s USB-A data ports, and one 5Gb/s USB-A port that also offers 7.5W charging for small devices. It&#x27;s priced at $50.

Each hub is about 5 inches long and 1.5 inches wide, and they are designed to clamp to the front of the ‌iMac‌ by using one of the rear USB-C ports. The hubs are sold with seven color matching faceplates so you can choose the one that works with your ‌iMac‌.

                    <span>Apple will be donating to Hurricane Ida relief and recovery efforts on the ground after the devastating category four storm made landfall in Louisiana over the weekend, according to a tweet from Apple CEO Tim Cook.





&quot;Our thoughts are with everyone in Hurricane Ida&#x27;s path, especially those sheltering in Louisiana, and we&#x27;re grateful for the first responders who are helping keep communities safe,&quot; said Cook. He did not provide any further details about the donation plans, including how much money the company will be donating or to who and where the funds will be distributed.

Hurricane Ida made landfall near Port Fourchon, Louisiana on Sunday with 150 mph wind speeds, becoming the second most intense hurricane to strike the U.S. state, behind only Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The storm has caused extensive damage in parts of Louisiana and resulted in nearly one million people being without power in New Orleans and elsewhere.



Apple routinely donates to relief efforts following natural disasters around the world, such as hurricanes, floods, and wildfires.

                    <span>Tapbots today released version 6.3 of Tweetbot for the iPhone and iPad, with the key new feature being a &quot;Behaviors&quot; menu in the app&#x27;s settings that contains several toggle switches for fine tuning your Tweetbot experience. 





For example, while tapping the status bar in the Tweetbot app will bring you to the top of your timeline by default, users who dislike this feature can now turn it off in the &quot;Behaviors&quot; menu by toggling off &quot;Tap to Top.&quot;

Here&#x27;s everything in the &quot;Behaviors&quot; menu to start:
- Enable/Disable Tap to Top. By default, tapping the status bar will bring you to the top of your timeline. If this happens by accident and bugs you, you can now turn this feature off.

- Enable/Disable Drag &amp; Drop Tweets. If you always accidentally invoke the drag and drop feature and wish there was a way to turn that off, now you can!

- Enable/Disable Swipe to Switch Themes. Swiping up or down with two fingers normally switches to the next or previous theme. If this happens by accident far too often you can now turn this feature off.

- Enable the ability to Customize All Tabs. For years many of you have asked for the ability to customize all the tab buttons in Tweetbot. Well, finally you can now turn this option on and set your tab menubar exactly how you wish.

- Before, the short right swipe on a tweet gesture was configurable between liking or retweeting. Now you can also customize this gesture to open link to tweet, copy link to tweet, copy tweet text, add to reading list, or be disabled completely.
The latest version of Tweetbot also features additional iPad keyboard shortcuts, a new custom app icon, a new &quot;Harvest&quot; light theme, and more.

                    <span>South Korea has delayed voting on a bill that would ban Apple and Google from requiring developers to use their in-app purchasing systems, a move that would open the door to allowing third-party payment methods, representing a possible significant threat to Apple and Google&#x27;s app marketplace business models.





The bill, coming in the form of an amendment to the existing Telecommunications Business Act, was widely reported to have been voted on today. However, the National Assembly&#x27;s schedule and agenda lacked mention of the amendment, instead focusing on other bills on the press, economy, and more. A date for the assembly to vote on the bill has not yet been set.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(8 min)</span>
                    <span>The government of Australia is considering creating new laws that could more heavily regulate digital payments systems such as Apple Pay, Google Pay, and WeChat Pay (via Reuters).





An Australian government-commissioned report into digital payments systems has made a number of recommendations, one of which suggested actively regulating ‌Apple Pay‌ and other similar digital payments services. Speaking to the Australian Financial Review, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said that the recommendations would be carefully considered:
Ultimately, if we do nothing to reform the current framework, it will be Silicon Valley alone that determines the future of our payments system, a critical piece of our economic infrastructure.




Under current Australian law, the likes of ‌Apple Pay‌ are not classified as payment systems, putting them outside payment regulations. Classifying ‌Apple Pay‌ as a payment system would clarify the regulatory status of digital wallets in Australia and allow the government to explicitly designate big tech companies as payment providers.



Other recommendations, contingent on classifying ‌Apple Pay‌ as a payment system, look to establish a strategy for the country&#x27;s wider payments ecosystem with a single, integrated licensing framework.



Australian banks such as the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia have previously raised concerns around the growth of digital wallets with &quot;competition issues&quot; and purported safety implications. Earlier this year, an Australian Parliamentary Committee considered forcing Apple to open up the iPhone&#x27;s NFC chip to support third-party payment systems in an effort to promote competition.

                    <span>Apple has today shared a trailer for &quot;The Problem with Jon Stewart&quot; and announced a companion podcast for the show, ahead of its premiere on Thursday, September 30.








Stewart himself stars in and executive produces the current affairs show, in what will be the former &quot;Daily Show&quot; host&#x27;s first series since he left Comedy Central in 2015. Apple describes the series as follows:



&quot;The Problem With Jon Stewart&quot; is a multiple-season, single-issue series, taking a deep dive on the issues affecting us most. In this new Apple Original series, Stewart will be in conversation with the people who are impacted by the issue — as well as those who have a hand in creating the impact. Together, they will discuss a more productive path towards action.




The Problem With Jon Stewart has been anticipated for almost a year, with Stewart having signed a multi-year partnership with Apple TV+. In July, Apple shared a short teaser for the show on Twitter that poked fun at the billionaire space race. 



The show is also set to be accompanied by a podcast series that will be available via Apple Podcasts and RSS, the company has today announced. 



The companion series podcast will extend the conversation from each episode, featuring staff members from across the show who will bring us interviews with activists in the space, the facts on the issue, and yes, lots of jokes.









A new episode of The Problem with Jon Stewart will follow on ‌Apple TV+‌ every other week from September 30. The first episode of the companion podcast will also debut on September 30, with new episodes every week where available.

                    <span>Michiko Kakutani, writing for The New York Times:
In 1960, while working as an artist and graphic designer, and some
years before the Rolling Stones were born, Charlie Watts began
work on “Ode to a High-Flying Bird,” a captivating children’s
book about his hero, the jazz great Charlie Parker. The book
featured charming drawings of a bird named Charlie who realized he
didn’t sound like most of the other birds, and who left home to
fly to New York City, where he played “from his heart” and made a
new nest for himself in “Birdland.”
Charlie Parker made a 14-year-old Charlie Watts dream the
impossible dream of visiting New York and playing at a jazz club.
And while he thought at the time that “the only way to get to New
York was in a band on a cruise ship,” he would actually get there
in 1964 with the Rolling Stones. While Keith Richards and Mick
Jagger hung out at the Apollo, where James Brown was doing
five — five! — shows a day, Mr. Watts spent his free time
haunting the jazz clubs he’d dreamed about as a boy: He saw
Charles Mingus at Birdland, Gene Krupa at the Metropole, and Sonny
Rollins, Earl Hines and Miles Davis.
Lovely memorial, with some great quotes from his bandmates.

It’s quote roundup time!
 At long last, development camp is here! The Flyers kicked off their on-ice sessions yesterday, and we were able to check in with some of the prospects for the first time in a few months, or in some cases, the first time ever. And with those first looks of the players on the ice, we also got to hear from a handful of the players to get some insight into their mindsets and goals heading into camp. Let’s check in with Egor Zamula, Wade Allison, Morgan Frost, Cam York, and Same Tuomaala, shall we?

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *A rare bit of fun happened in the NHL over the weekend, as the Carolina Hurricanes revealed a year-long grudge by offer-sheeting Jesperi Kotkaniemi, who obviously accepted their offer. [Canes Country] [Habs Eyes On The Prize]
*They’ll wait until the last possible moment to make their decision public, but the Habs probably won’t match. Because it doesn’t make sense for them to do so. [ProHockeyTalk]
*Anyway, the Flyers. Decidedly less fun over the weekend, but Development Camp got underway yesterday and we’re getting our first look — or first look in a while — at some of the young guys. Like Morgan Frost, who is coming off of surgery.

*In case you forgot, Sean Couturier is a very good dude who really really wants to be a Flyers. [NBC Sports Philly]
*And with the Coots contract out of the way, focus turns to Claude Giroux. Another good dude who really really wants to be a Flyers. [NBC Sports Philly]
*But the Flyers are in no rush with G. And that’s a good thing! [ProHockeyTalk]
*And finally, have you been keeping up with the women’s Worlds? We’re used to the Canada-USA rivalry in women’s hockey being rather evenly matched but so far, this year, Team Canada seems to be the best team running away. [The Athletic]</span>

 Hayao Miyazaki’s influence is seen beyond film, and in games across the entire industry. But never before have I felt as if I was playing inside of a Studio Ghibli film until my hourlong experience with Behind the Frame: The Finest Scenery.
Created by Taiwanese developer Silver Lining Studio, Behind the Frame is mostly a short, interactive-fiction game about a painter finishing a last piece of artwork before submitting it to a gallery in New York.
Behind the Frame takes place in the painter’s lush studio apartment over the course of a few  days as she slowly works her way through the painting. It’s easy to get pulled into the Ghibli-like style and animation, which is set to a soft, “lo-fi”  soundtrack. Painting happens leisurely: a stroke of yellow here, a swath of…</span>

Also fight off a horde of dangerous Sesame Street characters
 The moment I saw Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator I fell in love with how each organ pulses and writhes. In the game, you play as a powerful alien overlord, buying and selling organs. While you’ll spend plenty of time in the market, you’ll also get to choose what to do with those organs and who you kill for them.

Bungie doesn’t want players to feel like they’ve had abilities taken away in The Witch Queen
 At its Destiny Showcase last week, Bungie revealed that Destiny 2’s old Light subclasses will get the Stasis treatment, starting in The Witch Queen expansion and continuing throughout Year 5. While players seem to universally prefer to the less rigid Stasis upgrade path to the original Light ones, players may have had some concerns about what they might lose in the conversion. But in an interview with Polygon, Destiny 2 game director Joe Blackburn and general manager Justin Truman allayed those fears. 
“There are no plans right now, for us, for players to lose anything substantial in the conversion,” said Blackburn. “If you’re talking about something like Nova Warp, or if y…</span>

No more Conduit Energy, and switch Covenants without limitation
 World of Warcraft’s Shadowlands update 9.1.5 will roll out in the game’s public test realm this week, bringing with it a raft of player-requested and suggested changes, as well as new efforts to curb toxic behavior and sanction players who don’t get the message.
The 9.1.5 content update closely follows the 9.1 patch, which launched in June, four months after it was first announced. The 9.1 update was the first big content patch for World of Warcraft: Shadowlands since the expansion launched in November. The newest patch will allow players to switch Covenants without restriction (including the use of their cosmetic rewards), and will remove the Conduit Energy system, which was effectively…</span>

Motive Studio will discuss development in surprise stream
 Electronic Arts and developer Motive Studio will give Dead Space fans a “very early look” at the development of the sci-fi horror game’s remake on Tuesday. That sneak peek will be streamed on Motive’s Twitch channel on Aug. 31 at 1 p.m. EDT/10 a.m. PDT.
Given the language used in EA’s tweet — a “very early look at the development” — it’s unclear just how much we’ll see of the new Dead Space itself. EA and Motive didn’t promise a trailer or gameplay, so set your expectations accordingly. (EA hasn’t even announced a release window for the new Dead Space yet.)
The passionate team at @MotiveStudio are bringing you in for a very early look at the development of #DeadSpace.

The game was in beta for two years
 Lego Star Wars Battles, a mobile real-time strategy game that was shut down in July, is getting re-released as an Apple Arcade exclusive. The game was soft-launched in a few countries in 2019, and its servers were shuttered in 2021.
Developer TT Games Brighton announced the relaunch on Monday. The studio did not give an exact release date, saying only that the game is “coming soon.” Lego Star Wars Battles’ servers were unceremoniously shut off earlier this year, with players notified in advance via an in-game message.
“We are sorry to say that LEGO Star Wars Battles will be closing,” TT Games Brighton announced in May. The studio instructed players to use any remaining in-game currency before the game was taken offline on July 1. Media and Lego Star Wars Battles players took the shutdown to mean the game was canceled.
Polygon has reached out to publisher Warner Bros. Games for more information.
Soon to be available as an Apple Arcade exclusive, Lego Star Wars Battles will require a subscription. Games on Apple’s service are playable with a $4.99-a-month fee, which lets players access more than 150 titles. The games are ad-free, but playable only as long as a subscription is active. Sometimes, Apple Arcade exclusives will later receive a console or Windows PC release after some time.
Lego Star Wars Battles spans the franchise, but most importantly, there are porgs.</span>

                    <span>Steal some crypto for the resistance in Watch Dogs: Legion
 Watch Dogs: Legion now has heists. Well, at least one heist. In a new crossover event between Legion and Netflix show Money Heist, players can group up with friends to steal cryptocurrency from Clan Kelly — one of the game’s enemy factions. 
Players and up to three other friends can roll up to the Bank of London starting Monday in Watch Dogs: Legion. The group will take on Clan Kelly, some guards, and a powerful firewall while wearing the signature jumpsuits from Money Heist, as well as some Guy Fawkes-esque masks covering their faces. 
The trailer shows players sneaking through the bank at night, incapacitating guards with their buddies. But if going loud is more your style, the group will also have shotguns, pistols, and other weapons to keep guards and Clan Kelly on the backfoot. Once the heist crew has secured the crypto, it’s time to ride a drone in the night across the River Thames to make their escape.
Groups that complete the new Money Heist mission will unlock a new outfit for their recruits. 
This isn’t Legion’s first major crossover event this month, with several new, modern-day Assassin’s Creed missions appearing in the game last week alongside update 5.5.</span>

                    <span>The iPhone 13 will feature low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication connectivity to allow users to make calls and send messages in areas without 4G or 5G coverage, according to the reliable analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.





In a note to investors, seen by MacRumors, Kuo explained that the ‌iPhone 13‌ lineup will feature hardware that is able to connect to LEO satellites. If enabled with the relevant software features, this could allow ‌iPhone 13‌ users to make calls and send messages without the need for a 4G or 5G cellular connection.



The ‌iPhone 13‌ reportedly features a customized Qualcomm X60 baseband chip that supports satellite communications. Other smartphone brands are apparently currently waiting until 2022 to adopt the X65 baseband chip necessary to implement satellite…</span>

                    <span>Along with an increase in size for the upcoming Apple Watch Series 7, which is rumored to feature larger 41mm and 45mm sizes, Apple plans to include new watch faces that take advantage of the larger displays.





In the latest publication of his &quot;Power On&quot; newsletter, Bloomberg&#x27;s Mark Gurman has put his weight behind recent rumors suggesting that thanks to smaller bezels and a flat-edged design, the upcoming Apple Watch will feature larger case sizes. 



Compared to the current 40mm and 44mm sizes, the Series 7 will be offered in 41mm and 45mm variants. Gurman says that Apple plans to make the larger screen real-estate worthwhile by bundling it with new Apple Watch faces that utilize the larger displays.  

This year&#x27;s watches will come in 41-millimeter and 45-millimeter sizes, up from 40 and 44 millimeters. I&#x27;m told that Apple will bundle multiple new watch faces to take advantage of the bigger screen, including an updated Infograph Modular face. This will be the second time in the Apple Watch&#x27;s history that the company has increased the display size, following the Apple Watch Series 4 in 2017. 
The new Apple Watch faces will be exclusive to the Series 7 and will likely not be made available through a software update for older models. 



Besides cosmetic changes, the Apple Watch Series 7 is expected to include improved performance and battery life. The Apple Watch Series 7 is expected to be unveiled at an all-digital Apple Event in September alongside the iPhone 13. Learn more about what we&#x27;re expecting this fall using our guide.

                    <span>Apple has made season one of mystery drama &quot;Home Before Dark&quot; available to watch for free on Apple TV+ for a limited time, no subscription required.






The official announcement, delivered on Saturday in a tweet, comes three weeks after the conclusion of the second season. 



&quot;Home Before Dark&quot; is a drama series about Hilde Lysiak, a child journalist who published a newspaper called the Orange Street News in her hometown of Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania.



The series follows the young girl as she moves from Brooklyn to the small lakeside town her father is from, where she unearths a cold case that everyone else in the town had attempted to bury. 

A mystery inspired by the reporting of a real nine-year-old journalist. When a young girl and her family move back to the small town her father left behind, her pursuit of the truth leads to the unearthing of a long-buried cold case.
In real life, Hilde Lysiak was the first to report on a murder in her town of Selinsgrove, which gave her paper, Orange Street News, national and international media attention. Season 2 premiered on June 11.




For a limited time, you can watch Season 1 of Home Before Dark for free, exclusively on Apple TV+ https://t.co/lkdhusWjEN pic.twitter.com/jaDjSIk1Rv

‌Apple TV+‌‌ is available for a $4.99 per month subscription for the whole family, though Apple offers a free year of service with the purchase of an iPhone, iPad, Mac, iPod touch, or Apple TV.

                    <span>One of the most highly anticipated features coming to macOS Monterey and iPadOS 15 is Universal Control. Universal Control enables users to use a single Mac&#x27;s input devices across multiple iPads or Macs.





While the feature was previewed at WWDC in June, it&#x27;s yet to make an official appearance in any developer beta of ‌macOS Monterey‌ or ‌iPadOS 15‌, leading to speculation that the feature may be delayed to a future update to the operating systems. However, in the latest ‌macOS Monterey‌ beta released on August 11, Universal Control can be enabled and used between two Macs. 



To enable it, users will need to follow the steps outlined in this GitHub post, which requires running a series of Terminal lines, altering system settings, and running commands to enable &quot;Ensemble,&quot; Ap…</span>

                    <span>Keep in mind as you watch this that Jony Ive left Apple two years ago, and Apple dropped headphone jacks from new iPhones five years ago starting with the iPhones 7. Google’s own high-end Pixels dropped headphone jacks in 2017. As of next month, 40 percent of all iPhone model years will have been headphone-jack-free. This feels about as relevant as mocking the original iMac for not having a floppy drive.

                    <span>Yang Jie, Stephanie Yang, and Yoko Kubota, reporting for The Wall Street Journal (News+):
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. plans to increase the prices of its most advanced chips by roughly 10%, while less advanced chips used by customers like auto makers will cost about 20% more, these people said. The higher prices will generally take effect late this year or next year, the people said.
Apple Inc. is one of TSMC’s largest customers and its iPhones use advanced microprocessors made in TSMC foundries. It couldn’t be determined how much more Apple would pay.
Not just iPhones: TSMC manufactures all “Apple silicon”. And no one else can make them. Really, this is just Econ 101: demand for TSMC chips is high, supply is constrained, so prices are going up.
Update: Compelling alternative theory.

                    <span>We&#x27;re just weeks away from when Apple will announce the iPhone 13, which we&#x27;re expecting to feature some considerable upgrades, including design, performance, cameras, and more. Like every year, rumors, leaks, and reports about what Apple has in store are abundant, with some more credible than others.



 



Rumors about the next iPhone typically begin emerging early in the year, meaning they may get forgotten as the months go by and the new ‌iPhone‌ launch approaches. To help readers of MacRumors, we&#x27;ve compiled this top five list consisting of some rumors about the ‌iPhone 13‌ that you may have missed from the rumor news cycle.

                    <span>August is rapidly drawing to close, which means Apple&#x27;s annual iPhone launch event is right around the corner. iPhone 13 and Apple Watch Series 7 rumors are continuing to circulate, and we&#x27;re also hearing about Mac updates likely coming a bit later.





Apple is also finishing up work on its upcoming software updates like iOS 15, with some late-addition features starting to go live in beta while others have been pushed back a bit. Finally, this week saw a $100 million class action lawsuit settlement that will see Apple provide payments to small developers while the company makes a few other minor changes and commitments with its App Store policies, so read on for all the details on these stories and more!

                    <span>Apple today announced the launch of a new service program that addresses an issue that can cause some iPhone 12 and 12 Pro devices to experience sound issues. 





According to Apple, a &quot;very small percentage&quot; of ‌iPhone 12‌ and 12 Pro models may experience sound problems because of a component that can fail on the receiver module. Affected devices were manufactured between October 2020 and April 2021. 



‌iPhone 12‌ and 12 Pro owners who have a device that does not emit sound from the receiver when making or receiving phone calls may be eligible for free service. iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 12 Pro Max models are not affected and are not part of the service program. 



Those who have an iPhone experiencing issues can make an appointment at an Apple retail location, or find an Apple Authorized Service Provider. Apple Support can also be contacted to arrange a mail-in repair. 



‌iPhone 12‌ or 12 Pro models that have damage that impairs the ability to complete the repair, like a cracked screen, will need to have that issue fixed prior to receiving service. Apple says the repair program covers affected ‌iPhone 12‌ or 12 Pro devices for two years after the first retail sale of the device.

                    <span>Apple made some notable improvements to the Health app in iOS 15, primarily focused on helping iPhone users care for elderly parents and others who might need additional medical oversight and help.





There are extensive sharing features that let users keep an eye on the health data of a loved one, plus bonus features like walking steadiness metrics and improvements to how lab results are presented. This guide highlights all of the new additions in the ‌iOS 15‌ Health app.





Walking Steadiness


Walking Steadiness is a new health metric that uses data culled from the ‌iPhone‌ to provide insight into a person&#x27;s risk of falling down.





It uses algorithms that assess balance, strength, and gait, using metrics like walking speed, step length, and walking asymmetry d…</span>

                    <span>T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert today penned a letter to T-Mobile customers apologizing for the recent data breach that impacted more than 50 million current, former, and prospective T-Mobile users.





Data that included names, phone numbers, addresses, birth dates, social security numbers, driver&#x27;s license and ID info, IMEI numbers, and IMSI numbers was stolen and has been offered for sale.



&quot;We didn&#x27;t live up to the expectations we have for ourselves to protect our customers,&quot; wrote Sievert. &quot;Knowing that we failed to prevent this exposure is one of the hardest parts of this event.

                    <span>Apple is further pushing its employees in the United States to get vaccinated now that the Food and Drug Administration has officially approved the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, reports Bloomberg.





Apple has launched a new internal web page, sent out an employee memo, and is holding internal talks as part of its vaccination campaign.
&quot;Apple is asking everyone who has access to the vaccine and is able to get vaccinated to do so as soon as you can,&quot; the company said in the memo, which was sent to staff Thursday evening. Sumbul Desai, Apple&#x27;s vice president of health efforts, and Kristina Raspe, vice president in charge of real estate, are also hosting talks to encourage employees to get the shots.
The webpage Apple has created explains the delta variant and how getting vaccinated can help prevent its spread. Apple is also offering vouchers for employees to get vaccinated through Walgreens, and it is providing on-site vaccinations in the San Francisco Bay Area and Austin, Texas. Apple gives employees paid time off for vaccine appointments and paid sick leave for those who experience side effects.



Apple is not mandating that its employees get vaccinated, which is a departure from other tech companies in the area. Both Google and Facebook are requiring employees to be vaccinated, but according to Bloomberg, Apple has not done so for the sake of employee privacy.



Earlier this month, Apple implemented more frequent testing for corporate and retail employees, asking them to take COVID-19 tests up to three times per week.



Apple initially planned to have employees return to work for three days a week in September, but with cases continuing to ramp up, corporate employees will be able to work from home until at least January 2022.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Google today shared a new Pixel 5a ad that&#x27;s meant to parody some of the product intro videos that former Apple design chief Jony Ive used to make to highlight new iPhone features.






In the video, Google spends a full two minutes describing the design of the Pixel 5a&#x27;s headphone jack in exaggeratory language, and as noted by CNET, there are even two moments where the video uses Ive&#x27;s British pronunciation of aluminum. From the video description:
Calling this perfectly-symmetrical, technological marvel, a &quot;headphone jack&quot; may feel like an understatement...but technically, that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s called, so... fair enough. Behold! The Headphone Jack, on the Google Pixel 5a with 5G.
Since Jony Ive is no longer Apple&#x27;s design chief and does not make Apple&#x27;s product videos, it&#x27;s not clear why Google has opted to make a video imitating him two years after he left the company. A video promoting the headphone jack is also an unusual choice as fervor over the component has died down now that many high-end smartphones have eliminated it, including Google&#x27;s own flagship Pixel models. 



The $449 Pixel 5a goes on sale today. In addition to a headphone jack, it features a 6.3-inch display with hole punch camera cutout, IP67 water resistance, 5G connectivity, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G chip.



Google&#x27;s Pixel 5a competes with the $699 iPhone 12 mini and the $399 iPhone SE at the current time, but Apple plans to release an upgraded 5G version of the iPhone SE for 2022.

We&#x27;re not expecting new health features this year, and if there are new health sensors, Apple has kept them under wraps, but multiple rumors have indicated that the Apple Watch Series 7 is getting a new design.



The upcoming Apple Watch could feature a flat-edged design that&#x27;s similar to the design of the iPhone 12 and the iPad Pro. Leaked renders said to be based on CAD drawings have depicted iPhone-12 style flat curves, a thinner Digital Crown, and new speaker design on the left side of t…</span>

                    <span>Apple has shared a trailer for the original film &quot;Come From Away,&quot; which is set to debut on September 10, as an unlisted video on the Apple TV YouTube channel.






Directed by Christopher Ashley, who directed the original Broadway production, Come From Away is a recording of the Tony Award-winning Broadway musical of the same name that was filmed live at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theater in New York City.



The musical centers on the true story of when 38 flights were grounded in Gander, Newfoundland, leaving 7,000 passengers in a small Canadian town after flights into the United States were briefly suspended in 2001.
&quot;Come From Away&quot; tells the story of 7,000 people stranded in the small town of Gander, Newfoundland after all flights into the US are grounded on September 11, 2001. As the people of Newfoundland graciously welcome the &quot;come from aways&quot; into their community in the aftermath, the passengers and locals alike process what&#x27;s happened while finding love, laughter and new hope in the unlikely and lasting bonds that they forge.
Apple said earlier this year that the live performance of Come From Away was filmed in May with an audience of 9/11 survivors and front-line workers.



Come From Away premieres exclusively on Apple TV+ on Friday, September 10. &quot;The Problem With Jon Stewart,&quot; &quot;9/11: Inside the President&#x27;s War Room,&quot; &quot;The Morning Show&quot; Season 2, and &quot;Foundation&quot; are also set to arrive next month.

                    <span>Twitter has started rolling out its new Ticketed Spaces feature to iOS users, the company has announced.





Twitter Spaces allow users to host live audio discussions that other users can listen in to. Now, some Twitter users on iOS will be able to create Ticketed Spaces that have a small fee to join, allowing hosts to make money from sales directly on the popular social media platform.



Users over the age of 18 who have hosted at least three Spaces in the past 30 days and have at least 1,000 followers have been able to apply to host Ticketed Spaces since June, but the feature has not been live until now.




we want to help people creating cool Spaces make $$$. today, some Hosts will be able create Ticketed Spaces! 
we’re experimenting on iOS only for now but we hope to get it to everyone soon. know it’s taking us a little time, but we want to get this right for you! https://t.co/xc68yWkOim
— Spaces (@TwitterSpaces) August 26, 2021
 




Hosts receive 67 percent of the proceeds from ticket sales, with 30 percent going to Apple as an in-app purchase fee and three percent going to Twitter. If a host&#x27;s total lifetime earnings on Twitter pass $50,000, then Twitter plans to raise its commission rate to 20 percent.



It is not clear how many users are now eligible to host Ticketed Spaces or when Twitter plans to roll out the functionality to all users. Even so, any iOS user is able to buy a ticket to join a Ticketed Spaces session.

                    <span>Apple on Thursday evening announced it has reached a $100 million settlement that, pending court approval, will resolve a class action lawsuit from U.S. developers who alleged that Apple has a monopoly on the distribution of iOS apps and in-app purchases.





As part of the settlement, some U.S. developers would be entitled to receive a payment from Apple, so long as they meet certain requirements.



Who is eligible for a payment from Apple?


According to law firm Hagens Berman, which brought the lawsuit against Apple in 2019, the class includes any current or former U.S. developer of an iOS app that earned less than $1 million through the U.S. App Store in paid downloads and/or in-app purchases/subscriptions per calendar year between June 4, 2015 and April 26, 2021.

                    <span>Images purporting to show counterfeit clones of upcoming Apple Watch Series 7 models have been shared online, giving a closer look at the device&#x27;s expected redesign.





The images, shared in a tweet from the user known as &quot;Majin Bu,&quot; show counterfeit clones of the Apple Watch Series 7 in Space Gray, Silver, and Space Black. The design of the clones closely matches the redesign that is expected to bring squared-off edges to the Apple Watch, much like those of the iPhone 12 lineup, iPad Air, iPad Pro, and 24-inch iMac.



Although the units in the images are clones and not legitimate Apple devices, they may give the best impression yet of what we can expect the new Apple Watch design to look like in the real world. Majin Bu explained that these Apple Watch Series 7 clones will se…</span>

                    <span>It&#x27;s no secret that Apple and Google have a considerable monetary agreement that ensures Google&#x27;s position as the default search engine on Apple&#x27;s devices. In a new investor note by financial advisor Bernstein&#x27;s Toni Sacconaghi, the analyst claims Google&#x27;s payment to Apple to maintain the status quo could reach $15 billion in 2021, up from $10 billion last year.





First reported by Ped30, Sacconaghi&#x27;s note estimates that Google&#x27;s payments to Apple could continue increasing on-year and approach $18-20 billion in 2022. The Bernstein analyst bases his numbers on Apple&#x27;s public filings as well as a bottom-up analysis of Google&#x27;s traffic acquisition costs.

                    <span>Apple today announced plans to make several changes to the App Store in order to settle a class-action lawsuit that was brought against Apple by developers in the United States.





Under the terms of the deal, Apple will let developers use communication methods like email to tell customers about payment methods available outside of iOS apps, and it will expand the price points that developers can offer for apps, in-app purchases, and subscriptions. Apple also plans to create a $100 million &quot;fund&quot; for small developers as part of the settlement, and it will release annual transparency reports on the app review process.



Apple says that the settlement will make the ‌App Store‌ an &quot;even better business opportunity for developers&quot; while maintaining the safety of the ‌App Store‌.

                    <span>A blunt force assault of uncompromisingly loud and raw aggression, Gravpel returns to the origins of the genre. In times where black metal is mainstream, atmospheric or even avant-garde, this five-piece demolition squad aims to bring the danger back! A violent punk show and a finger to the face of all the miserable right-wing and […]

                    <span>The new age may have dawned in the 1960s, but it would never fully shine. For many, spiritual awakening would lead to something of an existential crisis as the harsh realities of the following decade began to encroach on their lives. Some found refuge in communes, others turned to drugs or diet fads. And many […]

On TikTok, Rolling Stone found videos, some of which had more than a million views, promoting ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment under tags like #ivermectin4covid and #ivermectinworks. TikTok has since removed the videos for violating community guidelines and blocked the tags, and a spokesperson says TikTok will continue removing related videos and hashtags. The #ivermectin tag is still up, though many of the most popular videos in the tag are of healthcare professionals debunking misinformation. 
On Reddit this week, moderators of several hundred subreddits called on the platform to take action against COVID-19 misinformation, including banning subreddits that spread medical disinformation.

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *Very exciting day yesterday, as a key player was locked up long term by his organization. Talking, of course, about the Svechnikov extension! [Canes Country]
*KIDDING. It was Coots Day yesterday and it’s going to be Coots time for the next eight years as the Flyers locked up arguably their best player for the longest possible term. [BSH]
*Charlie breaks down the details of the deal. [The Athletic]
*The contract Chuck worked out with Couturier turns out to be a real bargain for the Flyers, but still gives Coots the raise he has earned. [NBC Sports Philly]
*If he plays out this contract, Sean Couturier will be the longest-tenured Flyer in the organizations history. That’s wild! [Inquirer]
*The contract is unquestionably a good one, but deals this long don’t come without a little risk. [ProHockeyTalk]
*Anyway remember that little Derick Brassard signing? That was good too. [Flyers]
*Also, Dev Camp is upon us!! Here’s a look at the forwards we’ll be seeing this weekend. [Flyers]
*And finally, just in time for your weekend... new BSH Radio! A lot to talk about, obviously. All good stuff. [BSH]</span>

Pinnacle endgame content is Destiny’s lifeblood, and it’s about to get an infusion
 Bungie’s Destiny Showcase on Tuesday revealed a ton of exciting news for Guardians. Destiny 2 has a lot coming to it over the next few years, with crafting, three expansions, a new weapon type, reworks for existing subclasses, the return of Gjallarhorn, and a continuation into a whole new story after 2024’s The Final Shape expansion. But the showcase’s most important announcement came and went in a flash: Starting this December, Destiny 2 players will get a new raid or dungeon every three months. 
Destiny’s raids take six players to new locations and pit them against puzzle-filled arenas or giant bosses.…</span>

Bungie’s weekly blog highlighted what players can expect from their Void subclasses next February
 Bungie revealed at its Destiny Showcase that all of Destiny 2’s Light subclasses — Arc, Solar, and Void — will undergo a conversion to the Darkness/Stasis system over the next year. Just a few days later, the studio gave players their first look at the first subclass getting updated: Void. 
The studio first revealed that players won’t unlock a new Darkness subclass in The Witch Queen or any point before Destiny 2’s 2023 expansion, Lightfall — something creative director Joe Blackburn discussed on a Twitch stream an hour prior. Bungie also said players won’t unlock new Stasis Aspects or Fragments in Season of the Lost. 
For the uninitiated, Stasis offers the traditional …</span>

Boost your vitality and magic by praying at shrines
 Death’s Door can be hard to the low amount of vitality and magic you can have at once, but you can gain more of both by finding shrines. Shrines are hidden structures with monstrous faces found around the world, and they each give a crystal — pink for magic and green for health. Our Death’s Door guide will list out where to find all the shrines with maps.
There are 16 shrines throughout the game. Eight of them are for vitality and eight of them are for magic. To increase your health or magic bars, you need to collect four shards from shrines.
We’ve listed the shrines in the order you can access them below. Some of the shrines are in early areas, but require abilities that you don’t …</span>

                    <span>New Jersey’s Lorna Shore has come a long way since I reviewed their 2013 EP, Maleficum, a decent but standard deathcore release that had a few symphonic elements here and there. But through  2015s Psalms and 2017s Flesh Coffin, they gradually added more epic, symphonic elements, but they really didn’t register as something special at […]</span>

                    <span>Samsung earlier this month unveiled the new Galaxy Z Fold 3, its latest flagship foldable smartphone. We thought we&#x27;d check out the Z Fold 3 to see the technology improvements that Samsung has made to its foldable smartphone lineup.

Foldable smartphones are still expensive, and as a Samsung flagship, the Z Fold 3 is priced starting at $1,799.99, which is more than you have to shell out for some computers. Of course, this is meant to serve as both a phone and a tablet, so there&#x27;s a little more versatility than your average smartphone.





Design wise, the Z Fold 3 is Samsung&#x27;s best foldable device yet because the camera is under the display for an all-display design. It looks great and while it&#x27;s not entirely hid…</span>

                    <span>T-Mobile recently suffered a significant data breach that saw sensitive data from more than 50 million current, prospective, and former customers stolen.





John Binns, a 21-year-old American who lives in Turkey, told The Wall Street Journal that he is responsible for the attack. Binns said that he discovered an unprotected router in July after scanning T-Mobile&#x27;s known internet addresses for weak spots.



He used the unprotected router to access T-Mobile&#x27;s data center located in Washington, where stored credentials provided him access to over 100 servers. He said he initially panicked because he &quot;had access to something big,&quot; and went on to claim that T-Mobile&#x27;s &quot;security is awful.&quot;



It took him about a week to sort through the servers to find the personal data on milli…</span>

                    <span>Apple today released a new firmware update designed for the AirTag item trackers. The refreshed firmware has a version number of 1.0.291 and a build number of 1A291a, up from 1A287b.





There&#x27;s no word on what new features the firmware might add, but firmware released back in June added anti-stalking enhancements.



There is no way to force an AirTag update, as it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s done over-the-air through a connected iPhone. To make sure the update happens, you can put your AirTag in range of your ‌‌iPhone‌‌, but you have to wait for the firmware to roll out to your device.



You can check your current AirTag firmware version through the Find My app, with instructions available in our how to.

                    <span>Classic puzzle game Myst has been revived on the Mac and an optimized version of the title is now available for M1 Macs.





Cyan has undertaken a rework of the game that takes advantage of Metal 2.1 and AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution for a 50 percent performance boost on ‌M1‌ Macs that does not impact game quality.



Myst for ‌M1‌ Macs features improved modeling, textures, and dynamic lighting effects, and Apple&#x27;s machines are able to run the game at 4K resolution without noisy fans. It&#x27;s also been reimagined for a VR gaming experience.



Myst is compatible with both Intel and ‌M1‌ Macs. According to the system requirements, it works with the following machines:



 	
All MacBook Pros released since 2018


 	
All iMacs released since 2019


 	
All iMac Pros released since 2017


 	
All MacBook Airs released since 2018


 	
All Mac Pros released since 2019


 	
All Mac minis released since 2018




The updated version of Myst can be downloaded from the Mac App Store for $29.99.

                    <span>Netflix earlier this year confirmed plans to get into mobile gaming, and now the company is testing its gaming experience with Netflix users in Poland.





Netflix&#x27;s Polish Twitter account today tweeted that the Android Netflix app in Poland is offering access to &quot;Stranger Things 1984&quot; and &quot;Stranger Things 3,&quot; two mobile game options.



According to NetflixGeeked, the games are included with a Netflix membership and feature no ads or in-app purchases, similar to how Apple Arcade works. The games are downloaded directly to a mobile device from Netflix and are not streamed from the Netflix app. 



As noted by CNET, the games that are being offered have been available for a few years outside of the Netflix app and were created in partnership with Netflix for the second and third seasons of &quot;Stranger Things.&quot;



Back in July, Netflix said that it considered gaming to be another new content category, similar to its expansion into original films, animation, and unscripted television.



With its expansion into mobile gaming, Netflix will compete directly with ‌Apple Arcade‌, Apple&#x27;s $4.99 per month gaming service that allows users to access hundreds of ad-free games on the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV.



Given that the two games Netflix is experimenting with are already existing titles, we may need to wait for some time to see where Netflix plans to take its mobile gaming feature in the future.

                    <span>The Apple Watch continues to be the most popular smart watch on the market, and in Q2 2021, Apple hit a new user base milestone, according to Counterpoint Research&#x27;s Global Smartwatch Shipments Tracker.





There are now more than 100 million active Apple Watch users thanks to the device&#x27;s design, health features, and related services. It&#x27;s possible Apple hit this milestone even earlier than 2021, as Neil Cybart said in February that based on his estimates, Apple reached 100 million users in December.



In the second quarter of 2021, global smart watch shipments were up 27 percent overall, and Apple was able to maintain its number one position. Apple&#x27;s market share was at 28 percent, down slightly from 30 percent in the year-ago quarter, but well above competitors like Huawei, Samsung, and Garmin.



The United States continues to be Apple&#x27;s largest market, responsible for more than half of the Apple Watch user base.



During the quarter, the Apple Watch Series 6 was the most popular smart watch overall, followed by the Apple Watch SE. The Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 took the third spot, followed by the Apple Watch Series 3 in fourth and the Imoo Z6-4G in fifth.





Apple in just a few weeks is set to debut its newest wrist-worn device, the Apple Watch Series 7. The Series 7 will feature the first redesign we&#x27;ve seen in years, with Apple adopting a flat-edged design, a larger display, and new 41mm and 45mm case sizes.



We&#x27;re expecting Apple to debut the new Apple Watch Series 7 models alongside the iPhone 13 lineup, and we could be hearing details on an event date within the next two weeks.

                    <span>Refurbished M1 Mac mini models with a 10Gb ethernet port are now available from the Apple Store, following the launch of the $100 build-to-order option in April.





The refurbished units were first spotted by Paul Haddad on Twitter. There are currently a range of refurbished ‌M1‌ ‌Mac mini‌ configurations with 10Gb ethernet available with different amounts of storage, although stock appears to be selling out quickly. Going forward, stock will fluctuate based on which machines customers are sending back to Apple for repairs and returns.



Spot checks show that the refurbished ‌M1‌ models with 10Gb ethernet are now available in multiple regions, including the United States, Canada, France, and Japan.



When buying the ‌M1‌ ‌Mac mini‌ new, customers have to use a build-to-order configuration to upgrade from standard Gigabit ethernet to 10Gb ethernet for an additional $100. A refurbished ‌M1‌ ‌Mac mini‌ with 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and 10Gb ethernet sells for $849, which is a $150 saving on the same machine if bought new.



Apple&#x27;s refurbished ‌‌M1‌‌ Mac minis are sold with the same one-year warranty offered with a new ‌‌Mac mini‌, and they come with all manuals and accessories. Apple uses a rigorous testing, repair, repackaging, and cleaning process to ensure refurbished devices are identical to new devices.

                    <span>Apple today announced a News Partner Program that will allow publishers who are committed to publishing their content through Apple News to qualify for a reduced 15% commission rate on qualifying in-app subscriptions.





In exchange for maintaining a &quot;robust&quot; presence on Apple News, publishers enrolled in the program will receive 85% of the revenue from readers who subscribe through the publication&#x27;s own app on the App Store. By comparison, publishers currently receive 70% of revenue from readers who have been subscribed for less than one year and 85% of revenue from readers who have been subscribed for one year or longer.



Publishers may apply for the program starting today worldwide. To be eligible, publishers must maintain an Apple News channel and publish all content to that channel in the Apple News Format. Further details are available on Apple&#x27;s website.



Apple will also support, fund, and collaborate with additional media literacy organizations around the world, and the company has recommitted support to three leading non-profit organizations that offer independent media literacy programs, including Common Sense Media, the News Literacy Project, and Osservatorio Permanente Giovani-Editori.

                    <span>Days after celebrating his tenth anniversary at Apple&#x27;s helm, Tim Cook is poised to receive a whopping $750 million of Apple&#x27;s stock this week as the final installment of his pay deal with Apple, put in place over a decade ago when he took over the company, Bloomberg reports.





The installment will consist of 5 million shares of Apple&#x27;s stock, equating to be around worth $750 million, according to Bloomberg. Last year, Cook received restricted stock units worth up to $114 million, ensuring he&#x27;ll remain CEO until at least 2025.



Cook, aged 60, has a net worth of roughly $1.5 billion according to Bloomberg&#x27;s Billionaires Index. Though a billionaire, Cook&#x27;s compensation for 2020 was among the most modest compared to other high-paid tech CEOs. In 2020, Cook received $14.7 million, according to SEC filings. 



The CEO has said in the past he donates a portion of his salary and compensation to charitable organizations and plans to give most of his wealth away.

                    <span>Some Apple staff feel more confident to speak about their employer amongst themselves, to the press, and on social media due to the company&#x27;s switch to remote working and increased use of Slack over the past year, The Information reports.





Apple&#x27;s Slack became a &quot;virtual town square&quot; at the company, providing a platform for employees to protest the return to in-person work, decisions to hire controversial new employees, and more. Until the transition to remote working last year due to the global health crisis, Apple&#x27;s culture of secrecy limited the opportunities for grassroots employees to organize independently.



Apple employees are asked to sign multiple agreements vowing to not disclose information about their work, including to spouses and other colleagues at the compan…</span>

                    <span>An image purporting to show a &quot;45mm&quot; Apple Watch band has surfaced online ahead of the expected unveiling of Apple Watch Series 7 models next month.





The small, low-resolution image, shared by &quot;DuanRui&quot; on Twitter, originated from the Chinese social media network Weibo and appears to show the underside of an Apple Watch band, which could be a Saddle Brown Leather Link band. While it is not clear how reliable this image may be, the 45mm sizing lines up with a number of previous rumors around the Apple Watch Series 7.



Alleged CAD renders of the larger Apple Watch Series 7 suggested that it would sport a 45mm display, a 1mm increase from the current 44mm display on the larger Apple Watch Series 6 model. This is expected to be achieved by making the casing&#x27;s edges flat, which …</span>

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Apple supplier Foxconn is rushing to hire 200,000 more workers by the end of September to manufacture the iPhone 13 models, according to the South China Morning Post.





The 200,000 additional workers are needed at the world&#x27;s biggest iPhone factory in the Chinese city of Zhengzhou, ahead of the expected launch of the ‌iPhone 13‌ lineup next month. Hiring enough manpower has been the &quot;biggest bottleneck&quot; to production at the manufacturing facility, according to the site&#x27;s deputy general manager, Wang Xue, who was quoted by a local broadcaster. Earlier this month, it was reported that Foxconn was struggling to hire enough workers for ‌iPhone 13‌ production.



The staffing goal is reportedly being supported by local governments, which have provided 100 busses to &quot;pick up job applicants from their communities and drop them at the factory gates.&quot; Foxconn believes that it will be able to hire 200,000 new hires by the end of September &quot;at the current speed of recruitment.&quot; Once hired, new workers will be fast-tracked into their position. 



The Zhengzhou factory can accommodate as many as 350,000 assembly line workers and manufacture up to 500,000 new iPhones every day. The current hiring push seeks to combat ramped-up production for the ‌‌iPhone 13‌‌ models, which are believed to be on track for launch late next month.

                    <span>A photo purporting to show the sticker tabs used to seal Apple products in their boxes appears to confirm the &quot;iPhone 13&quot; name for the company&#x27;s upcoming 2021 iPhone lineup.





The photo was highlighted by &quot;DuanRui&quot; on Twitter, linking to a post on the Chinese social media network Weibo.



The validity of the image is not known, but it is not unusual to see images of ‌iPhone‌ packaging emerging at this time of year as the device&#x27;s launch date approaches. Around three weeks before the launch of the iPhone 12 lineup last year, images of packaging stickers showing the correct naming for those devices were also shared by DuanRui.



While most reliable sources have persistently referred to the 2021 ‌iPhone‌ models as the &quot;‌iPhone 13‌&quot; lineup, there has been a large amount of speculation from some observers on social media and a number of individuals who claim to be leakers with no track record that the upcoming iPhones would in fact be &quot;‌iPhone‌ 12S&quot; models.



A survey from earlier this year suggested that most consumers do not want the devices to be called the &quot;‌iPhone 13‌.&quot; 38 percent of survey respondents said that Apple should call its next smartphone series simply &quot;‌‌iPhone‌‌ (2021),&quot; 26 percent thought that the &quot;‌‌iPhone 13‌‌&quot; was the best name, and only 13 percent said that they would like to see the devices called the &quot;‌‌iPhone‌‌ 12S.&quot;



The ‌iPhone 13‌ lineup is expected to be unveiled next month with a number of new features, including a 120Hz display, larger batteries, new camera features, an &quot;A15&quot; chip, up to 1TB of storage, and more.

 The Philadelphia Flyers are continuing to be at the center of the NHL offseason.
Announced by the team on Thursday afternoon, they have signed top center Sean Couturier to an eight-year, $62-million ($7.75-million AAV) contract. Keeping him with the Flyers through the 2029-2030 season.

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *The Flyers’ options at center remained the one lingering question as we head into the start of the preseason festivities, so Chuck went ahead and filled in that hole a little bit with another bottom-6 C option for Alain Vigneault to consider. [BSH]
*Vigneault has some history with the new hire too, which might make his decision easier. [NBC Sports Philly]
*Charlie breaks down the signing, as only Charlie can. [The Athletic]
*Speaking of contracts, it’s a contract season for Sean Couturier, arguably the Flyers’ most important player at the moment. So it’s going to be a big season. Big big season. [The Athletic]
*Our last-season reviews continue with everyone’s favorite youth, Joel Farabee... [BSH]
*... and also everyone’s favorite bottom-sixer, Scott Laughton. [BSH]
*As folks begin to preview the season, a look around the Metro suggests that Chuck’s offseason moves weren’t enough — on their own — to make people believe in the Flyers again. [ProHockeyTalk]
*Noted hilarious writer known as DGB has put together fictitious NHL rosters based on some wackadoo parameters in the past, but this one might be the wackadooiest of them all.  Which of course is why it is so fun. [The Athletic]
*And finally, Flyers Aquaman, dream or nightmare? [BSH]</span>

This is April’s second big announcement out of Gamescom
 Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl’s cast is growing by two ... or maybe three? April O’Neil and CatDog are both coming to Nickelodeon’s upcoming fighting game, developers Ludosity and Fair Play Labs announced on Thursday at Gamescom 2021.
April is the beloved friend to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles — several of which are also coming to All-Star Brawl. Based on her trailer, April’s in-game moves will lean into her role as a TV reporter, using her camera as a weapon in some of her attacks, while other will have her deploy a few of the turtles’ weapons as well. 
Weirdly, this is the second game that April has been announced as a playable character in at Gamescom 2021 so far, after she was announced as part of the cast of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge on Wednesday. 
Meanwhile, CatDog fits right at home in All-Star Brawl’s list of fan-favorite characters from old NickToons. CatDog looks fittingly strange in-game and seems to have a move set that takes advantage of both ... halves of their body. It seems like players might even get unique moves depending on which direction CatDog is facing, since Cat and Dog may do slightly different things. 
Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is set to be released on Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X later this year.</span>

The Destiny Timeline is a godsend for players trying to get into Destiny
 Destiny 2’s new Season of the Lost offers the biggest patch of the year. Some of those major changes are large, like a suite of new seasonal activities, weapons, and Exotics. But one of my favorite changes is so small that you might miss it entirely: the Timeline.
Billed in the patch notes for Season of the Lost as a way for players to see what expansions and seasons they own — and purchase any outliers, if they desire — the Timeline is much more than a store. It’s a visual representation of everything that’s happened in Destiny 2 since it launched in 2017. And for new players, it’s a great place to learn what the hell is going on with the baseline story before watching your way int…</span>

Stasis won’t be the only Darkness power forever
 Bungie hasn’t been shy about calling Destiny 2: Beyond Light’s Stasis subclass the “first” new Darkness power set. So Guardians may have been surprised during Tuesday’s Destiny Showcase when Bungie didn’t reveal a new element. In an interview for Twitch’s The Weekly show, Destiny 2 game director Joe Blackburn confirmed that players won’t see a new powerset in The Witch Queen expansion. But he also revealed that one is in development for a future update.
“We knew when we wanted to add another damage type to Destiny, we needed to take more time,” said Blackburn. “We’re not doing a new damage sub-type for Witch Queen. We have one in development, you’re gonna see it eventually, but we really want to make sure we get it right.”
Blackburn went on to speak about the Light subclass rework, which will use the Stasis system added to the game in Beyond Light. The creative director talked up the new reworks for these Light subclasses, suggesting that longtime players will have a lot more tools and combinations to play with. 
It’s currently unclear what the fifth subclass type will be in Destiny 2 — or when players will get their hands on it. But it seems likely that players will have three Light and three Darkness subclasses by the time Destiny 2’s first saga — the battle between Light and Dark — ends with The Final Shape expansion in 2024.</span>

Welcome to Malevento
 Overwatch is primarily a team-based game, but occasionally you prefer something a little less cooperative and a little more aggressive. That’s where the free-for-all deathmatch mode comes in. Eight players battle it out on a map in a frantic race to 20 kills. For fans of this game mode, a new map is coming. Malevento will be the next free-for-all deathmatch map, and it’s coming to the game’s Public Test Region (PTR) on Windows PC today.
Malevento is a Talon base located in Italy, so it’ll likely have a few Easter eggs and lore hints for sharp-eyed fans. This is only the fourth map that is designed specifically for Deathmatch.

 Blizzard Entertainment says it will rename McCree, Overwatch’s outlaw bounty hunter, after his real-life namesake, former game designer Jesse McCree, was let go from the studio in the wake of a sexual harassment and gender discrimination lawsuit filed against publisher Activision Blizzard.
“We believe it’s necessary to change the name of the hero currently known as McCree to something that better represents what Overwatch stands for,” Blizzard’s Overwatch team said in a statement posted Thursday to Twitter announcing the name change.

It’ll be the first Skate game on Windows
 Skate fans with a PC, breathe easy. The newest Skate game — which everyone is calling Skate 4, at least until its actual title is revealed — will be launching on your platform, Electronic Arts said Thursday.
Again, no extra details beyond that; Full Circle developers dropped this quick PC-themed tweet, then got back to work:

The first three games in EA’s Skate franchise were all console-only, for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Skate fans had worried that a gamepad-intensive game might leave them out, but the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 remaster showed the sport does do well as a Windows PC video game, pulling review scores consistent with console versions’ strong marks.
The next Skate game is in development at Full Circle, a studio formed expressly to handle this sequel. Designers said their project was brought to life purely thanks to fan feedback and social media clamor for a series revival. The Skate franchise’s three games were published between 2007 and 2010.</span>

Discover the March Through Time exhibit from Time Studios
 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s famous “I Have a Dream” speech is now viewable in a Fortnite exhibit. 
Time Studios has launched a new interactive educational experience inside Fortnite Creative called March Through Time. This event acts as a virtual museum for players to explore Washington circa 1963, at the height of the Civil Rights Movement. 
Fortnite players can visit the Lincoln Memorial and the National Mall. They can watch King’s famous speech, which Epic and Time Studios licensed from his family’s estate — a critical piece of history that even the Oscar-nominated 2014 biopic Selma wasn’t able to feature. The interactive exhibit is arriving ahead of the 58th anniversary of the “I Have a Dream” speech, which King delivered from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial on Aug. 28, 1963, during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.

      Players can unlock this Fortnite spray by exploring the MLK exhibit.
  
After the speech, players can further explore the in-game museum and even work together in cooperative minigames. After completing various challenges and exploring the museum, Fortnite players can pick up a “DC 63” wall spray for use in the game.
Fortnite players can dive into the March Through Time experience by finding the link in the Discover Menu, or by inputting a special island code: 3815-8892-143.
The makers of huge gaming platforms like Fortnite are increasingly using them for interactive experiences beyond video games, such as educational opportunities. Last July, after the murder of George Floyd, Fortnite hosted a discussion on race in America. Minecraft also features civil rights education in its Lessons in Good Trouble pack, which features the late congressman John Lewis.
March Through Time was inspired by The March, a 2020 digital exhibit from Time magazine, and was developed by Fortnite community members ChaseJackman, GQuanoe, XWDFr, and YU7A.</span>

Konami on Thursday published a six-minute trailer showing what that’ll look like, and what players will be able to do with eFootball’s reconstituted attacking and defending controls.
Konami’s developers are focusing on the one-on-one confrontations in soccer, and they’re opening up the ball-handling system to allow attackers more moves to break down a defender. At the same time, defenders who are able to anticipate their opponent’s passes and dribble moves should have a better shot at taking control of the ball — making countera…</span>

The classics get revived on iOS, PC, Switch
 You can play another Pokémon-like game later this year, thanks to the upcoming arrival of Monster Rancher 1 &amp; 2 DX, the remaster of the retro monster collecting games from Koei Tecmo. The collection bundles Monster Rancher (1997) and Monster Rancher 2 (1999), and will launch Dec. 9 on Nintendo Switch, Windows PC via Steam, and iOS, Koei Tecmo announced Thursday.
In the Monster Rancher games, players raise monsters and train them to compete against other creatures in combat and tournaments, just like in Pokémon. The original Monster Rancher launched with a fun gimmick where players could use physical CDs to unlock monsters in the game, with each CD corresponding to a monster. 
Most people don’t use CDs anymore, but the developers found a way to rework the feature into their modern version of the game. In Monster Rancher 1 &amp; 2 DX, you’ll be able to search a database to find each monster’s desired CD and generate a monster from its data. 


The re-release will include new content that wasn’t in the original Western release, like additional save slots, Freeze slots, and Monster Hall of Fame slots. The newer version will bring a few other improvements to gameplay, as well. Players will now be able to use a memo feature while raising monsters, view rankings from random battles, and use a high-speed mode to play through the game faster. 
The Monster Rancher reboots are but a few of the many Pokémon-likes that have been announced or released in recent years. There’s Temtem, a hardcore MMO version of Pokémon released in 2020, and Palword, a game that takes the concept of raising cute monsters and turns it into a brutal survival game, which is due sometime in 2022. Or also, you could just play one of the many actual Pokémon games that are slated to be released in the next few months, like Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl or Pokémon Legends: Arceus.</span>

                    <span>Hi folks. I am taking the rest of August off to spend some time with my family near the ocean. I might extend that through Labor Day weekend, who knows? After hitting it hard here during the first year of the pandemic1 — especially in the first several months — I’ve slowed up a bit this summer to give myself some space to recuperate and reconnect with other areas of my life. That’s been nice &amp; necessary and I’m thankful to have a work situation that allows me to do that, but I plan to be back here in September with a renewed vigor. I hope you have a nice rest of your summer (or winter — I see you southern hemisphere) and I’ll see you back here soon. Stay safe, everyone.

“The first year of the pandemic” — even just writing that tightens the chest.↩

                    <span>It may seem like sometimes that with the pandemic, we’re back to square one. With the much more contagious Delta variant in play and an increasing number of breakthrough infections, the efficacy of these vaccines that we thought were amazing maybe aren’t? (Or maybe we just need to readjust our expectations?) But in terms of what these vaccines were specifically developed for — reducing &amp; preventing severe disease and death — they are still very much doing their job. Just take a look at this graph from a White House Covid-19 press briefing yesterday:

Even with Delta endemic in the country, the vaccines are providing extraordinary protection against infections severe enough to land folks in the hospital. In a recent CDC study of infections and hospitalizations in Los Angeles County, they report that on July 25, the hospitalization rate of unvaccinated people was 29.2 times that of fully vaccinated persons. 29 times the protection is astounding for a medical intervention. These vaccines work, we’re lucky to have them, and we need to get as many people worldwide as we can vaccinated as quickly as we can. Period.

                    <span>Apple CEO Tim Cook this morning attended a cybersecurity meeting with U.S. Joe Biden and executives from other tech companies like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon.





Following the summit, the White House said that the companies in attendance pledged their help to bolster U.S. cybersecurity efforts, with Apple planning to develop a program to make security improvements across its technology supply chain (via Bloomberg and CNBC).



Apple will work with suppliers to adopt multi-factor authentication, security training, and incident response in an effort to improve security.



Google plans to invest $10 billion over five years to strengthen cybersecurity, and it plans to train 100,000 Americans in technical fields through its Career Certificate Program. Microsoft pledged $20 billion over five years to provide more advanced security tools and will invest $150 million to help government agencies upgrade their security systems.



IBM plans to train more than 150,000 people in cybersecurity skills across three years, and it announced a new data storage solution for critical infrastructure companies. Amazon Web Services plans to give account holders free multi-factor authentication devices to improve security, and it will also offer Security Awareness Training.



During the meeting, President Joe Biden asked tech executives to help improve cybersecurity for critical infrastructure and economy, urging them to train up a larger cybersecurity workforce and to provide improvements to cybersecurity in their sectors.

                    <span>iOS 15 didn&#x27;t focus heavily on improvements to HomeKit and the Home app, but there are some notable features like expanded HomeKit Secure Video support and new Siri functionality.

‌iOS 15‌ introduces a new iCloud+ service that offers privacy-based features like ‌iCloud‌ Private Relay and Hide My Email, but the feature also comes with ‌HomeKit Secure Video‌ improvements.





With ‌iCloud‌+, Apple is increasing the number of ‌HomeKit Secure Video‌ cameras supported with each ‌iCloud‌ plan. There have been no changes to ‌iCloud‌ plans and all ‌iCloud‌ plans are now ‌iCloud‌+ plans, but more camera footage can be stored.

                    <span>When iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 launch this fall, iCloud Private Relay will be included, but Apple plans to provide the features as a public beta rather than a finalized addition.





According to Apple&#x27;s release notes for the seventh beta of ‌iOS 15‌, ‌iCloud‌ Private Relay is being released as a public beta to allow Apple to &quot;gather additional feedback and improve website compatibility&quot; before the official launch of the feature.



So when ‌iOS 15‌ and the other updates are released, ‌iCloud‌ Private Relay will be available for customers to use, but it will officially be usable in a beta capacity.

                    <span>Apple today seeded the seventh beta of the upcoming watchOS 8 update to developers for testing purposes, with the update coming one week after Apple released the sixth watchOS 8 beta.





To install ‌‌watchOS 8‌‌, developers will need to download the configuration profile from the Apple Developer Center. Once installed, ‌‌watchOS 8‌‌ can be downloaded through the dedicated Apple Watch app on the iPhone by going to General &gt; Software update.



To update to new software, an Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery life, it must be placed on the charger, and it needs to be in range of the ‌‌iPhone‌‌. It&#x27;s not recommended to install ‌‌watchOS 8‌‌ on a main Apple Watch as the software may be unstable at this early date.

Developers can download the new tvOS 15 beta by downloading a profile onto the ‌Apple TV‌ using Xcode.



Apple shared little about tvOS 15 when it was unveiled, but there are some new features that are coming to the operating system. SharePlay, a FaceTime feature that lets multiple users watch TV shows or movies together, will integrate with tvOS, and there&#x27;s a new &quot;For All of You&quot; recommendation engine that suggests shows everyone might enjoy.



A Shared With You section also displays movies and shows that were shared with you through the Messages app so you remember to check them out. When paired with AirPods Pro or AirPods Max, the ‌Apple TV‌ supports Spatial audio for a theater-like surround sound experience, and there&#x27;s a new feature for automatically connecting your AirPods through Smart ‌AirPods‌ routing.



Hey Siri commands can be used to launch Apple TV+ shows, and two HomePod mini speakers can be paired with the ‌Apple TV‌ 4K for stereo sound. If you have HomeKit cameras, you can also now view multiple cameras at the same time on the ‌Apple TV‌.

As part of its Tech Transparency Project, the watchdog group said it set up an Apple ID for a fictitious 14-year-old user and used it to download and test 75 apps in the App Store across several adult-oriented genres: dating, hookups, online chat, and casino/gambling. Despite all of these apps being designated as 17+ on the App Store, the investigation found the underage user could easily evade the apps&#x27; age restrictions.

Via his website FrontPageTech.com, Prosser explained that Apple is testing more advanced Face ID hardware using a case that fits snugly around an iPhone 12. The case allows the ‌iPhone‌ to bypass its built-in Face ID system to use that of the case instead.



Prosser believes that the prototype Face ID array matches the exact layout depicted in CAD files of the iPhone 13 from earlier this year. This is because the prototype Face ID hardware in the case is considerably narrower than that of the ‌iPhone 12‌, which would line up with the slimmer notch that is e…</span>

After entering a custom domain on the iCloud website, users can add email addresses that they currently use with the domain. Users can also create new email addresses after they have finished setting up the domain with iCloud, according to Apple. Note that any custom email addresses must not be in use with another Apple ID.





For those who missed the announcement back at WWDC in June, iCloud+ is Apple&#x27;s new branding for paid iCloud storage combined with new features like iCloud Private Relay and Hide My Email. iCloud+ features are included with iCloud storage plans at no additional cost, with prices remaining set at $0.99 per month for 50GB of storage, $2.99 per month for 200GB of storage, or $9.99 per month for 2TB of storage in the United States.



The ability to use a custom email address for iCloud is not to be confused with Hide My Email, a separate iCloud+ feature that allows users to create unique, random email addresses that forward to their personal inbox so they can send and receive email without having to share their real email address.

                    <span>The iPhone has failed to serve as a gateway product to the Mac, Apple TV, and HomePod for over 50 percent of ‌iPhone‌ users, while the iPad, Apple Watch, and AirPods have seen considerably better popularity among ‌iPhone‌ owners, according to data gathered by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP).



The device ownership of ‌iPhone‌ buyers (twelve months ending June 2021).




The CIRP investigation sought to ascertain the extent to which ‌iPhone‌ users have bought other Apple devices, given the fact that Apple seeks to cross-sell its entire product line to its core customers. 



The study highlighted a contrast between personal computers and tablets for most ‌iPhone‌ owners. While almost all ‌iPhone‌ users have a computer, only a 41 percent share of these users have …</span>

                    <span>Today we&#x27;re tracking a few deals at Best Buy, including record low prices on the iPhone 12 mini and iPad mini 5.



Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.



iPhone 12 mini


To start, you can get Apple&#x27;s 64GB iPhone 12 mini from T-Mobile for $429.99, down from $729.99. This $300 off discount is only available when you select T-Mobile as a carrier, and it&#x27;s a one-time payment that requires activation with T-Mobile at purchase.




$300 OFF
64GB iPhone 12 mini for $429.99





You can save $300 on most models of the iPhone 12 mini: the 128GB is available for $479.99, and the 256GB is available for $579.99. Additionally, Best Buy is offering $75 off some iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max models. Note that all of these savings are seen only under T-Mobile on Best Buy.



iPad mini 5


Best Buy also has $100 off Apple&#x27;s iPad mini 5, starting at $299.99 for 64GB Wi-Fi, down from $399.99. You can also get the 256GB Wi-Fi model for $449.99, down from $549.99.




$100 OFF
64GB iPad mini 5 for $299.99





Both sales represent matches for the previous all-time low prices on the iPad mini 5. We&#x27;re expecting a refresh of the iPad mini lineup sometime this fall, which is likely the reason why we&#x27;re now seeing frequent discounts on the 2019 model.

                    <span>Facebook today announced updates coming to Facebook Messenger as the app and service celebrates its tenth birthday. The new features include a new game, tighter integration with Facebook Pay, message effects, and more. 





For Messenger users in the United States, Messenger now allows you to receive cash gifts directly within the app. This is being enabled thanks to Facebook Pay, and when cash is received, it comes wrapped in a gift with virtual balloons. 

In the US, we&#x27;re introducing a new way to receive cash gifts directly through Messenger. When a friend sends you a cash gift for your birthday, you&#x27;ll be notified on Messenger and Facebook with their gift message wrapped and accompanied by virtual balloons. Once you confirm your Facebook Pay details, the cash gift will be instantly deposited into your bank account. To send a birthday cash gift, go to the Facebook mobile app and tap the button that appears alongside your friend&#x27;s birthday posts in your Facebook News Feed or their profile.
Within the app, Messenger users will now be able to conduct polls within group chats, allowing groups to easily vote on specific topics and play &quot;Most Likely to.&quot;



In more celebratory features, Messenger is releasing a new &quot;Messenger is 10!&quot; sticker pack to users, offering fun effects such as purple balloons or candles. Announced previously, users can also utilize &quot;Soundmoji&quot; and message effects to spruce up their chats.



Smaller features include an updated way to share contacts with other friends and family, and a sneak peek at &quot;Word Effects.&quot; According to Messenger, Word Effects will be rolling out soon and will let users add specific emoji effects to specific words.

                    <span>Zoom today announced the latest version of its popular video conferencing app, and one of the key new features is gesture recognition on the iPad, enabling users to use visual gestures to automatically use a corresponding meeting reaction.





The feature currently supports the &quot;Raise Hand&quot; and &quot;Thumbs Up&quot; reactions. If you raise your hand or give a thumbs up in real life, a hand or thumbs up icon will automatically appear alongside your video feed in a Zoom meeting. A raised hand typically indicates that you have a question and would like to be unmuted to speak.



Zoom has also received a new Focus Mode, chat sidebar enhancements, and several other new features, as outlined in the full release notes.



iPad and iPhone users can update to the latest version of Zoom through the App Store.

                    <span>Apple is preparing to open its first retail store in the Chinese province of Hunan, according to a new official webpage on the company&#x27;s website, as well as images shared on Twitter.





The official webpage offers no date for when the store will launch; however, its opening could be relatively close given the store is plastered with marketing material in anticipation. Apple is advertising the store with the following tagline [translated]:

The first law to open your mind is that there is no law. In Changsha, it is a great truth not to set limits for Reiki. Apple Changsha welcomes all kinds of whimsical ideas to let go of their hands and feet and break out of their own world.
On its website, Apple offers wallpapers for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac to celebrate the store&#x27;s opening. The new store will be the first retail store for the Hunan province.

                    <span>Apple today shared a new &quot;Today at Apple&quot; session on YouTube, exploring how to shoot expressive pet portrait photos, with the help of photographer Sophie Gamand and Jahmyra from Today at Apple.








The playful session encourages participants to use their iPhone at the correct height, tune into the pet&#x27;s personality, and take a look at showcase pet portraits for inspiration and top takeaways.



Apple says its free Today at Apple sessions are meant to inspire hands-on creativity in photography, art, design, video, coding, music, and more using Apple products and accessories like the ‌‌iPhone‌‌, iPad, Mac, and Apple Pencil. Initially hosted exclusively at Apple Stores, the sessions started to be offered online during the global health crisis, and Apple also started uploading sessions to YouTube last month.



This is the fifth Today at Apple session uploaded to YouTube, with previous sessions looking at drawing yourself as a &quot;Peanuts&quot; character in the Pages app using an ‌‌iPad‌‌ and ‌‌Apple Pencil‌‌, shooting and editing &quot;otherworldly&quot; photos with Night Mode, creating looped videos in the Clips app, and shooting portrait photos.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/25/youtube-premium-users-ios-picture-in-picture/">

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Google has rolled out picture-in-picture support as an &quot;experimental&quot; feature for YouTube premium subscribers, allowing them to watch video in a small window when the app is closed.





If you&#x27;re a premium YouTube subscriber looking to try out picture-in-picture, follow these steps: 


Launch a web browser and sign into your YouTube account at YouTube.com.

Navigate to www.youtube.com/new.


Scroll down to &quot;Picture-in-picture on iOS&quot;.


Click &quot;Try it out.&quot;
Now, when you&#x27;re in the YouTube app watching a video, return to your Home Screen by swiping up/pressing the Home button, and the picture-in-picture mini player will pop up. Google notes that locking your phone when watching in picture-in-picture mode will pause the video, but you can resume it by using the Lock Screen media controls.





Google in June announced that picture-in-picture support would be rolling out to both premium and non-paying YouTube app users in the U.S., but some people outside the U.S. have been able to get the experimental feature working, so it could be globally available. 


How to Use Picture in Picture Mode on iPhone


However, Google says the feature is only available until October 31. The company doesn&#x27;t explain what happens after that, but hopefully that&#x27;s when support rolls out to both paying subscribers and non-paying users, as originally promised. Whether it will still be available globally outside of its &quot;experimental&quot; context remains to be seen, though.

                    <span>Apple may be planning to launch the iPhone 13 on Friday, September 17 and third-generation AirPods on Thursday, September 30, according to an image of an e-commerce app discovered by Chinese language site IT Home.





The screenshot, originally posted by Weibo account @PandaIsBald, suggests all four ‌iPhone 13‌ models will go on sale on September 17, followed by the ‌AirPods‌ 3 on September 30.



Apart from the image, which could be easily faked, IT Home offers no other information to back up the claim, and the website has shared screenshots in the past that turned out to be inaccurate, so the above information should be taken with a hefty dose of salt. 



That said, with Apple returning to its traditional September launch timeline, the above dates could easily turn out to be correct. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives has suggested the iPhone will launch in the third week of September, which would be the week of September 13 to 17. Based on past launch events, September 7, September 14, and September 21 are all likely event dates where we could see the new ‌iPhone‌ models unveiled.



The new ‌iPhone 13‌ models will focus heavily on camera capabilities, including ProRes and portrait mode for videos. The new handsets will also include a smaller notch, larger batteries, and improved performance. Apple&#x27;s third-generation ‌AirPods‌ are expected to have a form factor similar to the AirPods Pro, featuring a new case, a shorter stem, and perhaps replaceable ear tips.

In an email to The Seattle Times, the Port of Seattle spokesperson said that the phone was &quot;burned beyond recognition,&quot; but the passenger who owned the device provided details on the model. &quot;We could not confirm it by looking at the remains of the device,&quot; said the spokesperson.



The flight crew extinguished the fire with a battery containment bag, but smoke forced the deployment of the evacuation slides. The smartphone did not catch fire until the flight had landed at the Seattle-Tacoma airport. 128 passengers and six crew member…</span>

Apple, in its iOS 15 beta 7 release notes:
iCloud Private Relay will be released as a public beta to gather additional feedback and improve website compatibility.
[…] It seems like Apple’s slowing this roll-out down, at least in part, because there are lingering compatibility issues with some websites—most notably sites that are displaying the wrong region-specific content, or getting confused when signing in a user. There are some fairly easy remedies web developers can do to make these issues go away, but getting the web to adjust to any new feature takes time, and Apple appears to have erred on the side of caution.
This is what happens in mid-to-late August each year: some features announced at WWDC get postponed for subsequent dot releases throughout…</span>

                    <span>Christine Clarridge, reporting for The Seattle Times:
A passenger’s cellphone caught on fire inside the cabin of an Alaska Airlines flight from New Orleans to Seattle that had landed at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport Monday evening. It was a Samsung Galaxy A21, according to Perry Cooper, a spokesman for the Port of Seattle.
“After much digging, I can tell you that the phone was burned beyond recognition,” Cooper said in an email. “However, during an interview with one of our Port of Seattle Police officers, the passenger volunteered the phone was a Samsung Galaxy A21. Again, we could not confirm it by looking at the remains of the device.”
The crew on Flight 751 extinguished the fire with a battery containment bag, but smoke forced the deployment of evacuation slides, a spokesperson for Alaska Airlines told KOMO-TV.
Good thing no one was hurt. Bad day for Samsung PR. Hope we find out more about exactly how this happened.

Chuck is really changing over the roster, eh?
 The Philadelphia Flyers will just not stop adding some damn dudes to this damn roster!
Announced by the team on Wednesday, they have signed free agent center Derick Brassard to a one-year, $825,000 deal.
OFFICIAL: We&#x27;ve signed forward Derick Brassard to a one-year deal!  ✍️ https://t.co/Qd1YwAFjqA
— Philadelphia Flyers (@NHLFlyers) August 25, 2021



Brassard, 33, is a veteran’s veteran forward, having appeared in a total of 905 NHL games for eight(!) different organizations. Now his ninth in Philadelphia, Brassard is reunited with his former head coach during his time as a member of the New York Rangers, Alain Vigneault. The center played three seasons under Vigneault from the 2013-14 season to his 2015-16 …</span>

He led the team in a major statistical category at just 20 years old.
 Out of every player in the Flyers’ forward group, Joel Farabee took the biggest step forward in 2020-21, and it isn’t even close.



If one considers Farabee’s rookie season a success, comparatively in a year devoid of standout performances, his sophomore season is a highlight. At just twenty years old, playing in the top six, it appears that only the sky is the limit for the Syracuse native. 
By The Numbers


As you can see, Farabee scored 20 goals, which led the Flyers! In fact, he led the NHL in goals among players aged 22 or younger. That’s pretty impressive considering the likes of Brady Tkachuk, Patrik Laine, Martin Necas all populate that list. Farabee is right there a…</span>

It took a minute, but the former first-round pick has established himself firmly as part of the Flyers’ core.
 Teams that win the Stanley Cup always tend to have depth players that prove to be integral along the way, whether or it be during the regular to propel the club in or to get over the hump in the postseason — the Flyers are hoping on Scott Laughton being one of them at some point. 
The 20th overall pick back in the 2012 NHL Entry Draft has had quite the journey towards a regular role in the league, and has put in the work over the years in order to do it. A prime example being the 2016-17 season in which Laughton was essentially told to spend the year in the American Hockey League and remake his game — to focus on transforming hi…</span>

It’s dark and I’m scared of the Philadelphia Flyers Aquaman Jason Momoa.
 It’s raining outside. Dim spotlights cast from street lamps draw circles on the wet pavement of a dark road, leading like markers all the way up to the abandoned house. No one lives there anymore, not since the accident that destroyed lives, families, and an entire town. All that is left is creaking doors and battered floorboards covered in dust.
You step closer to the house. There is a figure. The slow pendulum of light behind it, swaying back and forth, casting shadows across the broken-down porch that only the grimiest of rats call home. Light bouncing through the street and onto your face. Giving you just enough ability to see what is standing in the …</span>

Season 0 includes a new battle pass and a new map
 Splitgate has technically been out for over two years, but its recent move onto console and into open beta has revived the free-to-play shooter, raising its profile on Twitch and elsewhere. In fact, two years after its early access release it’s finally getting new seasons of content. The first season, dubbed season 0, has already started and was announced on Wednesday during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live presentation.  
Splitgate has had battle passes before, but this new opt-in is full of cosmetic items for players to unlock. It’s accompanied by a new patch, which contains with a few much needed balance and quality-of-life tweaks. One thing players will likely notice right away about the cosmetics in that they’r…</span>

The pinnacle PvP mode is getting a major rework
 Destiny’s pinnacle multiplayer experience, Trials, has seen some major issues in Destiny 2. But on Sept. 10, Bungie will upgrade the game mode with a host of changes.
First, Trials of the Osiris won’t be available every weekend anymore. The mode won’t open during the first week of new seasons or before world first raid races. And Trials won’t launch at all on Iron Banner weeks. 
Bungie’s biggest change for the game mode is to matchmaking. Players won’t need to have a three-player team ready in orbit before launching the activity. Starting Sept. 10, players can matchmake with other groups. Bungie will add a solos only “freelance” playlist in the future, which will only match solo players together, just like Iron Banner’…</span>

Combat Evolved
 Splitgate, the new in-beta free-to-play arena shooter from 1047 Games, is what would happen if you stuck Halo 3 and Portal in a blender. The result is a game where no single mechanic feels completely unique, but they all mix together into a fantastic multiplayer offering, and a much-needed update for a very tired genre. 



Splitgate was originally released in early access in 2019 as a fairly barebones version of the game that never really caught on. However, after two years of updates from 1047 Games, the game is now in open beta on PC and consoles. It’s significantly improved, which players have certainly seemed to notice. And with the recent announcement of its first real content season, it seems like Splitgate is going to stick around this ti…</span>

New Saints in a new city return the crime-spree franchise to its 15-year-old origins
 It should come as no surprise that the next Saints Row, launching in February, is a complete reboot of Volition’s open-world crime spree franchise. As fun as it was to make, the studio realized they may have painted themselves into a narrative corner, eight years after the thoroughly surreal Saints Row 4 widened the gangland canon to include an alien invasion, Vice President Keith David, the Dubstep Gun, and the author Jane Austen.
“When we would talk about Saints Row 4, we would talk about how you were coming from the crack house, to the penthouse, to the White House,” Jim Boone, Volition’s chief creative o…</span>

Open beta on PC follows several delays
 Amazon’s New World has been delayed multiple times since 2020, but it appears the Sept. 28 release date announced in August will be the one that sticks. During Gamescom’s Opening Night Live broadcast, Amazon announced the open beta will run Sept. 9-12.
A closed beta was held back in July. Delays for New World began in April 2020, following problems caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. New World is an MMO, for Windows PC, where players colonize a fictional continent somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. Players in groups of 50 or so can battle one another in massive fights.
Amazon Game Studios first announced the game in 2016 at TwitchCon, alongside two other PC games: Breakaway, which was canceled, and Crucible, which was released and then un-released before development was eventually stopped.
Gamescom is ongoing this week, though Microsoft held a pre-show event on Tuesday, where it made announcements regarding Forza Horizon 5, Microsoft Flight Simulator, Xbox Game Pass, and, of course, trebuchets.</span>

King Louie, Baloo, Mowgli, and Shere Khan will get their own bean skins
 Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout showed up at Tuesday’s Gamescom: Opening Night Live event and revealed a bizarre crossover: Disney&#x27;s The Jungle Book skins are coming to Fall Guys. But these skins aren’t modeled after the modern adaptations, they’re pulled, hauntingly, from the animated movie of your childhood. 
Starting in early September, players can pick up skins based on Mowgli, Shere Khan, Baloo, and King Louie. Like all bean skins, The Jungle Book crossover skins feature a top and bottom, with the top featuring full versions of the animated character’s heads. 
King Louie will get his own in-game event from Sept. 3-12 — it’s currently unclear if this event will add any new maps next month. The other The Jungle Book skins will have different availability, which Mediatonic will reveal in a follow-up blog.
The Jungle Book inclusion is all part of Fall Guys season 5’s jungle theme, which launched in July. Players can begin dressing their beans as these iconic characters in just a few weeks.</span>

Up to four players can be terrified at the same time
 Outlast Trials, the third entry in the bloody first-person survival horror game from the team at Red Barrels, revealed its first gameplay trailer on Wednesday. It arrived as part of the Gamescom Opening Night Live streaming event by Geoff Keighley.
The original Outlast was a PlayStation 4 exclusive released in 2013. Its success led to a sequel, Outlast 2, released in 2017. Red Barrels is still in control of the franchise, and has an intimidating new wrinkle for dedicated fans; cooperative multiplayer for up to four players.

“Set in the height of the Cold War era, players take on the role of test subjects abducted by the shadowy Murkoff Corporation,” reads the game’s official description. “Imprisoned in a secret Murkoff facility, players will be thrust into a series of physical and mental ordeals, tormented by iconic characters, and challenged alone or in teams to survive with their sanity intact.”
No release date was announced, and no platforms were mentioned either. You can find out more on the game’s official website.</span>

 The co-creator of Sword &amp; Sworcery, Superbrothers, announced a release date and showed a new trailer for their sci-fi game, Jett: The Far Shore during Gamescom: Opening Night Live on Wednesday. 
Jett: The Far Shore will come to PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Windows PC via the Epic Games Store on Oct. 5. Superbrothers is creating the game in partnership with Pine Scented, and Scntfc is making the score for the game. Pre-orders are going live today. 
Jett: The Far Shore was originally announced in June 2020. Since then, the studio has said that the game would be delayed to 2021. Now we know when it’ll come this fall. 
The game looks like a chilled out space exploration game. You play as Mei, a researcher who is part of a group of aviator scientists who embark on an interstellar trip and arrive on an ocean planet. New footage showed that you’ll be doing plenty of cruising around in your space ship, as well as checking out the planet on foot.</span>

Biking, boarding, and wingsuiting available on PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC
 Riders Republic’s beta is now open to the public on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. The beta runs from Wednesday, Aug. 25 until Saturday, Aug. 28.
Ubisoft presented the game with a two-minute trailer introducing players to Riders Republic, which resembles a Forza Horizon-style racing festival with X-Games-like biking, snowboarding, and wingsuit flying events.
Riders Republic launches Oct. 28, 2021 on the beta platforms, as well as on Google Stadia and Amazon Luna. It was first revealed in September 2020, and originally due in February, but was delayed to this fall in order to deliver “the best fun-fueled experience to our players,” Ubisoft Annecy said at the time. The studio is also the team behind Steep, the 2016 skiing and snowboarding video game.
In Riders Republic, players will ski, snowboard, bike, and glide in “an extreme sports fantasyland” set in virtual versions of U.S. national parks, including Bryce Canyon, Yosemite Valley, Sequoia, Zion, and Mammoth Mountain.</span>

 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge, the new retro beat-’em-up inspired by the classic Konami arcade games, will of course feature Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello on its playable roster. At Gamescom 2021 on Wednesday, developer Tribute Games and publisher Dotemu revealed that intrepid reporter April O’Neil will also kick ass in Shredder’s Revenge.
April will wield her microphone and television camera as deadly weapons in battles against Foot soldiers, but she’s also a capable hand-to-hand martial artist. Some of April’s moves look inspired by another female fighter, Chun-li from Street Fighter and her tenshokyaku rising air kick. “Her agility and far-reaching slide kicks help her close in on targets quickly, and she once again proves the turtles can rely on her unwavering support, even through slices of pizza,” Dotemu said in an official description.
A new trailer for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge also shows off team moves — watch as Leonardo picks April up and turns her into a deadly bowling ball — and the ability to revive teammates with (what else?) a slice of pizza.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge is coming to Nintendo Switch and PC in 2022.</span>

                    <span>Remember Scanwiches? There was even a book version in 2011 and Helen Rosner wrote about the site for Saveur.
To create an image, he simply places half a sandwich on the glass of his Epson V700 scanner. “There’s not a lot of trickery,” says Chonko, who will release a book based on the site in November, with Powerhouse Books. “I try to stay true to the heart and soul of the sandwich. That’s a lofty way to think about it. But then I eat it for lunch.”


The site has stopped publishing new scans, but it’s still good, still delicious. And is a hot dog a scanwich? Apparently so.

                    <span>Only 34 paintings by Dutch master Johannes Vermeer, art history’s foremost painter of Side Views of People Doing Things Near Windows,  have been known to survive to the present day, so when one of them is restored, it’s a big deal. The Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister in Dresden shared the first image of the completed restoration of Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window — and you might notice a pretty big change on the wall behind the girl.
The painting has been in the museum’s collection for more than 250 years and the hidden Cupid had been known about since an x-ray in 1979 and infrared reflectography in 2009. It had been assumed that the artist himself had altered the composition by covering over the painting of Cupid.
But when a major restoration project began in May 2017, conservators discovered that the paint on the wall in the background of the painting, covering the naked Cupid, had in fact been added by another person. When layers of varnish from the 19th century began to be removed from the painting, the conservators discovered that the “solubility properties” of the paint in the central section of the wall were different to those elsewhere in the painting.
Following further investigations, including tests in an archaeometry laboratory, it was discovered that layers of binding agent and a layer of dirt existed between the image of Cupid and the overpainting. The conservators concluded that several decades would have passed between the completion of one layer and the addition of the next and therefore concluded that Vermeer could not have painted over the Cupid himself.


There is a certain aesthetic amenity to the bare wall in the altered version but maaaybe the original Cupid lends the painting some figurative meaning?

                    <span>By making public health central to their health care system, Costa Rica has achieved a higher life expectancy than the US for a fraction of the cost. How did they do it? The New Yorker’s Atul Gawande investigates.
Life expectancy tends to track national income closely. Costa Rica has emerged as an exception. Searching a newer section of the cemetery that afternoon, I found only one grave for a child. Across all age cohorts, the country’s increase in health has far outpaced its increase in wealth. Although Costa Rica’s per-capita income is a sixth that of the United States — and its per-capita health-care costs are a fraction of ours — life expectancy there is approaching eighty-one years. In the United States, life expectancy peaked at just under seventy-nine years, in 2014, and has declin…</span>

                    <span>A criminal from Los Angeles has pled guilty to felony charges after breaking into thousands of iCloud accounts to hunt down nude photos of women, reports The Los Angeles Times.





Hao Kuo Chi collected more than 620,000 private photos and videos by impersonating Apple customer support staff and sending out emails to trick his victims into providing Apple IDs and passwords. Chi used social engineering and phishing schemes to coerce his victims, and he did not breach Apple&#x27;s ‌iCloud‌ protections.



Chi accessed photos and videos from at least 306 victims across the United States, and most of them were young women. Some of the victims were attacked at the request of people that Chi met online after he marketed himself as &quot;icloudripper4you,&quot; a service that could break into ‌iCloud…</span>

                    <span>Hulu this week began implementing HDR, HDR10, HDR10+, and Dolby Vision for some of its original television shows and movies, so Apple TV owners can now watch Hulu content in HDR.





HDR content offers a higher contrast range for more detail, and Hulu TV shows and movies that support HDR content will display an HDR badge on the details page if they are available to stream in HDR.





Hulu&#x27;s HDR content is available on the fifth-generation ‌Apple TV‌ 4K and later, as well as the Chromecast Ultra, Fire TV devices, Roku devices, and Vizio TVs. HDR support is not available on mobile devices at this time.



As noted by CNET, HDR support is limited to Hulu originals, which includes &quot;Handmaid&#x27;s Tale,&quot; &quot;Little Fires Everywhere,&quot; &quot;Nine Perfect Strangers,&quot; &quot;Future Man,&quot; &quot;Castle Rock,&quot; and more.



Hulu appears to be rolling out support for HDR, so not all ‌Apple TV‌ users may see it available immediately.

                    <span>South Korea may soon ban Apple and Google from requiring app developers to use their in-app purchase systems, reports Reuters.





South Korea&#x27;s legislation and judiciary committee is expected to approve an &quot;Anti-Google Law&quot; that amends the existing Telecommunications Business Act. It will require Apple and Google to allow third-party payment methods in their app stores in South Korea, and it will let developers use independent payment systems.



If the amendment is approved by the committee, the National Assembly of South Korea will hold a final vote on Wednesday. Support for the bill has been picking up, and earlier this month, officials in South Korea met with the founder of the Coalition for App Fairness and the senior vice president of Match Group, both vocal anti-Apple cr…</span>

Each year, PCMag sends drivers to traverse thousands of miles of the United States. This year, drivers traveled over 10,000 miles and surveyed network speeds in 30 major metro areas and six rural regions to find the fastest carrier. T-Mobile had the fastest 5G speeds in 24 cities and rural areas, while AT&amp;T won out in eight locations and Verizon won in two.

The account sharing the information goes by UnclePan, who has shared information regarding Apple&#x27;s plans in the past. According to a post from the leaker this week, the upcoming Series 7 will be offered in 41mm and 45mm case sizes. 



Up until the Apple Watch Series 4, Apple had offered 38mm and 42mm case sizes.

                    <span>In late April, Spotify began testing a Podcast Subscriptions program as a way for creators to offer paid subscriber-only content to listeners, and today the streaming music service announced this monetization option is now available to all U.S. creators. Spotify said creators can mark episodes as subscriber-only and publish them to Spotify and other platforms through its podcast creation platform Anchor.





Spotify also announced that it plans to expand the Podcast Subscriptions program internationally starting September 15 of this year.



Spotify said its model is built to maximize revenue for creators, who will receive 100% of subscription revenue minus payment processing fees until 2023, when the company plans to implement a 5% fee on subscription revenue.



Two changes are being made to the program to benefit creators: additional pricing tiers for subscription fees and the option to download a list of email addresses for subscribers so creators can further engage with their audiences.



Apple rolled out its own Podcasts Subscriptions feature worldwide in June, with the company receiving 30% of a subscriber&#x27;s revenue in the first year and 15% if they remain subscribed for longer than one year. Creators are also required to enroll in the Apple Podcasters Program for $19.99 per year in order to offer subscriptions.



Benefits of Apple Podcasts Subscriptions for creators include the ability to offer subscriptions for individual shows or for groups of shows through a &quot;channels&quot; feature, the choice to offer fully paid subscriptions or freemium subscriptions with a mix of free and paid episodes, and availability in over 170 countries and regions today. Apple Podcasts Subscriptions also has options for soliciting subscriber email addresses.

                    <span>On this day ten years ago, Steve Jobs resigned as CEO of the company he built and officially named Tim Cook as Apple&#x27;s new head. Two months later, Steve Jobs passed away and the future of Apple lay solely on the shoulders of Tim Cook.





‌Tim Cook‌ took over Apple at a turbulent time when Jobs was battling pancreatic cancer and the company&#x27;s future seemed uncertain. Questions were widespread after ‌Tim Cook‌ took over, including whether Cook would continue in the footsteps of Jobs or create a new vision for the future of Apple.



A day after he became CEO, Cook sent a letter to Apple employees, promising that despite Jobs no longer being at the helm, Apple &quot;is not going to change.&quot;

The leaker shared the information on Twitter, explaining that both of the upcoming MacBook Pro models, expected to come in 14 and 16-inch sizes, will feature the same performance due to having the same &quot;M1X&quot; chip.



Currently, the 16-inch MacBook Pro offers a significant performance improvement over the high-end 13-inch models due to its more powerful Intel chips and better thermals, so bringing the two model sizes to parity could be a major boost for owners of the smaller, more portable model.

With a price tag said to be $179, the Fitbit Charge 5 will be $50 more expensive than the current Charge 4, but there are some obvious hardware changes on the way that have more in common with the Fitbit luxe, not least being a full-color rounded display that traces the curve of the ergonomic wrist strap.



The images suggest the device will have capacitive touch areas on the sides, and according to the leaked video, the Charge 5 will additionally have built-in GPS and ECG sensors, as well as an electrodermal activity (EDA) sensor that claims to track your stress levels.



The EDA sensor plays into the company&#x27;s Daily Readiness Score, which is a subscriber-only Fitbit Premium feature ($10 per month or $80 per year). The score is based on your exercise history, sleep, and heart rate, and is used to recommend what exercise routine you should undertake each day.

Every device purchased comes with a six-month trial of Fitbit Premium, which is clearly competing with Apple Watch and its Apple Fitness+ integration, with guided workouts and programs on offer on top of sleep tools and other health insights.



The Fitbit Charge will be available in at least three colors, and there&#x27;s no word on the specific release date for the fitness tracker-cum-smartwatch, but Google is likely to place it strategically around the launch of the Apple Watch Series 7 that&#x27;s expected to be announced in the next month or so.

Season of the Lost adds a handful of new Exotics for Guardians
 Another Destiny 2 season is here, and that means more Exotics for Guardians to get their hands on. With Season of the Lost, players can expect the usual seasonal Exotic weapon, one Exotic armor piece per class, and more. Season of the Lost has at least one bonus Exotic quest. 
However, we don’t know everything about the Exotics coming this season. Bungie has officially revealed four through the in-game collection, but it’s hiding one more. Here’s a look at the four Exotics we know about, and everything we know about the fifth. As in past seasons, players can get the new Armor Exotics by soloing Master or Legend Lost Sectors.

No glasses needed for this nifty, forced-perspective rendering
 Some of the greatest games take the novel experiences of real life and translate them into a cunning virtual experience. For example, this train building game by James Vanas is reminiscent of the feeling of holding one of those plastic 3D bookmarks sold in tchotchke tourist shops. As you tilt it, the game moves like a holographic card.

Microsoft offers updates on Forza Horizon 5, Flight Simulator, and more
 Microsoft gave Xbox fans an end-of-summer update at Gamescom 2021 on Tuesday, revealing new details about upcoming games like Forza Horizon 5 and Age of Empires 4, as well as released (or soon-to-be-released) games like Microsoft Flight Simulator and Psychonauts 2. If you didn’t catch the nearly-90-minute stream, we’ve got a quick rundown of what’s new in the world of Xbox and PC gaming.
But before you start scrolling, we’ll set an important expectation: Xbox Game Studios and 343 Industries did not announce a final release date for Halo Infinite at Gamescom. That game is still slated to hit Xbox consoles and PC sometime this holiday season.
The Xbox team will have more to share on Wednesday, Aug. 25, at Gamescom Opening Night Live, the pre-show event hosted by Geoff Keighley. This post will be updated with whatever Microsoft and Xbox Game Studios has left to announced at Gamescom 2021 later this week.</span>

Procedural storytelling meets player narrative in one of the year’s best games
 Wildermyth clicked for me when my greatest warrior’s human head was transformed into the head of a raven. She had just spent an evening sassing a woman cloaked in black, making fun of her mystical ways, and when that woman turned into a flock of crows the next day, my warrior’s life was never the same. She went on to slay a bunch of constructs made from cogwheels and bones by ripping at their armor with her razor-sharp beak. She entered into myth as a part-woman, part-bird, and all-powerful ass-kicking hero who bought the land a hundred years of peace. 



That story wasn’t fully written by the devs of Wildermyth. There is no warrior-bird hero questline in the game. The random…</span>

Age of Empires 4’s memeable siege unit gets some love in ‘Hands on History’
 Trebuchets — “the ultimate medieval siege weapon,” not the sans-serif typeface created by Microsoft — are coming to Age of Empires 4 and players will be able to learn all about them in the game’s “Hands on History” segments,  developers World’s Edge and Relic Entertainment announced at Gamescom 2021 on Tuesday. Adam Isgreen, creative director at World’s Edge, offered a (very) deep dive into the fan-favorite, highly memed trebuchet during Xbox’s Gamescom stream, as a way to teach players about medieval history.


Age of Empires 4 will include 28 unlockable Hands on History videos, each of which was “filmed on location with experts around the world.” In the case of ye olde trebuchet, mechanical engineer Dr. Shini Somara explained how the don’t-call-it-a-catapult works at Warwick Castle in England during a three-minute-long segment shown at Tuesday’s livestream.
World’s Edge and Relic showed off the Age of Empires 4 trebuchet in action in-game last week, in a trailer that offers a short but satisfying burst of projectile lobbing and castle sieging.


They’ve also shown off other weapons of war coming to Age of Empires 4, including the Nest of Bees, which I only learned about today and was crestfallen to discover does not shoot actual bees.
Age of Empires 4 launches on Oct. 28, on Windows PC via Steam and the Windows Store. It will be available for Xbox Game Pass for PC on launch day.</span>

Season of the Lost will lead straight into The Witch Queen
 Destiny 2’s latest season, Season of the Lost, is here, and it’ll need to keep Guardians occupied for the next six months. Season of the Lost is the final season ahead of Destiny 2’s The Witch Queen expansion, which Bungie revealed alongside Season of the Lost on Tuesday. 
For players concerned about a content drought, Season of the Lost promises some major changes to Destiny 2. Players will finally get their hands on cross play, anti cheat, a Trials of Osiris rework, and dozens of key balance changes. All of that also comes with the usual salvo of seasonal content. 
Here’s a look at the content and updates coming in Season of the Lost. For the complete patch notes, scroll down.…</span>

Nothing’s stopping you from driving the Mercedes-AMG One in the jungle, Playground Games says
 Playground Games revealed Forza Horizon 5’s opening sequence of cinematics and gameplay Tuesday afternoon at Xbox’s Gamescom 2021 showcase, highlighting the varied terrain, weather, and biomes players will encounter on the racing game’s wide-open map of Mexico when it launches in November.
“I think our campaign learns a lot from Horizon 4’s campaign,” Mike Brown, Forza Horizon 5’s creative director, told media in a briefing event last week. The sequence shown at Gamescom bridges the ending of Forza Horizon 4 with the beginning of the latest racing festival. “There are all of these things that you can work towards, but in a way that feels more str…</span>

Destiny will finally get a weapon crafting system as well
 Players finally know what to expect with Destiny 2: The Witch Queen, the game’s fourth expansion, thanks to Bungie’s Destiny Showcase on Tuesday. The studio revealed a host of details around the major update, including the addition of weapon crafting and a new weapon type: the Glaive.
The Glaive is a kind of spear or polearm in Destiny 2, with a long, curved blade on the end. It’s the series second bladed melee weapon, after Bungie added swords in The Taken King, but it’s the first melee weapon that keeps Guardians in first-person. Glaives, like swords,  will have melee combos, but unlike swords, they’re energy weapons and don’t sit in the heavy slot. But players can also launch projectiles with them.
The Witch Queen also introduces Destiny 2’s first real weapon crafting system, although Bungie has fiddled with the idea in past seasons like with The Menagerie’s Chalice of Opulence mechanic. Bungie says this new mechanic will let players “craft the perfect roll,” and combine unique mods with advanced stats. It seems like it should allow players to find the weapons they’re looking for more easily.
The studio isn’t revealing much about the system just yet, but it’s the only way players can unlock the new Glaive. Guardians will be able to craft weapons from The Witch Queen at launch, with even more weapons coming later in 2022.
The Witch Queen expansion takes players to meet Savathun — the titular Witch Queen and sister of Oryx from Destiny’s The Taken King expansion. Players will adventure into her Throneworld to discover how Savathun and her brood of Hive began wielding their own Ghosts and the Light powers that come with them.</span>

The power is in your palms
 The Xbox Gamescom presentation on Tuesday showed off indie titles heading to Xbox Games Pass, but one of them stood out from the bunch. Into the Pit is a fast-paced game that pulls off retro graphics and gameplay. It’s Doom, but you’re a wizard casting spells and firing off magical bolts instead of firing a gun. 
In Into the Pit, you play a member of a family of mystics. Your cousin has gone missing, and it probably has something to do with the demonic pit she uncovered in her search for occult power. From there, the player has to run through a roguelite dungeon, mixing and matching runes and spells to become better at killing demons.
Into the Pit is set to release on PC and Xbox One on Oct. 19, which makes it a perfect pre-Halloween experience for those who enjoy old school FPS gameplay. The game will be available on Xbox Game Pass at launch.</span>

Microsoft says Xbox One will be able to stream Xbox Series X games
 Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers can cloud-stream games on both Xbox Series X and Xbox One this holiday season, Microsoft announced Tuesday during Gamescom 2021.

                    <span>You might want to take a deep breath or do a couple of laps around the house before watching this video about a community in the Ozarks with a very low Covid-19 vaccination rate. Here’s a sample. An ICU patient wearing an oxygen mask on why he didn’t get vaccinated:
I’m more of a libertarian and I don’t like being told what I have to do. I’m still not completely 100% sold on the inoculation.


Video narrator:
It was eerie to hear Christopher insist on his individual freedoms even as he struggled to breathe.


Can you hear me screaming all the way from my desk to wherever you are? I don’t like being told what I have to do?! Fucking hell. And this:
There’s no better place to see the impact of this political rhetoric than in the hospital. Only about 50 percent of the staff are vaccinated. None of the unvaccinated staffers were willing to talk.


Absolutely maddening. I want off this ride.

Instead it was a year in limbo: school on stuttering Zoom, school in person and then back home again for quarantine, school all the time and none of the time. No part of it was good, for kids or parents, but most parts of it were safe, and somehow, impossibly, we made it through a full year. It was hell, but we did it. We did it.
Time collapsed and it was summer again, and, briefly, things looked better. We began to dream of normalcy, of trips and jobs and school. But 2021’s hot vax summer only truly delivered on the hot part, as vaccination rates slowed and the Delta variant cut through some …</span>

                    <span>I love this post from the NYPL comparing astronomical drawings by E.L. Trouvelot done in the 1870s to contemporary NASA images.
Trouvelot was a French immigrant to the US in the 1800s, and his job was to create sketches of astronomical observations at Harvard College’s observatory. Building off of this sketch work, Trouvelot decided to do large pastel drawings of “the celestial phenomena as they appear…through the great modern telescopes.”


He made drawings of Saturn, Jupiter, aurora borealis, the Milky Way, and more. Here’s his incredible drawing of sun spots compared to a recent image of the Sun’s surface:


And his drawing of a solar eclipse compared to a recent image:


Check out the post for more examples of Trouvelot’s work.

                    <span>Apple CEO Tim Cook is set to join other tech executives in a cybersecurity meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden next week, reports Bloomberg.





The meeting will focus on the efforts by private companies to improve cybersecurity following a surge in online attacks over the course of the last year, an official familiar with the event told Bloomberg.
The executives could discuss efforts undertaken by critical infrastructure entities, including those in the banking, energy and water utility sectors, to improve cybersecurity and collaborations with the government. The tech executives are likely to discuss how software can drive better security in the supply chain, the senior official said.
The meeting will include Cook and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, with executives from Google, Amazon, IBM, Southern Co., and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co also invited to attend.

                    <span>Facebook is re-adding voice and video calling features to its main Facebook app after moving the features to Messenger back in 2014, reports Bloomberg.





Users in some countries including the United States are now able to make voice or video calls directly from the Facebook app. As of now, Facebook is testing the feature, which is meant to cut down on the number of times that Facebook users need to swap over to the Messenger app.



Messenger and Facebook used to be a single app, but in 2014, Facebook split them into separate apps and removed Messenger functionality from Facebook. Customers were forced to download the Messenger app to send private messages to other Facebook users or to make phone calls using the Facebook platform.

                    <span>Apple appears to be expanding on the native Apple Maps review functionality that it first introduced in iOS 14, allowing ‌Apple Maps‌ users in the United States the option to review places of interest, restaurants, and other locations.





In the ‌Apple Maps‌ app in ‌iOS 14‌ and iOS 15, U.S. users can now see an option to provide a thumbs up or thumbs down for most locations. Tapping on the thumbs up/down icon brings up a secondary interface for providing thumbs up and thumbs down ratings for various categories like products, customer service, food, atmosphere, and more, based on the location being reviewed.



Users also have the option to upload photos of the location to the ‌Apple Maps‌ app to be added to the maps listing.





At the current time, the ‌Apple Maps‌ native rating system is displayed alongside the Yelp ratings that are provided for various locations. Apple may eventually be planning to replace Yelp and TripAdvisor integrations, but will need to build up a database of ratings before that will be possible.



There are no options for written reviews at this time, however, so it is not clear if Apple plans to entirely replace Yelp.



Native rating options in the ‌Apple Maps‌ app appear to be new for users in the United States, but Apple has been testing the feature in other countries like the UK and Australia for some time now. Ratings may also be available in additional countries based on the Ratings and Photos Terms legal site for Maps that was shared on Reddit.

                    <span>Pop star and actress Olivia Rodrigo today released the music video for her song &quot;brutal,&quot; off of her debut album &quot;SOUR&quot;. For the video, Rodrigo partnered up with Apple to create a suite of augmented reality face masks using an iPad Pro.







Alongside the release of the music video, Rodrigo shared a few clips on Instagram that showcased her editing the AR face masks using an ‌iPad Pro‌ and an Apple Pencil. The face masks can be seen throughout the video, and include effects like drooping tears made of fire, rainbow hearts, a robot mask, and much more.








Interscope Records, which is Rodrigo&#x27;s label, has a history of using Apple to promote many of its artists. This includes Lady Gaga and Selena Gomez, both of which had music videos shot on iPhone in recent years, and Billie Eilish, whose documentary &quot;The World&#x27;s A Little Blurry&quot; debuted on Apple TV+ earlier this summer.

                    <span>Upcoming Apple TV+ movie &quot;The Tragedy of Macbeth&quot; is set to premiere at the BFI London Film Festival on the final day of the event, Sunday, October 17.





Apple also plans to offer preview screenings of the film at London Film Festival partner cinemas across the UK.



Written by Joel Coen, &quot;The Tragedy of Macbeth&quot; is set to star Denzel Washington and Frances McDormand. Filmed entirely in black and white, the movie is described as a &quot;bold and fierce adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s classic, a tale of murder, madness, ambition, and wrathful cunning.&quot;



&quot;The Tragedy of Macbeth&quot; is the first film directed by a single Coen brother. Joel Coen and his brother Ethan Coen have been responsible for hit movies that include &quot;The Big Lebowski,&quot; &quot;No Country for Old Men,&quot; &quot;Fargo,&quot; and &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot;



Apple announced that it had acquired the rights to the movie back in May, and the film is being produced by Apple partner A24. Apple has previously worked with A24 on &quot;On the Rocks,&quot; starring Bill Murray and Rashida Jones.



After premiering in theaters, &quot;The Tragedy of Macbeth&quot; will be available on ‌Apple TV+‌, but Apple has not yet provided a date for its availability.

                    <span>Apple has today shared a trailer for the second season of &quot;The Morning Show&quot; and highlighted the impending return of the award-winning Apple Original drama series.






The second season of the show will feature ten episodes, and continues to star Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, who also serve as executive producers. Other returning cast members include Steve Carell, Billy Crudup, Mark Duplass, Nestor Carbonell, Karen Pittman, Bel Powley, Desean Terry, Janina Gavankar, Tom Irwin, and Marcia Gay Harden. 



The Morning Show was one of Apple TV+&#x27;s flagship original shows when the video streaming service launched in late 2019. Apple describes the second season as follows:
Picking up after the explosive events of season one, season two finds &quot;The Morning Show&quot; team emerging from the wreckage of Alex (Aniston) and Bradley&#x27;s (Witherspoon) actions, to a new UBA and a world in flux, where identity is everything and the chasm between who we present as and who we really are comes into play.




The first episode of the second season of The Morning Show will debut on Friday, September 17 exclusively on ‌Apple TV+‌, followed by one new episode weekly, every Friday. The complete first season is available to watch now.

                    <span>In the latest episode of hit Apple TV+ comedy series &quot;Ted Lasso,&quot; Jeremy Swift&#x27;s character Higgins briefly poked fun at actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney purchasing Welsh soccer club Wrexham AFC last year.





As noted by Deadline, Reynolds and McElhenney responded over the weekend by tweeting a letter that sarcastically threatens legal action against Apple TV+ over the joke. 



&quot;While we hold the incomparable Jeremy Swift in no ill regard and are honored to be mentioned on the platform that&#x27;s brought us high-quality programming ranging from Mythic Quest season one to Mythic Quest season two, we must insist that you cease and desist from the casting of any doubt regarding our commitment to the club, the fans and the entire Wrexham community,&quot; the letter reads in part.

                    <span>T-Mobile today announced that new and existing Magenta and Magenta MAX customers can receive 12 months of Apple TV+ for free starting this Wednesday, August 25 in the United States. T-Mobile has launched a promotional page with further details.

                    <span>Apple today announced that it will make an unspecified donation to the National Park Foundation for each qualifying Apple Pay purchase at an Apple Store, on Apple.com, or in the Apple Store app in the United States from August 23 through August 29.





The promotion is limited to the first 100,000 transactions and it is subject to a $10 minimum purchase with Apple Pay, according to fine print on Apple&#x27;s website.



This is at least the fifth consecutive year that Apple has ran this promotion in support of the National Park Foundation, the official charitable partner of the National Park Service in the United States. Apple CEO Cook has expressed his appreciation for national parks, and in an interview last year he said that Apple Park has conference rooms named after U.S. national parks, such as the Grand Canyon room near his personal office.



On August 25, all U.S. national parks that charge an entrance fee will offer free admission in celebration of the National Park Service&#x27;s birthday. On August 28, Apple Watch users around the world can earn an Activity Challenge award themed after national parks by completing a hike, walk, run, or wheelchair workout of a mile (1.6km) or longer.

                    <span>Despite having tested and worked on the technology, Apple has decided not to include an under-screen Touch ID sensor with the upcoming iPhone 13, continuing to leave customers with Face ID as the only biometric authentication option for the iPhone.





Apple had been testing ‌Touch ID‌ technology that would have allowed the company to place the sensor under the display on the ‌iPhone‌, allowing users to simply put their finger on the display to authenticate. While Apple regularly tests and researches new ideas and technologies, reports earlier in the year had suggested the company was on track to include ‌Touch ID‌ under the display with the 2021 iPhones.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(8 min)</span>
                    <span>Effective next year, pricing for all commercial plans of Microsoft 365 will be increased as a way to compensate for the &quot;increased value&quot; Microsoft&#x27;s suite of tools has provided to customers over the last ten years, Microsoft has announced.





In a blog post late last week, the company says the new changes are the first time it has substantively increased the price of Office 365 since it launched a decade ago. Microsoft notes some of the ways that Microsoft 365 has grown in prominence over the last year, including that it has added 24 different apps to its suite of tools. 

Since its launch a decade ago, Office 365 has grown to over 300 million commercial paid seats. Along the way, we have continuously re-invested to meet the changing needs of our customers. Four years ago, we introduced Microsoft 365 to bring together the best of Office, Windows, and Enterprise Mobility and Security (EMS). That same year we added Microsoft Teams as the only integrated solution where you can meet, chat, call, collaborate, and automate business processes—right in the flow of work.



In fact, since introducing Microsoft 365 we have added 24 apps to the suites—Microsoft Teams, Power Apps, Power BI, Power Automate, Stream, Planner, Visio, OneDrive, Yammer, and Whiteboard—and have released over 1,400 new features and capabilities in three key areas.
The pricing increases are small, consisting of only $2-$4 hikes, and are as followed:

Microsoft 365 Business Basic (from $5 to $6 per user), Microsoft 365 Business Premium (from $20 to $22), Office 365 E1 (from $8 to $10), Office 365 E3 (from $20 to $23), Office 365 E5 (from $35 to $38), and Microsoft 365 E3 (from $32 to $36).
All of the changes will apply globally on March 1, 2022.

As noted by PCGamer, E2M6, the Dismal Oubliette, has now been fully restored. Quick […]</span>

                    <span>Jacqueline Howard, reporting for CNN:
The US Food and Drug Administration on Monday granted full approval to the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine for people age 16 and older. This is the first coronavirus vaccine approved by the FDA, and is expected to open the door to more vaccine mandates.
Way more mandates. Mandate vaccinated status for everything. School, air travel, train travel, restaurants, stores. Everything. Get vaccinated or stay home.
The vaccine will be marketed as Comirnaty, the FDA said in its announcement on Monday.
I don’t care what they call it, but that’s a bad name. Looks like someone spilled a drink on the keyboard while trying to type “Cormac McCarthy”.
(Moderna has secured “Spikevax” for their vaccine, an excellent name.)

Get it? Because he’s from Austria? Please laugh.
 After heading to Dallas in free agency in search of winning a Stanley Cup, Michael Raffl leaves behind an interesting legacy after eight seasons as a Flyer. The non-Swiss army knife and longtime bottom six presence initially departed at the trade deadline, heading to Washington in exchange for a fifth round pick in 2021 that became Ty Murchison.



While many would (fairly or unfairly) tag him as a career just-a-guy, it’s important to remember that Raffl was, at one point, a very effective NHLer. Unfortunately for him and fans of the Orange &amp; Black, that wasn’t the case in 2020-21. Let’s look at why.

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *In case you forgot, development camp starts this week! The end of this week, but still. This week. Hockey players, on ice, in Voorhees. [Flyers]
*Big news over the weekend though was the Flyers getting a deal done with Travis Sanheim, without the help of the arbiter. [BSH]
*He got a raise, of course, because that’s how these things work. [Inquirer]
*They also locked up Connor Bunnaman. So that’s cool and good. [BSH]

Crispy Prosciutto, Sage Pesto, and Tomato Grilled Cheese…all the flavors we love in a bowl of really good tomato soup…but in the form of grilled cheese. Summer tomatoes and crispy prosciutto layered between two slices of bread with fresh sage, basil pesto, melty fontina, and mozzarella cheese. This sandwich is coated in parmesan sage butter,…

Some say the nerfs don’t go far enough, others wonder why a nerfed Seer is even worth having in the game
 Apex Legends’ latest update got players’ hopes up with news of a nerf to the shooter’s newest character, Seer, but the changes don’t go far enough on the newest Legend’s most disruptive ability.
The nerf takes out both the damage and the half-second, screen-blinding flash that opponents suffer when they’re hit with Seer’s “Focus of Attention” Tactical ability. But it still interrupts enemies who are healing themselves or reviving teammates. So Seer can continue playing havoc with opponents’ last-ditch defensive moves, much as the character has done since being introduced three weeks ago.

Mojang and Xbox Game Studios will bring the game to Valve’s store
 Minecraft Dungeons, the dungeon crawler inspired by Mojang’s classic survival game, is coming to Steam on Sept. 22. 
The base game will be available for purchase for $19.99 and the Ultimate Edition, which includes the base game along with all six DLCs, will cost $39.99. Currently, the Windows PC version game is available for purchase on the Microsoft Store.
Minecraft Dungeons is a top-down action RPG game where you explore procedurally generated dungeons. (Think, Diablo but for kids.) Since its release in May 2020, Mojang and Xbox Game Studios have continued to release DLC that expands on the core game and bring new dungeons to explore. 
Three additional battle passes for the game — the Hero Edition, Hero Pass, and Season Pass — will be discounted from digital sales from Aug. 31 and will only be available in retail stores until stock runs out. Mojang and Xbox Games Studios said in a news release, “Players will still be able to purchase the same DLCs and in-game content, which will be available as part of the Standard Edition (game only) and Ultimate Edition (game and all six DLCs).”
Now, it’ll all come to Steam and give folks another way to purchase the game. Minecraft Dungeons is out now on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.</span>

The alpha will be for PlayStation players only
 The latest Call of Duty won’t be released until November, but PlayStation players will have a chance to check the game out early during a multiplayer alpha for the game’s new Champion Hill mode. Call of Duty: Vanguard’s alpha will begin on Aug. 27 at 1 p.m. ET and end on Aug. 29 at 1 p.m. ET.
The alpha will focus on Vanguard’s new Champion Hill mode, in which duo (2v2) or trio (3v3) squads compete against each other in a round-robin tournament. Each team has individual lives that carry over from match to match, but when your team’s lives hit zero, you’re out. The last team standing wins. 
The mode also features an economy system that’s fairly new to the franchise. Every player in Champion Hill wil…</span>

A Left 4 Dead-alike that can’t blaze its own trail
 Before jumping into the second mission in Aliens: Fireteam Elite, I activated a challenge card that guaranteed a special alien to appear at least once. In exchange, this granted an XP multiplier — unfortunately, I had misread the second half of this mutator. Every 10 to 15 seconds the Drone, a Xenomorph with the ability to pin you down à la the Hunter in Left 4 Dead, appeared and terrorized my squad. It was so ridiculous that it became a running joke until we inevitably failed the mission. But in retrospect, this high risk/high reward situation made for a memorable moment, and I wish Aliens: Fireteam Elite was filled with more of them throughout.

                    <span>A Freudian adventure full of warmth, compassion, and humor
 Psychonauts 2 begins with the camera sweeping over the textured contours of a giant brain. At this scale, the complex organ looks topographical — every curve a hill in the landscape of the mind. The image reminded me of one of the more common editions of Sigmund Freud’s landmark The Interpretation of Dreams. The cover image depicted a pastoral scene of rolling green hills. Or was it a lady lying down, her back to us? Or a great bull dozing among the gentle slopes? The idea here, I gather, is that dreams and the unconscious mind in general, work metaphorically. Things are rarely as they seem, and one thing often stands in for another.



Of course, Freud and his psychoanalytic techniques have a troubled history. It turns out, when …</span>

                    <span>We&#x27;re rapidly approaching Apple&#x27;s busy product launch season, and rumors are continuing to fly. It sounds like Apple has enough products in the pipeline that it&#x27;ll need to hold multiple virtual events before the end of the year to introduce them all, so get ready for a flurry of activity over the next few months.







Other news this week included a fresh round of betas for iOS 15 and most of the associated operating system updates, reducing the update interval to one week as Apple finalizes things ahead of an expected September public launch. We also saw an interesting story of a &quot;double agent&quot; in the Apple leaker community, confirmation of a never-released &quot;iPhone nano&quot; thanks to an old email from Steve Jobs, and more.

Finally, no more uncertainty.
 After a long, arduous battle over the stipulations of his new contract this offseason, Travis Sanheim finally agreed to a new contract with the Flyers: two years at a $4.675 million AAV. This represents a slight, but not enormous pay raise for Sanheim, which will certainly be a polarizing outcome within the eyes of the fanbase. Still, the price and term is around what most models projected the still-young defender to receive. Evolving-Hockey.com’s contract projections pegged Sanheim at two years for $4.303 million AAV, which isn’t too far off from what the Flyers ended up paying.


Sanheim is coming off of a season where he had awful on-ice results despite solid underlying numbers. Costly mistakes and strong analytics have been staples of the big blue liner’s career in Philadelphia, making him an interesting case for arbitration. Looking at the whole of Sanheim’s work in the NHL within the context of an advanced metrics-driven perspective would likely argue that he’s worth more than the deal he was signed to.

      Sanheim’s three year player card.
  
The Flyers now technically have -$643,523 in cap space, but are fine due to the ability to exceed the salary cap by ten percent in the offseason. However, it does put them in a precarious position when it comes to running a 23-man roster as opposed to just 22:
Barring a trade or reworking of the roster, it now looks like the Flyers are going to roll with a 22-man roster to start the year. That&#x27;s the only way they can fit everyone under the $81.5 million cap ceiling, to my eyes. Can&#x27;t fit 23 without moving somebody out.
— Charlie O&#x27;Connor (@charlieo_conn) August 21, 2021



With the season just 55 days away, signing Sanheim solidifies the outlook of the roster heading into 2021-22.</span>

Bungie won’t separate Destiny 2’s two main modes, and it’s starting to create problems
 Since the launch of Destiny 2, Bungie has struggled to maintain the balance between its PvE and PvP communities. The two camps have argued for years about whether Destiny should just be a PvE game or if it truly has room for competitive offerings. In the process, every player has lost out. Every time Bungie tries to make a new addition to the cooperative game, it’s hamstrung by multiplayer balancing — and vice versa.
Bungie’s devotion to both sides of the Destiny coin, while admirable, has resulted in an identity crisis. The studio likely won’t ever separate its PvP Crucible from its PvE cooperative activities. But if anything is clear, it’s that current attempts toward harmony a…</span>

                    <span>Apple in 2020 acquired popular weather app Dark Sky, and in iOS 15 some of those Dark Sky features have been incorporated into the official app. Apple&#x27;s Weather app has received a major design overhaul in ‌iOS 15‌, making it a much better weather resource.





Design Overhaul


The Weather app in ‌iOS 15‌ has an updated design that makes it easier than ever to see the information that you want to know at a glance. The Weather app adopts the card-style interface that&#x27;s also been used for the Settings app, separating different information into sections.





There continues to be a main view with the weather conditions on an hourly basis that you can shift through, and a new 10-day forecast view lets you know what weather you can expect in the future. The updated 10-day foreca…</span>

                    <span>Highly anticipated game Tetris Beat today launched on Apple Arcade, offering up classic block-stacking Tetris gameplay merged with music and rhythm mechanics.





Players are tasked with rotating and dropping Tetriminos in time with the beat in Drop mode, keeping to the rhythm to build combo chains. Those who want a more casual gameplay experience can try out Tap mode, while Tetris fans who want a traditional gameplay experience are able to use Marathon mode, which offers a selection of soundtracks.



Tetris Beat features music from a diverse set of artists including Alison Wonderland, GARZA (of Thievery Corporation), Hannah Diamond, Octo Octa, Dauwd, CINTHIE, and more. There are 18 exclusive songs that span the dance, hip hop, and pop genres, with new music set to be introduced each month.



Apple adds new games to ‌Apple Arcade‌ on a regular basis, and earlier this month, surpassed 200 available titles. ‌Apple Arcade‌ games include no in-app purchase options or ads, with the service priced at $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year for the whole family.



‌‌Apple Arcade‌‌ titles can be played on iPhones, iPads, Macs, and Apple TVs, and many games are designed to support controllers, with support available for PlayStation and Xbox controllers. The service is available in more than 150 countries.



‌Apple Arcade‌ subscribers can download Tetris Beat for free. [Direct Link]

                    <span>An Apple II manual signed by Steve Jobs and Mike Markkula sold for $787,484 at auction this month after garnering 46 bids.





The 196 page manual was addressed to Julian Brewer, the son of Michael Brewer. Michael Brewer negotiated distribution rights for Apple in the UK in 1979, and the manual had a personal message inside. &quot;Julian, your generation is the first to grow up with computers. Go change the world! Steven Jobs, 1980,&quot; read Jobs&#x27; note.
Julian recalls, &quot;I was sitting in my bedroom writing games on my Apple II when Dad called me down to meet some guests. To my amazement it was Steve Jobs and Mike Markkula. I had the manual with me and only later understood how rare it was for Jobs to sign anything, let alone to write an inscription like this. He got on well with Dad, so I feel the inscription was made with care.&quot;
RR Auctions, the site that sold the Apple II manual, also auctioned off other Steve Jobs memorabilia that fetched high prices. A Steve Jobs&#x27; letter that said &quot;I&#x27;m afraid I don&#x27;t sign autographs&quot; sold for $479,939, and a NeXTSTEP software package sold for $210,325.





A functional Apple-1 computer previously owned by Roger Wagner fetched $464,876, which is less than some prior Apple-1 computers have sold for. A signed 128K Macintosh Motherboard sold for $132,049, and an Apple Lisa Computer sold for $94,949.





A copy of Macworld #1 that was signed by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak sold for $201,021, and a leather bomber jacket that was worn by Jobs in the 1983 &quot;middle finger to IBM&quot; photo sold for $66,466.

At the time, T-Mobile said that data from 7.8 million current customers had been compromised, as well as information from 40 million former or potential customers. In an updated statement provided today, T-Mobile says that it has confirmed that data from another 5.3 million postpaid customers was accessed.



Information accessed from these customers included names, addresses, birth dates, phone numbers, IMEIs, and IMSIs. The prior 7.8 million customers also saw their SSN and driver&#x27;s license information stolen.

                    <span>Documents highlighted by The Verge and disclosed as part of the Apple vs. Epic Games trial have revealed that Apple discussed plans for sideloading apps, sought to lock users into its ecosystem using gift cards, attempted to tackle chaos in the App Store review process, and more.





Several of the internal documents related to internal discussions around the possibility of sideloading iPhone apps outside of the ‌App Store‌. Some of these discussions may have gone further than expected, since in 2008, software chief Scott Forstall asked Steve Jobs what text should appear to iOS users when they want to open a sideloaded app. Jobs agreed to the following alert: &quot;Are you sure you want to open the application &#x27;Monkey Ball&#x27; from the developer &#x27;Sega&#x27;?&quot;

Apple has begun promoting and posting Today at Apple sessions on YouTube due to the global health crisis. The company was planning to bring back its session to its in-person retail stores at the end of this month; however, it has since decided differently due to the health crisis. The sessions cover photography, art, design, video, coding, music, and more using Apple products and accessories like the ‌‌iPhone‌‌, iPad, Mac, and Apple Pencil.

                    <span>Respected university researchers are sounding the alarm bells over the technology behind Apple&#x27;s plans to scan iPhone users&#x27; photo libraries for CSAM, or child sexual abuse material, calling the technology &quot;dangerous.&quot;





Jonanath Mayer, an assistant professor of computer science and public affairs at Princeton University, as well as Anunay Kulshrestha, a researcher at Princeton University Center for Information Technology Policy, both penned an op-ed for The Washington Post, outlining their experiences with building image detection technology.



The researchers started a project two years ago to identity CSAM in end-to-end encrypted online services. The researchers note that given their field, they &quot;know the value of end-to-end encryption, which protects data from third-party…</span>

                    <span>Apple recently launched an invite-only iOS app called &quot;Siri Speech Study&quot; to improve and provide feedback on the Siri voice assistant, it has emerged (via TechCrunch).





The app, which first appeared on the App Store on August 9 without fanfare and was updated on August 18, allows users to voluntarily share their ‌Siri‌ interactions and feedback with Apple so that it can gain data to improve ‌Siri‌.



The app is reportedly available in the U.S., Canada, Germany, France, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, and Taiwan, but does not show under the Utilities category where it is published, on the ‌App Store‌ charts, or via search. Users must have a direct link to the app to be able to find it on the ‌App Store‌.

                    <span>Apple fans tend to accumulate old products in their homes, likely on a shelf or in a drawer collecting dust. Rather than letting Apple&#x27;s history become junk items for dust collection, Grid Studio aims to turn them into artistic wall decoration. 





Grid Studio, whose tagline is &quot;Every classic deserves to be framed,&quot; takes Apple products and breaks them down component-by-component, placing them in gorgeously labeled, neat, and organized frames for your home or office that beautifully respect the devices&#x27; intricate designs.



Grid Studio offers a selection of older-generation iPhones, with the most prized being the limited-edition original iPhone. Grid Studio is only offering 999 of the original iPhones in its frame collection, and each frame comes with a special plaque that let…</span>

                    <span>Blackmagic Design has announced a new update to its professional video editing and color correction software, DaVinci Resolve, that includes a new processing engine offering significantly better performance on Apple silicon Macs.





Thanks to the completely reworked engine, DaVinci Resolve 17.3 can work up to 3 times faster on Apple Mac models with the M1 chip, according to the company. The speed increase should make playback, editing, and grading of 4K and 8K projects faster using the software. 



The new processing engine also uses tile based rendering, which can give users on notebooks up to 30% longer battery when working in DaVinci Resolve.



In addition, version 17.3 supports a new option on Mac computers with ‌M1‌ for H.265 hardware encoding. It&#x27;s now possible to p…</span>

The claim appears in a piece covering the production of the upcoming ninth-generation iPad, which will reportedly include a PVD (physical vapor deposition) application to enhance the devices&#x27; scratch resistance.

The new iPad will also equip with aluminum-alloy chassis that will be processed by PVD. The sources also revealed that Apple is also considering equipping iPads with titanium-based metal chassis, but the high costs for doing so may not be economical at the moment.

                    <span>Apple is planning to hold multiple product events in September, rather than its strategy from last year to break up its fall product launches into three separate events split across September, October, and November, according to sources who spoke to DigiTimes.





In a new paywalled report today, the publication states that Apple will &quot;host a series of product launch conferences in September,&quot; with a highlight of one of the events being the ninth generation baseline iPad.



Apple has multiple new products in store for release this fall, ranging from the iPhone 13, Apple Watch Series 7, third-generation AirPods, an updated iPad mini, a new baseline iPad, and of course, the highly anticipated redesigned 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pros.

The interview, conducted in July, is in celebration of the Financial Review&#x27;s 70th anniversary. Cook begins the interview by sharing his morning routine, noting he likes to read emails from customers as it helps him keep a &quot;pulse on what customers are feeling.&quot;

Tim Cook likes to begin his days early; he&#x27;s at his desk by 4am. &quot;I do that because I can control the morning better than the evening and through the day.

                    <span>Twitter says it is rolling out a number of changes to the way direct messages work, including the ability to send a direct message to several people in different conversations. 





Going forward, Twitter says users will be able to share the same tweet in up to 20 separate direct message conversations, which should ensure &quot;no more (awkward) accidental group chats when you DM a tweet to multiple people.&quot;



Twitter says this change is rolling out on iOS and web over the next few weeks, with the changes coming &quot;soon&quot; on Android.



Twitter is also tweaking DM timestamps for iOS users in order to reduce &quot;timestamp clutter.&quot; Rather than having each message within a DM conversation stamped with the date and time, Messages will be grouped by day. 



In addition, the Twitter iOS app is gaining a couple of user interface tweaks, including a long-press gesture to access the &quot;add reaction&quot; buttons (previously only accessible via a double tap, and a new down-arrow button to return to the most recent message in a DM conversation after scrolling through.



Earlier this month, Twitter added support for Sign in With Apple, allowing new users to create an account using their Apple ID while hiding their true email address from the social network.

                    <span>Apple has delayed its plan to return employees back to the office until at least January, due to concerns over an increase in COVID-19 cases and the possible emergence of new variants, Bloomberg reports. 





Apple had previously planned to return to in-person work by early September, but the company delayed that timeline until October. Now, due to continued concerns, that timeframe has been further pushed back until at least January. 



In a memo sent to staff, obtained by Bloomberg, the company&#x27;s human resource and retail chief, Deirdre O’Brien, said that Apple is not planning to close its offices or retail stores that are currently open, but is encouraging employees to get vaccinated.

Philadelphia has locked up an RFA for a couple of seasons.
 The Philadelphia Flyers are continuing to work through their depth this summer and most recently, have brought back a familiar face to keep that dearth of mid-20’s forwards active.
Announced by the team on Friday, the Flyers have re-signed center Connor Bunnaman to a two-year deal that will have a two-way salary structure for the first season to a one-way deal in the second. Other than a league-minimum NHL salary of $750,000, further financial details have not been disclosed by the club.

The now-24-year-old returned to regular action last season after fighting Ewing’s sarcoma to win the Masterton Trophy.
 When you talk about perseverance, heart, character, and toughness, look no further than Flyers winger Oskar Lindblom. 
After battling a rare form of bone cancer that robbed him of what was a breakout 2019-20 season, Lindblom did the unthinkable — returning that very season to play in the Stanley Cup playoffs. Given what a tremendous battle Lindblom was facing, truly remarkable stuff that he was able to work his way into play shape after losing a ton of weight undergoing treatment for Ewing’s sarcoma. 
That taste of hockey propelled Lindblom into the offseason with sights set on getting fully back into shape and returnin…</span>

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *The City of Glendale has had quite enough of the crap coming from the Coyotes’ billionaire ownership. They called their bluff and are booting them from the arena. That’s wild. [Five For Howling]
*Anyhoo, the Flyers. This summer saw the most action, roster-wise, in a very long time. Remember the last time the team made such wholesale change? [NBC Sports Philly]
*We chatted with our pals at The Cannon about their newest addition, and our recent subtraction. [The Cannon]
*The Golden Knights are hanging some hopes on Nolan Patrick. Oh, those sweet summer children. [ProHockeyTalk]
*Owen Power has elected to go back to college rather than join the Sabres which... yeah, kid. Good choice. [Die By The Blade]
*A lot of fans are mad about the jerseys on the ads, but we’ve been here before, folks. And it was fine. [The Province]
*But yeah, here’s a deep dive on how the NHL came to the decision to bring advertisements to the hockey jerseys. [ESPN]
*And finally, speaking jersey ads... that’s the focus of a brand new episode of Flyperbole! Well, as much as an episode of Flyperbole can have a focus. [BSH]</span>

The first update to Inazuma hits in September 
 Genshin Impact’s giant update, The Immovable God and the Eternal Euthymia, is getting more content on Sept. 1. 
The 2.1 update, “Floating World Under the Moonlight,” will bring the main storyline in Inazuma to a close, and add new characters, additional boss fights, and two new islands to explore. And fishing is coming to Teyvat. (Everybody’s doing it!)
Genshin Impact developer Mihoyo released a trailer teasing some of the 2.1 content on Friday. It showed combat gameplay from new characters and a cinematic of Scaramouche laughing maniacally as the Traveler falls to the ground and blacks out — suggesting some sort of confrontation between the two. 
The update will bring new playable characters, including fan favorite Raiden Shogun (the Electro Archon also known as Baal) and Horizon Zero Dawn’s Aloy. Aloy will join the Genshin Impact cast in the 2.1 update as a free five-star archer, but comes first to those with PlayStation consoles via early access. Aloy and Shogun will be joined by Sangonomiya Kokomi, a five-star who wields the power of Hydro and is a catalyst, and Kujou Sara, a ranged attacker with Electro attacks.  
As for fishing, Mihoyo said in a news release that “players can soon go angling for a variety of fishes across the continent of Teyvat,” which can be used to produce fish meat of exchange for rewards.</span>

The announcement was made Friday in a video update by 343 Industries
 Halo Infinite won’t launch with two of the franchise’s most desirable features. Developers at 343 Industries said Friday that campaign co-op and the multiplayer map-editing Forge mode won’t be available when the game arrives. Forge in particular will lag behind “about six months.” The announcement was made on YouTube.
“Unfortunately as we focused the team for shutdown and really focused on a quality experience for launch we made the really tough decision to delay shipping campaign co-op for launch,” Staten said, “and we also made the tough call to delay shipping Forge past launch as well.”
343 announced one year ago that Halo Infinite would miss its original 2020 launch window, delaying the game into 2021. It still has no firm release date. On Friday, 343 said that the co-op campaign mode would be released as season 2 of Halo Infinite’s post-launch content, and that Forge mode would be part of season 3.
Staten said that these modes were delayed in order to ensure the quality of the base game.
“Our number one priority is making sure that whatever we ship, whenever we ship it, it meets the right quality bar across all platforms,” he said in the video. “And when we looked at these two experiences, campaign co-op and Forge, we made the determination they’re just not ready. And as a studio we don’t want to ship things if they’re not ready.”
Co-operative play has been at the heart of the Halo franchise since the beginning. Forge mode, which allows players to build their own multiplayer levels and game modes and share them online, was introduced with Halo 3 in 2007.</span>

Loads of new changes and decisions in a staple mode don’t seem like a lot, until they do
 Every year, Madden NFL seems to have a glaringly neglected mode. The great news — the best news — about Madden NFL 22: That mode is Madden Ultimate Team.
For once, MUT is the mode that goes begging. For once, Madden Ultimate Team is the mode that gets a maintenance-level update from last year. Good! Madden lifers have long resented MUT, for all its microtransactions and monetization, accusing it of sucking up what little oxygen a year’s development cycle leaves, while core features and gameplay are left gasping and semi-conscious. But for Madden NFL 22, EA Tiburon stood pat on MUT, and that alone is a message to the community, just as much as the Franchise m…</span>

Play on a selection of rotating maps in Trials this week
 Trials of Osiris is back in Destiny 2. Saint-14 is the new Trials vendor and announcer, and players can find him and his wares in the Tower Hangar every Friday at reset.
Each week, the Trials of Osiris map changes, as do the rewards for winning a certain number of matches. The rewards are consistent across all players, although each player’s weapon roll will differ.
Here are the guaranteed Trials of Osiris rewards this week:
Map: Rotating Maps
3 wins — Pyrrhic Ascent Cloak, Mark, Bond (Hunter, Titan, and Warlock class item)
5 wins — Shayura’s Wrath, Void submachine gun
7 wins — Pyrrhic Ascent Mask, Helm, Hood (Hunter, Titan, and Warlock helmet)
Flawless — Eye of Sol (Adept), Kinetic sniper rifle
Note: As of Season of Arrivals, players can complete the End Game weekly bounty — which just needs Trials match completions (wins give more progress) — to earn the three-win reward.
Players who manage to reach seven wins without a single loss can go to the Lighthouse social space — this is called a Flawless run. The Lighthouse offers additional rewards for players, some of which are unique, like a special emblem. Players who reach the Lighthouse also earn a special armor glow for any of their Trials of Osiris armor, which lasts for the remainder of the weekend.</span>

Head to the Tower for some Exotics
 The weekly Exotic item merchant, Xur, hangs out in random locations around the world of Destiny. In Destiny 2, he can appear all over the map, as well as inside the Tower. This week, you can find Xur in the Tower, in the Hangar, standing on the back steps.

Xur’s inventory this week consists of the following:
Trinity Ghoul, Arc bow: 29 Legendary Shards
Raiden Flux, Hunter chest: 23 Legendary Shards
One-Eyed Mask, Titan helmet: 23 Legendary Shards
Sanguine Alchemy, Warlock chest: 23 Legendary Shards
Exotic Engram: 97 Legendary Shards (you can now purchase a second with an Exotic Cipher)
Exotic Cipher quest: free


Xur’s items drop at a similar power level as your character.

Season of the Lost is one of Destiny 2’s biggest non-expansion updates in years
 Destiny 2’s upcoming Season of the Lost will see some major weapon changes. Players will not only get their hands on non-Exotic Stasis weapons for the first time, they’ll also see unlimited ammo for primary weapons and a host of potent Exotic changes.
In a blog post ahead of its Destiny Showcase on Tuesday, where players will learn all about season 15 and next year’s The Witch Queen expansion, Bungie detailed those Stasis weapons. Legendary Stasis weapons will go in either the Power slot — reserved for rocket launchers, drum-fed grenade launchers, swords, linear fusion rifles, and machine guns — or the kinetic slot.

Bungie revealed that Season of the Lost will start this Tuesday
 The name and art for Destiny 2’s 15th season leaked Thursday night, and Bungie officially confirmed it on Friday morning. Season of the Lost, starring Mara Sov, will start on Tuesday, Aug. 24, immediately following Bungie’s Destiny Showcase. The developer will reveal the new season and the upcoming The Witch Queen expansion during the livestream.
Normally, a simple season name and the reveal of its main characters only serve to hype players up. But Season of the Lost’s name and Mara’s involvement bring a certain weight: Both details appear in a major, months-old leak. With Bungie’s confirmation, one of the biggest rumors in the series’ history just got a lot more credible.

                    <span>For the New Yorker, the novelist Donald Antrim wrote about wanting to die by suicide and being saved by electroconvulsive therapy: Finding a Way Back from Suicide.
I had survived, or thought that I’d survived, my parents’ drinking and shouting, our constant moving, the losses of places and friends, annihilation after annihilation. I’d played in the yard, and smashed tennis balls against walls for hours, and built model airplanes, and listened to my records at night in my room. I’d slept with cats for company, and ridden my bike, and struggled in school, and, later in life, gone to bars, and then quit going to bars, and smoked cigarettes and pot, and fallen in love, and argued and made up, and refused to speak to my father, and suffered my mother. None of this had stopped my dying. Writing had not stopped my dying. The Twelve Steps had not stopped my dying. Therapy hadn’t stopped it, and my old friends couldn’t stop it; nor could Regan. No one could.

                    <span>I’ve been a bit obsessed recently with urban architecture that incorporates nature &amp; greenery into the mix, especially since seeing the technique employed so creatively in Singapore last year, so this new book called Evergreen Architecture is tickling that fancy right now.
As more of the earth’s surface is swallowed up by the built environment, architects are increasingly advised to integrate urban flora and fauna into their designs. Whether developing green roofs, living walls, abundant indoor courtyards, or balconies that connect interior and exterior spaces, the urge to intertwine nature and architecture has never been more apparent.
Embracing this ubiquitous trend, Evergreen Architecture surveys a broad spectrum of residential, institutional, urban, and rural spaces. But as change occurs and solutions to the climate crisis are being integrated on the ground, many new questions are posed. How do residents keep moss-covered walls alive? How can a skyscraper uphold the weight of hundreds of trees?


You can order the book from Bookshop. (via colossal)

                    <span>The United States Federal Trade Commission today reinforced its antitrust case against Facebook by providing more detail on how the company either crushed or bought out its rivals in an attempt to get rid of competition.





The updated filing is longer than the original complaint and it offers additional evidence in favor of the FTC&#x27;s argument that Facebook is a monopolist, plus it again asks the judge overseeing the case to force Facebook to sell Instagram and WhatsApp, the two social networking apps that Facebook also operates.



In the complaint, the FTC says that Facebook used an illegal &quot;buy-or-bury&quot; scheme to maintain its dominance in the social networking market after it failed to &quot;develop innovative mobile features&quot; during the transition from desktop to mobile devices.…</span>

                    <span>Apple supplier Foxconn is making a major push into electric vehicle manufacturing and has long been aiming to get into the vehicle market, according to a new profile of Foxconn&#x27;s car ambitions that was shared by Nikkei.





&quot;If we can make iPhones, why can&#x27;t we make EVs?&quot; Foxconn founder and former chairman Terry Gou said in an internal meeting. &quot;It is an iPhone with four wheels.&quot;



Foxconn has been pursuing electric vehicles since 2014 when there was an &quot;A-Fu Initiative&quot; to build an electric vehicle prototype. That project ultimately folded because of the complexity of creating a car, but Foxconn is once again building up a vehicle supply chain with plans to get into EV manufacturing.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/19/apple-closes-store-in-south-carolina/">

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(8 min)</span>
                    <span>Apple has temporarily shut down its retail store located in Charleston, South Carolina after more than 20 staff members were exposed to or tested positive for COVID-19, reports Bloomberg.





According to the website for the store, it will be shuttered until Monday, August 23. According to Bloomberg, stores of this size typically have 70 to 80 employees, so around a quarter of the staff may have been exposed.



Apple appears to be suffering from staff shortages at the Charleston store and other retail locations, both because of COVID exposures and the difficult labor market. Stores remain operational at this time, but some have been forced to close earlier and open later because of a lack of staff.



Continuing issues with the delta variant of COVID-19 have impacted Apple&#x27;s store plans. Apple stopped requiring customers and employees to wear masks back in June, but then reinstated mask mandates at many retail locations in the United States in late July. So far though, Apple has not reinstated widespread store shutdowns.



Apple had also planned to bring back in-person Today at Apple classes on August 30, but has since pushed back those plans because of the prevalence of the delta variant.

                    <span>With the introduction of iOS 15, Apple rebadged its paid iCloud plans to &quot;‌iCloud‌+&quot; to reflect the fact that subscribers now get access to additional privacy features like Private Relay and Hide My Email. This article explains what Hide My Email is and how to use it.





Hide My Email builds on the idea of Sign in With Apple by providing you with unique, random email addresses that forward to your personal inbox whenever you want to keep your personal email address private. 



It&#x27;s especially useful if you suspect that a business you&#x27;re transacting with is likely to share your email address with ad agencies or other third-parties for marketing purposes. Using a random email address means you can delete the address at any time, ensuring unsolicited emails don&#x27;t reach your inbox…</span>

                    <span>Nanoleaf today announced the addition of Thread Border Router technology to the Nanoleaf Shapes and Elements Controllers, with the functionality available through a firmware update in the Nanoleaf app.





With the Nanoleaf Border Router, Nanoleaf Essentials devices will be able to connect to the Thread network automatically when the Shapes or Elements Controller is connected to WiFi.



Nanoleaf is also partnering with Eero for similar capabilities. The Eero Pro, Eero Beacon, Eero Pro 6, and Eero 6 will function as Border Routers with the Nanoleaf Essentials line. Eero will expand compatibility with other products in the future.



Nanoleaf is one of the first companies bringing Thread Border Routers to the HomeKit network, making Thread technology available to other Thread-based smart home devices.



Thread technology is designed to improve the smart home networking and usage experience. Thread is a networking protocol designed for smart home products, and it offers improved connectivity, reliability, and range compared to the single connection points of Bluetooth and WiFi. Border Router technology connects a Thread network to another network like WiFi and is essential for the Thread system.



With Thread Border Router functionality built into the Nanoleaf Shapes Controller, Elements Controller, and Eero routers, there is no need for an extra hub because these devices serve as a bridge to connect the WiFi network and the Thread network together.

                    <span>Apple is researching a MacBook keyboard that features a removable key to be used as a precision mouse, according to a newly published patent application.





The patent application, first spotted by Patently Apple, is titled &quot;Deployable Key Mouse&quot; and was filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.



The filing envisages a standard-looking MacBook scissor-system keyboard that features a hidden removable key. This key would contain a position sensor to be used as a pointing device. Apple describes the system as providing a &quot;comfortable, portable, and precise pointer input for a computer input system.&quot;

                    <span>Apple TV+ today shared the official trailer for highly-anticipated sci-fi series &quot;Foundation&quot; ahead of its premiere on September 24.






Based on the best-selling novels by Isaac Asimov, Apple says &quot;Foundation&quot; is an epic saga chronicling a band of exiles on their monumental journey to save humanity and rebuild civilization amid the fall of the Galactic Empire.
When revolutionary Dr. Hari Seldon predicts the impending fall of the Empire, he and a band of loyal followers venture to the far reaches of the galaxy to establish The Foundation in an attempt to rebuild and preserve the future of civilization. Enraged by Hari&#x27;s claims, the ruling Cleons – a long line of emperor clones – fear their grasp on the galaxy may be weakening as they&#x27;re forced to reckon with the potential reality of losing their legacy forever.
&quot;Foundation&quot; stars Emmy Award nominees Jared Harris and Lee Pace, alongside Lou Llobell, Leah Harvey, Laura Birn, Terrence Mann, Cassian Bilton, and Alfred Enoch.



The first episode of &quot;Foundation&quot; will be released on Apple TV+ on September 24, followed by one new episode weekly every Friday. Series writer and showrunner David Goyer hopes to tell the story over the course of 80 episodes.



Apple TV+ costs $4.99 per month, with a free seven-day trial available, or a longer trial available with the purchase of select new Apple products.

                    <span>Apple today highlighted that the Apple Card and Goldman Sachs has been ranked top for customer satisfaction in the midsized issuer credit card segment, according to J.D. Power.





The J.D. Power 2021 U.S. Credit Card Satisfaction Study showed that the ‌Apple Card‌ ranked highest with a score of 864.1, across all of the surveyed categories including interaction, credit card terms, communication, benefits and services, rewards, and key moments. Apple&#x27;s vice president of Apple Pay, Jennifer Bailey, said:
It is exciting to be recognized with this first J.D. Power win, just two years after introducing Apple Card in 2019 and the first time being included in this study. We designed Apple Card to help our customers lead healthier financial lives, so it&#x27;s incredibly meaningful to see that our customers are valuing this. Being recognized as the leader in this category this year is an honor, and we look forward to continuing to deliver this product, service, and support with our award-winning issuer as Apple Card expands to more and more customers across the U.S.




The ‌Apple Card‌ launched in 2019 as a no-fee credit card designed for the iPhone and supported by Goldman Sachs, featuring Apple Wallet integration and Daily Cash rewards with up to three percent cashback. The card is only available in the United States.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(8 min)</span>
                    <span>Images of an aluminum cutout allegedly based on the upcoming sixth-generation iPad mini have surfaced online. The cutout is largely in line with rumors of what we can expect in the ‌iPad mini‌ 6, including a larger display in lieu of a Home button, a thinner body, and flat edges.





The images originated from the website techordo.com in cooperation with a leaker named xleaks7, whose track record for accurate leaks isn&#x27;t very well established. The cutout showcases a design much in line with renders of the upcoming ‌iPad mini‌ shared by Apple leaker Jon Prosser earlier in June.



One interesting new change the images depict is the relocation of the volume buttons. The volume buttons on iPads have always been on the right side, however, the images show the buttons relocated to the top, on the opposite side of the power button. 



The new ‌iPad mini‌ will take inspiration from the updated iPad Air and iPad Pro by ditching the Home Button in favor of an all-screen design. Apple is unlikely to provide users with Face ID embedded into the bezel and is expected instead to integrate Touch ID into the power button, similar to the ‌iPad Air‌. It&#x27;s also expected to feature a faster processor and possibly USB-C. 



Reliable Bloomberg journalist Mark Gurman has reported that the new iPad mini is on track to be released this fall, alongside new iPhones, Apple Watches, AirPods, and MacBook Pros.

                    <span>As the back-to-school season kicks in, Apple plans to update its baseline iPad this fall with a new ninth-generation model tailored towards students, sporting a thinner design and an improved processor, according to Bloomberg&#x27;s Mark Gurman.





In September of last year, Apple updated the baseline iPad with the faster and more powerful A12 Bionic chip starting at $329, or $299 for education customers. The baseline update sits at the lower end of the ‌iPad‌ lineup and is tailored for customers needing an affordable ‌iPad‌ for day-to-day use.



For the 9th generation model, Apple is likely to continue with the current design featuring Touch ID and a Home Button. The updated model will feature a faster processor with improved performance and graphics and a thinner form factor.



The updated ‌iPad‌ joins a busy fall season for Apple, as the company is also expected to be preparing a more significant update to the iPad mini. The new iPad mini is rumored to feature a larger display with smaller bezels, improved performance, and an updated overall design. Apple is also preparing new iPhones, Apple Watches, AirPods, and MacBook Pros for launch in the coming months.

                    <span>Apple this evening began offering refurbished versions of the 24-inch M1 iMac in its U.S. online store, one day after starting to sell refurbished ‌M1‌ iMacs in the UK.





Apple has over a dozen ‌M1‌ iMacs available at the current time, and this is the first time the ‌M1‌ iMacs have been available through the refurbished store in the U.S. since the machines launched in April.



The entry-level model with 8-core GPU, 7-core GPU, and 256GB SSD is available for $1,099, which is a $200 discount from the regular price of $1,299.



Apple also has higher-end refurbished models available for purchase, up to an 8-core CPU and 8-core GPU option with a 1TB SSD and 16GB RAM, which is available for $1,779. At full price, the machine would cost $2,099.



There are multiple color options and configurations available at the current time, though stock will fluctuate going forward based on the machines that people are sending Apple for repairs and returns.



Apple&#x27;s refurbished ‌M1‌ iMacs are sold with the same one-year warranty offered with a new ‌iMac‌, plus they come with all manuals and accessories. Apple uses a rigorous testing, repair, repackaging, and cleaning process to ensure refurbished devices are identical to new devices.

                    <span>Hello! Recently I’ve been thinking about why I explain things the way I do. The
usual way I write is:
Try to learn a topic
Read a bunch of explanations that I find confusing
Eventually understand the topic
Write an explanation that makes sense to me, to help others
So why do I find all these explanations so confusing? I decided to try and find
out! I came up with a list of 12 patterns that make explanations hard for me to
understand. For each pattern I’ll also explain what I like to do instead to
avoid the issue.
these patterns are very normal
This list isn’t meant to make you feel bad about your writing. I’ve probably
done all of these things! I’m certainly going to do them again! I even did at
least one of them while writing this post!
But knowing that I’m likely to accidently do these t…</span>

Nightborne and Lightforged Draenei get a treat
 When World of Warcraft: Shadowlands launched, there was with a buffet of character customization options for humans, night elves, orcs, and undead. However, a few of the races — especially the game’s Allied Races, which don’t have their own starting zone and can only be unlocked in the end game — fell a little short. Blizzard stated that they would not be revisiting the issue during Shadowlands, but it looks like that’s about to change. On Thursday, a community manager shared the following information on the official Blizzard forums.

The anniversary edition arrives Nov. 11
 Bethesda announced a new edition of the fantasy RPG The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim on Thursday, during QuakeCon at Home 2021. Skyrim is about to turn 10, which is a very momentous anniversary indeed, and the new Anniversary Edition will have some nice bonuses for players. 
Skyrim’s Anniversary Edition will be available for players on the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. The Anniversary Edition contains the full game, all enhancements from the Special Edition, and the Dawnguard, Hearthfire, and Dragonborn expansions.
The game comes with a free next-gen console upgrade, over 500 Creation Club elements like quests, dungeons, bosses, and weapons.  Also, there’s fishing now, which is great. You could argue that Skyrim didn’t need a fishing pole, but it’s always nice to have a fishing minigame, and the elements from popular mods will likely round the experience out as well.
It’s a common joke that Skyrim will never die, especially because Bethesda continues to re-release and port the game. The base game can run on less powerful platforms like the Nintendo Switch, and in 2018, Bethesda debuted a joke announcement for Skyrim: Very Special Edition, which is an actual playable game on the iPhone, iPad, and Amazon Echo ... as long as you can figure out the voice commands. The Elder Scrolls 6 remains elusive, but fans will be able to tuck into Skyrim once again and enjoy all of their old quests — as well as a new spin, thanks to fishing.</span>

Plus, you can date weapons
 The sincerity with which developer Kitfox Games enters into Boyfriend Dungeon is contagious. It’d otherwise be easy to write the game off as a joke, a concept that’s wacky just to be wacky. I mean, it’s a dating simulator in which you date people that can turn into weapons, which can then be used to fight through monstrous dungeons. But it’s a concept that’s executed in earnest, with thoughtfulness and care grounding the otherwise implausible world. It was easy to just go with it. So yeah, the game is about dating people that you’ll also use as weapons to fight your insecurities. What of it?

Black Panther absorbs attacks 
 Marvel’s Avengers’ version of Black Panther is impervious to most attacks, and it makes him as kinetic to play as his MCU counterpart is to watch.
The first expansion for Marvel’s Avengers, War for Wakanda, hit the game earlier this week and added Black Panther to the list of playable heroes. With the roster up to nine Avengers, making the heroes stand out is key to the games’ success. But Black Panther has some defensive abilities that make him a blast to play. 
There are three different varieties of enemy attacks in Marvel’s Avengers: light attacks, strong attacks, and unblockable attacks. For strong attacks, players either need to time a parry to avoid damage or dodge out of the way. And as you might expect, un…</span>

Plus a new Quake expansion pack
 Three Quake games — Quake, Quake 2, and Quake 3 Arena — are now available through Xbox Game Pass. Microsoft announced the additions on Thursday alongside the start of QuakeCon 2021, shortly after id Software revealed and released a remastered version of the original Quake.
Quake’s enhanced version is available on Xbox consoles and Windows PC via Xbox Game Pass, while Quake 2 and Quake 3: Arena can be played on Windows PC through the subscription service “in their original form.” In other words, Quake 2 and Quake 3 haven’t been remastered. Players looking to enjoy Quake 2 in prettier form should check out the free Quake 2 RTX release, pictured above.
Bethesda Software’s remastered Quake, a new version of the 25-year-old game, has 4K resolution support, cross-platform play, enhanced visuals, and a new expansion pack from Wolfenstein developer MachineGames. It’s also available on its own on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 (and PlayStation 5 via backward compatibility), and Windows PC.
The three Quake games join a lineup that includes more than 30 Bethesda Softworks-published titles, many of which were added to Xbox Game Pass following Microsoft’s acquisition of Bethesda.</span>

The original Colors is from 2010, but this animation is all new
 Sonic Colors: Ultimate is an upcoming remaster of the original Wii platformer, and Sega has released a cartoon for players who need a refresher on the game’s lore. “Rise of the Wisps” is a two-part animation, and the first part was released on Thursday. Directed by Tyson Hesse, the artist behind Sonic Mania Adventures, Rise of the Wisps tells the story of Sonic, Tails, and one Jade Wisp, who needs help taking down Dr. Eggman.
The animations and cartoons surrounding Sonic releases are some of the best hedgehog-related content in years. Even if you’re not a fan of the games themselves, it’s nice to see that Tails, Sonic and company are still up to their old hijinks. While the upcoming Part 2 of Rise of the Wisps will probably have much more action, Part 1 helps set the scene, and it includes some fun exchanges between Tails, the Jade Wisp, and Sonic.
The next mainline game in the Sonic series is currently planned for 2022, and is a 3D game, although details are otherwise light. Sonic Colors: Ultimate is set to release on Sept. 7 on the Epic Games Store, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.</span>

id Software classic gets 4K/60 fps support and new expansion from MachineGames
 Bethesda Softworks released a remastered version of the original Quake, the landmark first-person shooter id Software published 25 years ago, on Thursday. The new version of Quake includes 4K resolution support, cross-platform play, enhanced visuals, and a brand-new expansion pack from Wolfenstein developer MachineGames.
The remastered Quake is available now on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows PC, and Xbox One, and is playable through backward compatibility on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. On PC, Steam and Bethesda Launcher users who already own Quake will automatically receive the new version with a free download. 
In terms of visuals, players can expect improved lighting and models, dynamic shadows, motion blur, and anti-aliasing. The game’s score, produced by Nine Inch Nails’ Trent Reznor, is also included. Expansion packs Scourge of Armagon, Dissolution of Eternity, and Dimension of the Past (the new, MachineGames-created add-on), are now included as part of the standard Quake package. More details are available at Bethesda’s announcement.
The original Quake, which launched in the summer of 1996, was id’s successor to the Doom series. Although it, too, launched as a single-player FPS with a campaign, it became much more popular as a multiplayer arena shooter. It was followed by four sequels between 1997 and 2007.
Bethesda acquired id Software and its franchises in 2009, but the only Quake title published since then is 2017’s Quake Champions on Windows PC, which is now a free-to-play game.</span>

But maybe a good game isn’t the point
 Fortnite’s new Impostors event is simple: Ten players enter a station, but two of them are impostors. The innocent crew members need to complete a series of tasks around the map without getting murdered — or at least while catching the murderer as quickly as possible. Yes, there’s no way around it: It’s Among Us. 
Among Us’ gameplay loop is simple and lean; Fortnite’s Imposters clutters it up. Impostors is visually busy and crowded, and it’s not just because everyone has their fancy 3D model with custom skins and emotes attached. It’s hard to see myself playing it with family members, much less politicians using it as a public outreach tool. 
It’s a worse game, but that’s not the point. Actually watching streams or playing t…</span>

Health regen is back
 Call of Duty: Vanguard will bring the series back to World War II. But it’s not a continuation of developer Sledgehammer Games’ previous WWII game, nor will Vanguard carry over Call of Duty: WWII’s health pack system. Vanguard will instead use the automatic health regeneration system common to modern Call of Duty games.
During a presentation lead by Sledgehammer Games, Call of Duty: Vanguard game director Josh Bridge said that the game’s campaign will feature automatic health regen, for a “more unified experience.
“[The] campaign will have auto health regen,” Bridge said in a statement to Polygon. “[The] goal is to keep to a more unified experience between modes, and matching health systems was something that the team felt was important. Coupled with that decision, each of the main characters you play as bring unique to them abilities/mechanics in their levels. This further drives an overall sense of gameplay variety across the campaign, but also these abilities help distinguish each character’s identity.”
Call of Duty: Vanguard will span four theaters of war and four playable characters: Sgt. Arthur Kingsley, of Britain’s 9th Parachute Battalion; Lt. Polina Petrova, of the Soviet 138th Rifle Division; Captain Wade Jackson, from the U.S.’s Scouting Squadron Six; and Second Lieutenant Lucas Riggs of Australia’s 20th Battalion. For more on the game, check out Polygon’s preview.
At the same time that Vanguard is being shown for the first time, Call of Duty publisher Activision Blizzard faces wide-ranging allegations that it maintains a toxic workplace environment that is particularly hostile to women. A lawsuit, filed by California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing in July, alleges the company pays women less, subjects them to sexual harassment, and that perpetrators are not meaningfully punished.

Vanguard Zombies will tie into Black Ops Cold War’s Zombies mode
 Treyarch’s Call of Duty Zombies modes are usually limited to the games the studio develops itself, but that’s not the case this time around. During Thursday’s announcement stream for Call of Duty: Vanguard, Activision revealed that the Sledgehammer-developed game will feature a Zombies mode made by Treyarch.
Treyarch’s latest Zombie content was for Black Ops Cold War, which it also developed. Unlike previous games, the Zombie content in Black Ops Cold War came as part of free seasonal updates to the game, rather than expansion packs that players had to pay for. On top of the extremely popular round-based maps, Treyarch also introduced a new mode called Outbreak that throws players and zombies together inside a massive open area where players have to complete a series of random objectives. 
Treyarch’s Zombies entries have also continued to tell an ongoing story, which just got a new update with the latest round-based map. It’s unclear if the Zombies mode in Vanguard will continue Treyarch’s Black Ops storyline or be something entirely separate. 
Call of Duty: Vanguard will be released on Nov. 5. Activision and Treyarch hasn’t announced if the Zombies mode will arrive when the game launches or sometime after. 
At the same time Vanguard is being shown for the first time, Call of Duty publisher Activision Blizzard faces wide-ranging allegations that it maintains a toxic workplace environment that is particularly hostile to women. A lawsuit, filed by California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing in July, alleges the company pays women less, subjects them to sexual harassment, and that perpetrators are not meaningfully punished.

                    <span>Americans are collectively almost $15 trillion in debt, most of it related to housing (i.e. mortgage debt). For the New Yorker, Margaret Talbot shares some images from Brittany Powell’s The Debt Project, a series of 99 portraits of Americans in debt.
Powell set about photographing ninety-nine Americans who owe money (she ended up with a few more, including herself, but started with that figure as a reference to the slogan “We are the ninety-nine per cent”) and asked them to handwrite accompanying text about how much they owe, and to whom. The litany of reasons gets repetitive, because that’s how it goes — difficulty finding a job in one’s field after graduating during the recession, a bad marriage, a bad divorce, vertiginous rents in expensive cities, medical crises, many, many student loans. Occasionally, there are epic and awful variations: one woman’s mother took out credit cards in her name and, in a ten-year period, racked up “a mortgage worth of debt” to fund her “compulsive shopping and hoarding habits.”


The Debt Project is also available in book form.

It is eerie and weird and uncanny and all other such adjectives watching these machines smoothly caper around like humans. Even in the blooper reel they seem really toddler-esque.

                    <span>Jumbo the Elephant was one of the most famous animals in the world. Bought as a calf in Sudan by a European animal dealer in 1860, Jumbo found fame first at the London Zoo and later as the centerpiece of the Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus in the US. Jumbo was so beloved in London that news of his sale to P.T. Barnum prompted 100,000 children to write to Queen Victoria, urging her to nix the deal. In the video above, Andrew McClellan recounts Jumbo’s too-short (and probably unhappy) life and the impact he had on society.
The word “jumbo” hadn’t been known or used in the English language before he came along and has since become the byword for anything humongous or supersized. So every time we use the word “jumbo jet” or “jumbotron”, we’re actually referring back to Jumbo the elephant.

                    <span>When I reviewed Fed Ash’s monumental 2020 LP, Diurnal Traumas, I was sure that the band had produced the harshest, most terrifying release of its already impressive career. The album was bleak and hopeless, furious and frenzied. A little over a year later, however, the band has surpassed themselves, descending to a darker nadir of […]

                    <span>In the early 1900s, when the circus came to town, everyone took the day off. The factory you worked at would close for the day. All the shopkeepers would lock up and head to see the animals and sideshow performers who they’d seen parading into town. In 1910, the Ringling Bros. hired Harry A. Atwell […]

                    <span>Juli Clover, again:
Apple in iOS 15 beta 6 has added a toggle to move the Safari
address bar to the top of the interface, which returns Safari to
an iOS 14-like design and mitigates all of the Safari changes
introduced in earlier betas.
Those who prefer the bottom bar can still opt to have that toggled
on with the Tab Bar view, but Apple has also changed the look and
the url bar at the bottom has been merged with a dedicated control
panel that does away with trying to merge all page management
options into a single address bar view.
I was a little worried when beta 5 shipped last week and Safari’s interface was unchanged, but beta 6’s changes are very good.
The initial iOS Safari 15 design failed in two big ways. First and foremost, Apple tried to squeeze two horizontal bars’ worth of cont…</span>

                    <span>Juli Clover, writing for MacRumors:
Netflix is rolling out support for Spatial Audio on the iPhone and
the iPad, based on reports shared by MacRumors readers
and on Reddit. A Netflix spokesperson also confirmed to
MacRumors that the rollout is underway.
When you’re watching a movie on an iPhone or iPad, spatial audio is a  game changer for degree of immersiveness. Henceforth when preloading a movie or two for a plane trip, I’ll favor titles with spatial audio support. It really helps make up for the small screen by having big immersive sound.
Not surprised that Netflix is adding support sooner rather than later — one thing Netflix gets right is they want viewers to be happy. Spatial audio makes me happy.

*The dev camp participant list is looking pretty good top to bottom, honestly. Should be fun to watch, if we can go. [Inquirer]
*Robert Hagg, good luck out there buddy. You had a good season on your way out the door. [BSH]
*Cam Atkinson seems to bring a lot to the table, but there are two specific ways he should be able to help the Flyers in a big way this season. [NBC Sports Philly]
*The Flyers’ most recently drafted goalie doesn’t crack to top ten, but he got darn close. [The Athletic]
*Yesterday we learned, officially, that jersey advertisements are coming to the NHL this season. [ProHockeyTalk]
*And finally, with that news being reports, we couldn’t help but wonder: whose logo should make its way onto the Flyers’ orange and black? [BSH]</span>

                    <span>Johnny Cirillo photographs people on the streets of New York in the style of paparazzi (half a block away with a long lens) and posts them, with permission, to his Instagram account. From an interview with Cirillo in Vogue:
I decided early-on that if I was going to shoot candids of New Yorkers, I didn’t want it to be with a wide lens, up-close in their faces. I started using a 200mm lens so that I could be half a city block away from the subject. It’s similar to the way paparazzi shoot, and all my subjects are celebrities to me, so it’s fitting in that respect.

                    <span>Apple today seeded the sixth beta of the upcoming watchOS 8 update to developers for testing purposes, with the update coming one week after Apple released the fifth watchOS 8 beta.





To install ‌‌watchOS 8‌‌, developers will need to download the configuration profile from the Apple Developer Center. Once installed, ‌‌watchOS 8‌‌ can be downloaded through the dedicated Apple Watch app on the iPhone by going to General &gt; Software update.



To update to new software, an Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery life, it must be placed on the charger, and it needs to be in range of the ‌‌iPhone‌‌. It&#x27;s not recommended to install ‌‌watchOS 8‌‌ on a main Apple Watch as the software may be unstable at this early date.

                    <span>Apple released the sixth beta of iOS 15 just a week after the fifth beta, but the new update brings some of the most significant tweaks that we&#x27;ve seen to ‌iOS 15‌ during the beta testing period.





Safari Redesign


Apple in ‌iOS 15‌ beta 6 has added a toggle to move the Safari address bar to the top of the interface, which returns Safari to an iOS 14-like design and mitigates all of the Safari changes introduced in earlier betas.





Those who prefer the bottom bar can still opt to have that toggled on with the Tab Bar view, but Apple has also changed the look and the url bar at the bottom has been merged with a dedicated control panel that does away with trying to merge all page management options into a single address bar view.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/17/google-5g-low-cost-pixel-5a-smartphone/">

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(8 min)</span>
                    <span>Google today announced the launch of the low-cost 5G Pixel 5a, a follow up to the Pixel 4a that debuted last year. At its $449 price point, the Pixel 5a most closely competes with the $399 iPhone SE, which is $50 cheaper, though it has a similar feature set to Apple&#x27;s $699 iPhone 12 mini thanks to the inclusion of 5G.





Apple is rumored to be working on a new version of the ‌iPhone SE‌ that will also include 5G, with the device set to launch in 2022. The updated ‌iPhone SE‌ will be positioned as Apple&#x27;s cheapest 5G iPhone, and based on the $449 price point of the Pixel 5a, it could be priced similarly to keep it competitive with lower-cost Android devices.



In addition to 5G mmWave and sub-6GHz connectivity, the Pixel 5a brings a bigger 6.3-inch hole punch display that offers more available screen space than the prior Pixel 4a, so it may still have an edge over Apple&#x27;s upcoming 2022 ‌iPhone SE‌. The new ‌iPhone SE‌ is rumored to feature a design that&#x27;s &quot;roughly the same&quot; as the current ‌iPhone SE‌, which is modeled after the iPhone 8.



Other Pixel 5a features include IP67 water resistance, a dual camera setup with wide and ultra wide lenses, a 4,620mAh battery, 6GB RAM, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G chip.



Google is selling the Pixel 5a with an 18W adapter that supports fast charging, but Google is taking a page from Apple&#x27;s playbook. The Pixel 5a will be the last Pixel phone that will include a charger, according to The Verge. Google says that because most people already have a charging brick, its future phones, including the upcoming Pixel 6, will not ship with one.



Apple stopped providing a 5W charger with ‌iPhone‌ models in 2020 and in most countries, iPhones no longer come with a charger.

                    <span>Apple today released a new firmware update for the Siri Remote designed for the new Apple TV 4K and ‌Apple TV‌ HD models. The new firmware has an internal version number of 9M6772, while the prior firmware version was 9M6336. Note that this is not the firmware version that you see in the ‌Apple TV‌ Remote settings. 





There&#x27;s no word on what&#x27;s new with the ‌Apple TV‌ remote update, but it likely addresses minor bugs and performance issues. 



Apple has not detailed how to install a firmware update for the ‌Siri‌ Remote, but it&#x27;s likely similar to AirPods, delivered silently and over the air while the ‌Apple TV‌ is asleep. Firmware updates are installed in the background and it may take some time for the ‌Siri‌ Remote update to be downloaded and installed.

                    <span>Tweetbot 6 designed for the iPhone and the iPad today received a major update, with Tapbots introducing several significant new features that are designed to make the app experience better than ever.





There&#x27;s now a Tweetbot 6 widget that can be added to the Today View or the Home Screen, and it shows the Twitter timeline. A single tweet can be shown in the smallest widget view, but there are also larger options that show more tweets at a glance.



When using the Tweetbot 6 update on iOS devices, there&#x27;s now support for Handoff, so you can resume what you were doing on one device on another device using the built-in Handoff feature. Handoff does not yet work on the Mac, but support will be added later.



Tweetbot 6 now supports Shortcuts so Tweetbot actions can be used in the shortcuts created on iOS devices, plus on the ‌iPad‌, multiple Tweetbot windows are now supported for multitasking purposes. There are also additional app icons to choose from.



Tweetbot 6 can be downloaded from the App Store for free, but a subscription costs $5.99 per year or $0.99 per month. [Direct Link]

                    <span>Apple has renewed &quot;Carpool Karaoke: The Series&quot; for a fifth season, and with the renewal, the TV show will be migrating from Apple Music to Apple TV+. &quot;Carpool Karaoke&quot; could be watched through the ‌Apple Music‌ app or the Apple TV app, but it has not previously been a part of ‌Apple TV+‌ and limited to ‌Apple TV+‌ subscribers.





Based on the &quot;Carpool Karaoke&quot; segment of the &quot;The Late Late Show With James Corden,&quot; Apple&#x27;s version of &quot;Carpool Karaoke&quot; has been available since 2017.



Filming on &quot;Carpool Karaoke&quot; has been on hiatus due to the ongoing pandemic, according to Deadline, but efforts are underway to begin production once again.



&quot;Carpool Karaoke: The Series&quot; brings various actors, athletes, and musicians together to chat and sing popular songs with one another. The fourth season of the show featured pairings like Maya Rudolph and Haim, Keegan-Michael Key and Rob Gronkowski, and the &quot;Shark Tank&quot; sharks.



There&#x27;s no word yet on which celebrities will be featured in the fifth season of the show.

                    <span>Apple&#x27;s next Apple Watch Activity Challenge is set to take place on Saturday, August 28th, in celebration of national parks worldwide.





Apple will ask Apple Watch owners to complete a hike, walk, run, or wheelchair workout of a mile to earn a special National Parks award.
Let&#x27;s take a day to appreciate the beauty of national parks all over the world. On August 28, earn this award by recording a hike, walk, run, or wheelchair workout of a mile (1.6K) or more with any app that adds workouts to Health.
As with all Activity Challenges, the award will be accompanied by animated stickers that can be used in the Messages app.

















Apple always celebrates national parks in August, and last year introduced an Apple Pay donation program and highlighted Apple TV+ content, Apple Music songs, podcasts, books, and more all focused on national parks.

                    <span>Apple in iOS 15 introduced a new Safari experience that moves the URL bar and tab interface to the bottom of the iPhone, a decision that has been controversial with ‌iPhone‌ users.




Safari options in ‌iOS 15‌ beta 6


Throughout the beta testing period, Apple has been tweaking the design of the Safari browser on the ‌iPhone‌ and in beta 6, there are further refinements. The bottom tab bar has been redesigned to appear below page content, and Apple has also added a toggle to show the address bar at the top of the ‌iPhone‌ rather than the bottom.




The original design in ‌iOS 15‌ beta 5


The addition of a toggle to show the address bar at the top of the Safari interface returns Safari to a more iOS 14-like experience, walking back many of the ‌iOS 15‌ changes.





With the bottom view option toggled on, Safari offers a dedicated toolbar with buttons at the bottom of the interface, which is also an improvement over the prior floating design.



Apple has also introduced new setting options to remove the website tinting and to enable a Tab Bar while in landscape mode. There was previously a &quot;Show Color in Tab Bar&quot; accessibility setting, which appears to be the same as the new &quot;Allow Website Tinting&quot; toggle.  



Apple previously added similar toggles in iPadOS 15 and macOS Monterey to offer either a separate tab bar (which was the original default when the betas launched) or a merged tab bar, which is more similar to the previous design.

                    <span>In the beta notes for the sixth updates to iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and tvOS 15, Apple says that the FaceTime SharePlay feature has been disabled for future beta releases and will not be available to use when the updates initially launch this fall. 





Apple will instead make SharePlay available in an update to ‌iOS 15‌, ‌iPadOS 15‌, tvOS 15, and macOS Monterey that&#x27;s coming later this year. 



With SharePlay being removed temporarily, Apple is offering an alternative tool for developers to test SharePlay development features, and a SharePlay profile is available for developers to download. 
SharePlay has been disabled for use in iOS and iPadOS 15 developer beta 6 and will be disabled for use in its initial release this fall. SharePlay will be enabled for use again in future developer beta releases and will launch to the public in software updates later this fall. To continue your development, we have provided a SharePlay Development Profile which will enable successful creation and reception of GroupSessions via the Group Activities API.
With SharePlay, ‌FaceTime‌ users can share their screens with one another, watch movies and TV shows in sync together, listen to music and contribute to a group playlist, and more.

Players will be tasked with assisting adventurer, archeologist, and Temple Runner Scarlett Fox, solving puzzles to overcome obstacles. Players will create powerful match 3 combos and use special pieces to become the Temple Champion, sending out runners to chase treasure before the demon monkey catches up to them. New match 3 levels will be added on a regular basis.

                    <span>Apple today seeded the sixth beta of the upcoming tvOS 15 update to developers for testing purposes, with the new beta coming one week released the fifth beta.





Developers can download the new tvOS 15 beta by downloading a profile onto the ‌Apple TV‌ using Xcode.



Apple shared little about tvOS 15 when it was unveiled, but there are some new features that are coming to the operating system. SharePlay, a FaceTime feature that lets multiple users watch TV shows or movies together, will integrate with tvOS, and there&#x27;s a new &quot;For All of You&quot; recommendation engine that suggests shows everyone might enjoy.



A Shared With You section also displays movies and shows that were shared with you through the Messages app so you remember to check them out. When paired with AirPods Pro or AirPods Max, the ‌Apple TV‌ supports Spatial audio for a theater-like surround sound experience, and there&#x27;s a new feature for automatically connecting your AirPods through Smart ‌AirPods‌ routing.



Hey Siri commands can be used to launch Apple TV+ shows, and two HomePod mini speakers can be paired with the ‌Apple TV‌ 4K for stereo sound. If you have HomeKit cameras, you can also now view multiple cameras at the same time on the ‌Apple TV‌.

In-person Today at Apple sessions will no longer be resuming at this time, with Apple putting in-person classes off because of the ongoing rise of the Delta variant across the United States and other countries.

                    <span>Refurbished 24-inch M1 iMac models are now available from Apple&#x27;s refurbished store in the UK, just a few months after the machines first launched in April.





Right now, Apple has one 24-inch iMac available in a pink color, which was first spotted by 9to5Mac. The machine features an 8-core CPU, 7-core GPU, and 256GB SSD and it is priced at £1,059, a £190.00 savings over the standard £1,249 price.



Refurbished stock varies based on what people have sent in for repair and replacement, and additional ‌M1‌ ‌iMac‌ models will be available in the future. Those looking for a specific build or a specific color will need to keep an eye on the store to wait for their preferred version to pop up.



All of Apple&#x27;s refurbished Macs are sold with the same one-year warranty that&#x27;s offered with a new Mac, plus they come with all manuals and accessories, including a USB-C power adapter and cable. Apple&#x27;s refurbished devices are subjected to a rigorous testing, repair, repackaging and cleaning process to make them identical to new devices.



Categories for refurbished 24-inch iMacs have also shown up in the United States, so we can expect to see the refurbished ‌iMac‌ models available in other countries in the near future.

                    <span>Apple has developed a first-of-its-kind hydration sensor designed for the Apple Watch, a company patent filing has revealed.





The patent, first spotted by Patently Apple, is titled &quot;Hydration measurement with a watch&quot; and was granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.



&quot;Traditional techniques for tracking hydration are generally invasive, expensive, or unreliable,&quot; according to Apple. This refers to existing ways of determining hydration such as single-use tests of fluid samples.



Apple&#x27;s hydration sensor takes the form of non-invasive electrodes that are placed against the skin, which it describes as a &quot;reliable and elegant&quot; solution. The sensor works by measuring the electrical properties of the Apple Watch wearer&#x27;s sweat. The patent explains:

                    <span>Mastercard last week announced that its cards will no longer be issued with the magnetic stripe by 2029, which will presumably include Apple Card.





The magnetic stripe was an early 1960s technology that allowed card information to be encoded onto magnetic tape that is laminated to the back of a card, paving the way for electronic payment terminals and chip cards. Now, Mastercard is set to be the first payments network to phase out the magnetic stripe.



Starting in 2024, Mastercard credit and debit cards will not be required to feature a magnetic stripe in most markets, including Europe. Banks in the United States will no longer be required to issue cards with a magnetic stripe in 2027. Mastercard expects that the magnetic stripe will disappear in Europe most quickly, where …</span>

On August 1, select models of the Series 6 Edition with titanium were unavailable for delivery and/or pick-up. Now, all titanium models are unavailable for delivery or pick-up and can&#x27;t even be added to Apple&#x27;s online store bag.



The unavailability comes just weeks ahead of when we expect Apple to announce the Apple Watch Series 7 with a new design. Bloomberg&#x27;s Mark Gurman has speculated that the spotty lack of availability for the Apple Watch Edition earlier this month could entail Apple deciding to discontinue the higher-end lineup with the Series 7.



We&#x27;ve contacted Apple for comment and will let MacRumors&#x27; readers know if we hear back.

“We have determined that unauthorized access to some T-Mobile data
occurred, however we have not yet determined that there is any
personal customer data involved,” T-Mobile wrote in its new
announcement. “This investigation will take some time but we are
working with the highest degree of urgency. Until we have
completed this assessment we cannot confirm the reported number of
records affected or the validity of statements made by others,”
the announcement added.
The seller told Motherboard that 100 million people had their data
compromised in the breach. In the forum post, they were offering
data on 30 million people for 6 bitcoin, or around $270,000.

                    <span>This has easily been the longest sale we&#x27;ve ever had on Acorn - since March 17th!
But if you&#x27;ve been holding out on buying it for some reason, now is the time to purchase. The 50% off sale will end Monday, August 23rd, and the price will double from $19.99 up to $39.99 USD.
The bundle discount will still be available though. So if you buy multiple copies (or multiple apps), you can save some cash. Or buy now and save even more.</span>

The jersey ads are coming; whose money will the Flyers end up taking? 
 It leaked earlier today that, despite Gary Bettman’s assurances to the contrary last year, the NHL will finally give in to the corporate gods whose money and influence rules us all and sell advertising space on NHL jerseys for the upcoming season. 
From ESPN’s report on the story: 
The league’s board of governors formally voted this month to approve jersey advertisements. The NHL had surveyed its teams and found the majority of them in favor of jersey ads. The ads will be featured in a 3-inch-by-3.5-inch rectangle, which is larger than the NBA’s 2.5-by-2.5-inch space for uniform ads.

This is, of course, the second foray into selling advertising space on the players’…</span>

So long, farewell, etc, etc. 
 The time has come, folks. Lengthy, tumultuous, and often divisive, the Robert Hagg saga has come to an end in Philadelphia. As part of the return for Buffalo in the trade that brought Rasmus Ristolainen to the Flyers, this awful and messy 2020-21 season was Hagg’s last with them, and in a lot of ways it was a solid individual final showing, and serves as a positive endnote and send-off. 



Really, we’re not being snarky, we promise. Let’s break it down, shall we?
By The Numbers


Hagg’s not one that we’ve known to put up stellar scoring numbers, but he can chip in a bit of offense when push comes to shove. That said, his scoring pace was pretty well below the range of what we’ve seen from him in the past—i…</span>

The Imperium still stands, and man are they pissed
 Eve Online’s latest player-led war has come to an end, not with a bang but with a cavernous whimper. Those on the offense have turned tail, and the defenders are putting everything they have into running them down.
The massive coalition known as PAPI campaigned for 55 weeks in a quest to destroy The Imperium, led by Alex “The Mittani” Gianturco, before losing the will to fight. Along the way, Eve Online developer CCP Games told Polygon, combatants destroyed more than $3 million worth of in-game ships and virtual infrastructure in the conflict dubbed World War Bee 2.
“This is as real as real talk gets,” said Brave Collective’s Dunk Dinkle in a live address to his fleets, in what amounted to PAPI’s conces…</span>

A bug that caused a bug
 “Hey, you’re finally awake ...” and now being catapulted to the moon thanks to a very strong bee.
Former Bethesda developer Nate Purkeypile posted a Twitter thread on Tuesday describing a notorious bug — an actual bug, at least in-game — that caused major problems during The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim’s development. Purkeypile described the introductory scene in Skyrim where the player wakes up in the back of a cart with other prisoners. It’s where the famous “You’re finally wake” meme originated — but it’s also remembered by the developer for a catastrophic collision. 
So, I have a story about the Skyrim Intro and how hard game development is.
That intro is famous now, but back then, it was just that one thing …</span>

A meticulously paced disciple of Metroid
 Axiom Verge 2 is a Metroidvania game for people who hate the term “Metroidvania.” Thomas Happ Games’ second outing has a purist’s view of the genre built by Metroid that feels like a refreshing change of pace in a sea of imitators. More importantly, while its meticulously paced exploration and upgrade loops are a little too close to its inspiration at times, it’s the way Axiom Verge 2 digs into the isolation at the heart of the Metroid series that makes it stand out.
Axiom Verge 2 strands you on the cold, mysterious world of Kiengir and cuts right to the chase. You don’t know what’s going on or what anyone else is doing here, but you’re bent on going back to Earth. So you …</span>

No release date was given, but it is expected to arrive soon
 Cyberpunk 2077’s next big patch, labeled 1.3, is on the way. On Tuesday, developer CD Projekt Red released a complete set of patch notes detailing fixes for 85 quests and gigs, plus improvements and balance changes throughout the game. The developer said the free update is headed to consoles, PC, and Stadia soon but declined to provide a release date.
In addition to the quality of life changes detailed on Monday, the 1.3 patch appears to be a substantial one. CD Projekt is also including a few of what it is calling “free DLCs.” They will take the form of additional cosmetic items for the player character, quest options, phone texts, and animations. Several of those DLCs were teased during a Twitch livestream, and a complete list will be included in the Main Menu under “Additional Content” heading.
Senior level designer Miles Tost was on hand during today’s Twitch stream to speak to the complexity of the issues that his colleagues are dealing with. He likened this and other patches to “open heart surgery.”


Cyberpunk 2077 launched in a sorry state in December, with many bugs and quality issues across every platform on which it was released. Though it quickly recouped its development costs, it was a source of embarrassment for the company’s leadership, which chose to accept the blame and apologize to fans and investors. The game was even delisted from the PlayStation Store shortly after launch, only to return in June of this year. It has yet to release for current generation consoles, including the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X, where it is only playable in compatibility mode.


Cyberpunk 2077’s most recent major patch, version 1.23, went live in June. You can read the full 1.3 patch notes at the game’s official website.</span>

Eat your heart out, Garo Yepremian
 Super Slam Dunk Touchdown, Rick Felice’s empty-the-garage mashup of sporting goods and athletes, at last launches on Xbox One on Aug. 27. This version, teased as far back as GDC 2017, brings along a new Season Mode that supports local cooperative play with up to three players.
“Now you and your friends can create a team, build a fan base, win trophies, and discover secrets, multiple endings, and 100 achievements along the way,” Felice said. An update for the Windows PC version is coming soon; it will support cloud saves, remote play, and the 100 new achievements, too.

This is Epic Games’ second crack at a hidden role mode
 Fortnite has another new Among Us-style mode and this time its a lot closer to its inspiration. Epic revealed the new mode on Tuesday, as part of Fortnite’s latest patch.
The new limited time mode is called Impostors, and it features 10 players — eight Agents and two Impostors — in each match. All 10 players are aboard The Bridge on the island (also like Among Us). The Agents are trying to complete tasks that will help them arrive at their destination safely; Impostors try to eliminate the Agents without having their identity discovered. Whenever things seem a little too suspicious, or when player’s body is found, all the remaining players convene to discuss who the Impostor might be.

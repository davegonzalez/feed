                    <span>A longstanding challenge for climate coverage is that climate change is so big, so all-encompassing, that journalists sometimes struggle with where to start. That can go double for local journalists, whose scope is necessarily hyperfocused. The climate story threads together megacorporations, heads of state, our forests, the oceans, and even what’s for dinner. For outlets […]</span>

                    <span>In these tantalizingly short videos, legendary producer Butch Vig details how the songs on Nirvana’s 1991 breakthrough album Nevermind came together. About Smells Like Teen Spirit, Vig says:
Here comes the guitar solo. He basically copied the vocal melody instead of trying to come up with something punky or frantic or strangled guitar like he usually did. He just copied the exact vocal melody and it works really well.


You can find the breakdowns for Teen Spirit and Drain You embedded above and here are Something In The Way, In Bloom, and Polly. Bonus: Vig describes hearing Smells Like Teen Spirit in person for the first time. (via open culture)

                    <span>Korean artist Lee Sangsoo makes these minimalist yet expressive sculptures of animals, people, and objects. And they’re perhaps larger than you expect.


I know I’ve said this probably 100 times before, but I’m continually amazed at how, with just a few strokes of a brush or twists of metal, an artist can create something that’s both abstract and familiar. That beige and brown sculpture above…my brain took about 0.03 seconds to recognize that as a siamese cat. Artists hacking the human brain’s pattern recognition ability and us being delighted by it is the gift that keeps on giving. (via colossal)

                    <span>For his new book, The Every, Dave Eggers and art director Sunra Thompson are doing 32 separate covers, with more to come “in perpetuity”.
Never one to shy away from pushing boundaries, Eggers teamed up with art director Sunra Thompson for the project, who discovered that the dust jacket printer they were using could run several cover designs on one sheet of paper at once, providing the means to print dozens of different versions at the same time. Thompson decided to exploit this printing feature, enlisting a boatload of artists to design a completely new version of The Every cover.


The hardcover version of the book featuring the 32+ designs will only be available on the McSweeney’s website and in independent bookstores, which doesn’t seem to include Bookshop.org. Amazon, says Eggers, can go pound sand.
“I don’t like bullies,” Eggers wrote in an email. “Amazon has been kicking sand in the face of independent bookstores for decades now.”
The novel follows a former forest ranger and tech skeptic, Delaney Wells, as she tries to take down a dangerous monopoly from the inside: a company called The Every, formed when the world’s most powerful e-commerce site merged with the biggest social media company/search engine.
“One of the themes of the book is the power of monopolies to dictate our choices, so it seemed a good opportunity to push back a bit against the monopoly, Amazon, that currently rules the book world,” he said. “So we started looking into how feasible it would be to make the hardcover available only through independent bookstores. Turns out it is very, very hard.”

                    <span>The latest installment in the excellent Almost Famous series from the NY Times and Ben Proudfoot is about Devon Michael, who as a young actor was almost chosen to play Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.
Growing up, Michael had small roles in commercials, television shows and movies. At 9 years old, he understood that an opportunity like “Star Wars” could change his life. From 3,000, the producers narrowed it down to three, and soon Michael was at Skywalker Ranch doing a test screen with George Lucas and Natalie Portman.


It’s pretty poignant listening to Michael talk about the disappointment and disillusionment that followed his not getting chosen, as well as a different kind of hardship for Jake Lloyd, who was picked for the role.

                    <span>Back in April, Ransomware group REvil attacked Apple supplier Quanta Computer and was able to steal schematics outlining the design of the 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro models that were announced earlier this week.





The schematics did indeed leak the design of the new machines, and at the time, REvil threatened to release other documents should Apple not pay a ransom fee of $50 million by May 1. The situation fizzled out just days later, and REvil mysteriously removed all documents and extortion threats related to Apple from its website.



We&#x27;ve heard nothing further about REvil&#x27;s attack on Apple since then, but it turns out there was a multi-country operation underway to take down the ransomware group. According to Reuters, several government agencies teamed up to hack REvil and take it offline this week.
One person familiar with the events said that a foreign partner of the U.S. government carried out the hacking operation that penetrated REvil&#x27;s computer architecture. A former U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the operation is still active.
REvil&#x27;s &quot;Happy Blog&quot; that was used to leak stolen documents has been taken offline and is no longer available. The hacker group went offline back in July as well after law enforcement and intelligence specialists were able to hack into REvil&#x27;s computer network, but it returned last month and servers previously compromised by the government were again used for this second takedown.



REvil was also responsible for a May cyberattack on the Colonial Pipeline that caused gas shortages on the East Coast of the United States.

                    <span>Apple is facing yet another investigation by U.S. regulators, this time from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The CFPB, which is investigating the business practices of companies operating payment systems, today announced that it has asked Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon, PayPal, and Square to provide details on their consumer data practices.





The CFPB is seeking information that will help it better understand how the tech companies &quot;use personal payments data and manage data access to users&quot; to make sure consumers are protected.

                    <span>With the Apple event this week and the imminent launch of new MacBook Pro models, it&#x27;s easy to forget that the Apple Watch Series 7 just came out last Friday. iFixit didn&#x27;t forget, though, and has done one of its traditional teardowns on Apple&#x27;s newest wrist-worn device.



Today&#x27;s teardown features both the 41 and 45mm versions of the watch, and it unveils some secrets we weren&#x27;t previously aware of. The 45mm ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ has a 1.189Wh battery inside (309 mAh), which is a 1.6 percent increase over the 1.17Wh battery in the 44mm Series 6.

It will come in color options that are similar to the 24-inch iMac, which we&#x27;ve heard rumored before. According to the leaker, the keyboard will be the same off-white shade as the bezels, and it will feature full-size function keys and a 1080p webcam.

16-inch MacBook Pro models configured with the M1 Max chip feature a new High Power Mode to maximize performance for intensive, sustained workloads, according to Apple. High Power Mode is not available on other models.


Like the Pro Display XDR, the new MacBook Pro displays have a peak brightness of 500 nits for standard aka SDR content, according to Apple. The new MacBook Pro&#x27;s advertised 1,600 nits of peak full-screen brightness is for HDR content only.

                    <span>The new 16-inch MacBook Pro with the M1 Max Apple Silicon chip will feature a new High Power Mode for intensive, sustained workloads, according to Apple.





MacRumors contributor Steve Moser discovered references to High Power Mode in the macOS Monterey beta, and we&#x27;ve now confirmed with Apple that this feature will indeed be included on the highest-end configurations of the new machine.



This new setting is the opposite of &quot;Low Power Mode,&quot; which aims to decrease system performance to prolong battery life. The new mode will only be available on the 16-inch MacBook Pro with the M1 Max chip, not the 14-inch model or models with the M1 Pro. 



Text within the macOS Monterey beta reads, &quot;Your Mac will optimize performance to better support resource-intensive tasks. This may result in louder fan noise.&quot; The new mode is not likely to be used in typical work cases, but instead when users may be rendering larger files or graphically intensive tasks that require an added boost of performance. 



The new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros both include improved thermal architecture, but Apple says the new and improved fans are not likely to be used by most users in day-to-day use. Geekbench scores of Apple&#x27;s newest high-end M1 Max Apple Silicon chip show that it&#x27;s over 3x times faster than the M1 chip in the MacBook Pro in GPU tasks. In multi-core performance, the M1 Max is up to 2x faster than M1.

                    <span>With the launch of iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, Apple introduced a new App Store feature that&#x27;s designed to highlight in-app events, allowing customers to keep up with new happenings in their favorite apps.





Apple is preparing to implement in-app events, and today called on developers to start creating in-app events in ‌App Store‌ Connect.



In-app events can highlight in-game competitions, movie premieres, livestream experiences, fitness challenges, and more. Apple says that in-app events can encourage people to try out apps, provide existing users with new ways to enjoy an app, and give former users a reason to return.



Events will start appearing in the ‌App Store‌ on devices running ‌iOS 15‌ and ‌iPadOS 15‌ on Wednesday, October 27.



The update could be timed to the iOS and iPadOS 15.1 release, which is coming next week. Apple has confirmed that macOS Monterey is coming on Monday, October 25, but it is not yet clear if the iOS and iPadOS 15.1 updates will come on the same day or later in the week, such as on the 27th.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/21/google-lowers-play-store-subscription-fee/">

                    <span>After lowering its Play Store commission from 30 percent to 15 percent in March, Google today announced that it is making the same change to subscription fees, an update applicable to all app developers, reports The Verge.





At the current time, Google&#x27;s subscription policy works like Apple&#x27;s. Google collects 30 percent from a subscription during the first year, and then drops that to 15 percent for each subsequent year if customers keep a continuous subscription going.



Google recognizes that many businesses are unable to benefit from the fee cut because of the continuous rule that it has, so Google is dropping all subscription fees to 15 percent &quot;from day one,&quot; effectively removing prior year-long subscription requirement. The fee cut was also previously limited to the first $1 million in revenue.



Apple also offers reduced 15 percent subscription fees from day one, but that&#x27;s limited to developers who are part of its App Store Small Business Program, which is available to those who earn up to but don’t exceed to $1 million in a calendar year. For other developers that are not part of that program, Apple takes a 30 percent cut until a subscriber has been subscribed to a service for 12 months. 



All apps in the Google Play Store will pay 15 percent instead of 30 percent for all subscriptions, but Google also plans to lower the fee even further for some ebooks and on-demand streaming music service apps. Fees could be as low as 10 percent for apps that fall into these categories.



Google is making the change to subscription fees as it faces increased regulatory pressure much like Apple. It too is in the same legal battle over in-app purchases as Apple with Epic Games, and it is under the same scrutiny in the United States and other countries.

Haven&#x27;t seen anyone show this but perhaps there&#x27;s a 6% cash back promo Apple hasn&#x27;t announced yet? I just hope this isn&#x27;t a bug 😂 Didn&#x27;t apply to my AirPods 3 so possibly if you spend over a certain amount they go to 6%? pic.twitter.com/PVc8sDsshF

Pre-orders for the new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros opened this week, and Apple could possibly be running the promotion as a way to incentivize customers with the pre-ordering the latest MacBook Pros, and other products and accessories. We&#x27;ve contacted Apple for more information and will update if we hear back.

                    <span>T-Mobile today announced that, starting October 22, it will pay off a qualifying customer&#x27;s remaining eligible smartphone payments up to $1,000 via virtual prepaid MasterCard when they switch to the carrier in the United States.





The limited time offer is designed to allow customers to switch from their current carrier to T-Mobile and continue using their existing smartphone without cost. T-Mobile has more details available on its website, including instructions for customers looking to switch from Verizon, AT&amp;T, U.S. Cellular, and select other carriers.



The steps on T-Mobile&#x27;s website include verifying your smartphone is an eligible device, submitting screenshot proof of your current device payment plan balance, ordering a T-Mobile SIM card and choosing a plan, and submitting a rebate claim. The prepaid MasterCard can then be used to pay off the remaining device balance at your previous carrier.



Fine print indicates that a credit check and an eligible T-Mobile plan is required. The smartphone must be unlocked before being ported in to T-Mobile.

                    <span>Apple has confirmed to The Verge&#x27;s Dan Seifert that the SD card slot built into the new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models supports UHS-II, and while this could theoretically allow for read and write speeds of up to 312MB/s with USH-II SD cards, Apple has since confirmed that the reader supports up to 250MB/s of data transfer.





Some people had hoped that the SD card slot would support UHS-III with read and write speeds up to 624 MB/s, but this is not the case.



Users can take advantage of the SD card slot for additional storage space, with UHS-II-compliant SD cards available in capacities such as 64GB, 128GB, and 256GB.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Nvidia today announced the launch of a new higher-tier membership for its streaming gaming platform GeForce NOW, allowing gamers to get access to improved performance.





According to Nvidia, the GeForce NOW RTX 3080 membership provides gamers with access to the &quot;greatest-ever generational leap in GeForce history,&quot; offering up the highest resolutions and fastest frame rates, plus low latency. Nvidia says the new gaming experience rivals the latest game consoles.



Each GeForce NOW cloud SuperPOD includes more than 1000 GPUs that deliver over 39 petaflops of graphics horsepower. Nvidia says each instance is 35 teraflops of performance, nearly 3x that of an Xbox Series X.



With the new membership tier, games can run at up to 1440p on Macs and PCs, and at up to 120 frames per second.



Access to the GeForce NOW RTX 3080 membership is priced at $99.99 for six months, which is introductory pricing. GeForce NOW founders and Priority members have early access to pre-order starting today, and pre-orders will open more broadly to all gamers later in the month. Quantities are limited.



At $99.99 for six months, access to the RTX 3080 rigs costs twice as much as the $49.99 priority membership. Those who choose the highest-tier plan get longer session allowances in addition to the higher quality streaming.



GeForce NOW offers several free games, but for the most part, titles need to be purchased to be played. GeForce NOW provides the gaming platform, but gamers need to supply their own games.

                    <span>Apple device shortages threaten to undercut what could otherwise be a record-setting holiday season for the company, reports Bloomberg&#x27;s Mark Gurman.





Not long after Apple&#x27;s iPhone 13 launch in September, shipping estimates for all models began slipping by several weeks. This trend was replicated for the iPad mini, ninth-generation iPad, Apple Watch Series 7, and most recently, Apple&#x27;s new MacBook Pro models, all of which now show delivery times running into November or December. Even Apple&#x27;s much-derided $19 polishing cloth is sold out until late next month.



Shipping delays for new Apple products aren&#x27;t a new phenomenon, but several relatively older Apple products have been experiencing delayed shipping times since the first half of September, including the iPhone 11, iPh…</span>

                    <span>Apple Music subscribers who use Windows 11 and dislike accessing the service through iTunes or their browser can now run the ‌Apple Music‌ Android app on their desktop, thanks to the first preview release of Android apps support.

Microsoft released Windows 11 earlier this month, but its promised support for side-loading Android apps was delayed. That just got one step closer, however, with the first preview of the support now available to testers in the Beta Channel version of Windows 11, which means interested users need to opt into the Windows Insider program to gain access.



As it&#x27;s a preview release, Microsoft has limited the number of Android apps that can be run on Windows 11, and has partnered with Amazon to make around 50 apps on the Amazon Appstore available to download and install. ‌Apple Music‌ isn&#x27;t available on Amazon&#x27;s Appstore, but it is possible to run the app using the app&#x27;s APK and the Windows Subsystem for Android.



The process is a little convoluted for casual users, but for anyone who is not a fan of iTunes and doesn&#x27;t like running ‌Apple Music‌ through a browser, it should provide a nice alternative.

                    <span>Late last month, Apple issued an unusual standalone software update to macOS users called &quot;Device Support Update,&quot; which it said was to &quot;ensure proper updating and restoring for iOS and iPadOS devices with Mac.&quot; 





While no other details were provided, it was assumed that the update added support for recently released devices, including iPhone 13 models, the new iPad mini, and the ninth-generation iPad. Still, the update was the first of its kind to come through System Preferences -&gt; Software Update, which made some users curious about it.

                    <span>AppleCare+ for the new 16-inch MacBook Pro is priced at $399, which is a $20 increase over the cost of ‌AppleCare‌ for the prior-generation 16-inch model. ‌AppleCare‌+ for the 14-inch MacBook Pro is priced at $279, which is a $10 increase over the cost of ‌AppleCare‌+ for the prior-generation 13-inch Intel machine. 





Those who are picking up one of the new M1 Pro or ‌M1‌ Max MacBook Pro models may want to consider ‌AppleCare‌+ given the high price of the machines and the fact that they are the first generation of a new design, which can sometimes lead to issues. 



‌AppleCare‌+ adds three years of coverage to a MacBook Pro, along with protection from two incidents of accidental damage very 12 months. For accidental damage, a deductible must be paid, but for manufacturing issues, Apple will cover repairs at no cost. 



While ‌AppleCare‌+ is priced at $279/$399 for the new Macs, there are also renewable annual payments available at $150 for the 16-inch machine or $100 for the 14-inch machine, which will continue to be available until cancelled. Apple also allows Apple Card customers to pay ‌AppleCare‌+ fees in monthly installments. 



Apple has not provided details on what it will cost to repair a 14 or 16-inch MacBook Pro outside of the warranty period and with no ‌AppleCare‌+. ‌AppleCare‌+ can be purchased when buying a new MacBook Pro or within 60 days of receiving one of the new machines.

                    <span>5 years ago I wrote a post called how to ask good questions.
I still really like that post, but it’s missing a few of the tactics I use to
get useful answers like “interrupt people when they’re going off on an
irrelevant tangent”.
what can go wrong when asking questions
Often when I ask a vague or underspecified question, what happens is one of:
the person starts by explaining a bunch of stuff I already know
the person explains some things which I don’t know, but which I don’t think
are relevant to my problem
the person starts giving a relevant explanation, but using terminology that
I don’t understand, so I still end up being confused
None of these give me the answer to my question and this can be quite
frustrating (it often feels condescending when someone embarks on a lengthy
explanatio…</span>

Some observations for your morning…
 The Flyers are rolling! After picking up a pretty decisive win over the Kraken on Monday, the Bruins came to town last night, and the Flyers had themselves their toughest matchup of the season on deck. It wasn’t their tidiest win across the board, there certainly were some hiccups, but the Flyers kept their heads down and made the most of their chances, and they were able to cruise to a 6-3 win on the night. Let’s break this one down, shall we?

Flyers got buried by chances

It was....less than optimal.
 Following a convincing victory in which the Flyers defeated a hapless and Hakstol’ed Seattle Kraken 6-1, the Flyers once again put half-a-dozen goals past their opponents in front of an energetic Wells Fargo Center crowd. 
This time around, against a much hated rival in the Boston Bruins, key performances by Cam Atkinson, Keith Yandle, and Joel Farabee saw the Flyers defeat the Bruins 6-3, with a Martin Jones start in goal not bringing as much foreseeable doom as one may have anticipated. 
While the Bruins controlled this game for its entirety from a possession and shooting perspective (including a lot of net-front chances), the Flyers were clinical and took advantage of the opportunities that came their way…</span>

 *The Flyers beat the Boston Bruins handily, on national TV, with their backup goaltender in net. We are officially having fun out here. Who else is having fun out here?! RECAP!!
*It was debut night for new guy Rasmus Ristolainen and newer guy Zack MacEwan. Team’s starting to fill out. [NBC Sports Philly]
*Speaking of new guys, Cam Atkinson is making a case for the most impactful addition so far huh? He and Farabee are a breath of fresh air out there. [BSH]
*Always good to keep an eye on what the rest of the division is up to. [Canes Country]
*Lots of goalies switched teams this summer which means lots of teams are still getting to know their new goaltender. [FiveThirtyRight]
*And finally (no dang links on game days fam), a brand new BSH Radio is out there for you, in case you didn’t know. It’s excellent, of course. Please enjoy. [BSH]</span>

We celebrate the Sixers’ season-opening win with a Flyers victory.
 Hello everyone and welcome to our first ever round of Jones or No Jones, the game where we find out if the Philadelphia Flyers’ newly acquired 31-year-old goaltender Martin Jones is going to play like he did in the first half of his career or the second half, and as a result we find out what kind of day we’re going to have following a Flyers game. So frequently in hockey, a goalie’s performance can decide a game’s fate, and while it didn’t seem like an exceptional game from Jones, who’s coming off three consecutive poor seasons for the San Jose Sharks and a very shaky preseason, he did make 37 saves on 40 shots against what projects to be a tough Boston Bruins team. So? It’s a J…</span>

Outer Wilds: Echoes of the Eye imagines a world fit for Master Chief — minus all the targets
 I’ve given up hope of getting the one thing I want from the Halo franchise. Microsoft has put together over a dozen Halo games and spin-offs, a small mountain of books, and a soon-to-be-released TV show, but it still hasn’t made a Halo game that would invite me to explore a grand, open, complete ringworld. You know: a Halo game about a halo.
This year, I finally got exactly what I’d wanted from the last place I expected to find it: a barely promoted expansion to an indie game.
Warning, reader! I’m about to spoil the first couple hours of Outer Wilds: Echoes of the Eye. If you care deeply about Polygon’s 2019 Game of the Year, I encourage you to keep…</span>

ConcernedApe’s Haunted Chocolatier revealed on YouTube
 Eric “ConcernedApe” Barone, the developer behind the massively successful farming simulator, Stardew Valley announced his next game via his YouTube channel on Thursday. 
The game is called Haunted Chocolatier, and from the looks of it, it will allow you to run a giant chocolate factory. The stream showed a character walking through a set of double doors towards a mountain, exploring woods, and then teased a clip of shop that employs a ghost as a cashier. Although the game looks looks very similar to Stardew Valley, the creator clarified in a Tweet that Haunted Chocolatier is its own separate game (and not an update to Stardew).
Stardew Valley follows a character who inherits a plot of land and quits their office job to pursue farming. Although the game largely involves planting and growing crops, it has a big world where you mine, fish, and even date and marry the local townspeople.
Since its initial release in 2016, Stardew Valley has undergone a series of significant updates that added new crops, new islands to explore, as well as features like local multiplayer. The game has an avid modding community behind it, and has even inspired a board game.</span>

Start ejecting imposters from the comfort of your couch
 Among Us is finally heading to Xbox and PlayStation on Dec. 14, the Dual Wield Studio and Innersloth teams announced Thursday morning. Among Us will run on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X this holiday. The game is already available on the Google Play store, the iOS App Store, Steam, itch.io, Switch, the Epic Games Store, and the Windows Store.
In addition to the Xbox and PlayStation versions of Among Us, fans can pick up a physical copy of the extremely popular social deduction game. Among Us’ Crewmate Edition, which comes with a physical disc or cartridge, some downloadable wallpapers, stickers, a Skeld map poster, a holographic access card, and all the DLC, runs fans $29.99. It will launch in Europe and the UK on Dec. 14, Japan and South Korea on Dec. 16, and the US, Canada, and Latin America on Jan. 11, 2022.
The Imposter Edition costs $49.99, and the Ejected Edition is $89.99, and it launches in Spring 2022. The Imposter edition includes everything in the Crewmate Edition, plus a “Spinning Into Space” enamel pin, a lanyard, and a purple crewmate plush, complete with crown. The Ejected Edition is the Imposter Edition plus an exclusive steelbook case, an Among Us-themed blanket, and red imposter beanie.
Among Us, which launched in 2018 but became a sensation during pandemic gaming last year, has been one of the biggest games in the world for over a year now, and you can finally put it on your shelf — just in time for the holidays.</span>

Fan-favorite C.A.R. SMG shows up alongside Ash
 Where is Apex Legends headed, anyway, for its next season? Well, there’s a desert island, and a Mirage …
And there’s trouble in paradise. Escape, the 11th season of Apex, begins Nov. 2., and if you’re thinking “Wait a minute, isn’t this theme more suited to the summer,” well, guess again. Things turn appropriately scary once Ash, the newest playable Legend, shows up and commences with the nonchalant stabbings. The spider horde trailing behind suggests there’ll be some light PvE on the new map coming to the game, too.
And, oh yeah, let’s not forget the weapon Mirage picks up. That is indeed the C.A.R. submachine gun, which data miners found mention of back in the summer (a subsequent patch removed all textual mention of it). Like Ash, the C.A.R. is also a throwback retrieved from Titanfall 2. Fans there found it extremely reliable (for its consistent recoil) and its 30-round clip plenty useful. Looks like it should match that performance in Apex Legends in a couple of weeks.
We still don’t know exactly what the new map is; the official announcement page says only “a storm is brewing.” Sounds like players can find out more when the gameplay trailer goes up on Monday, Oct. 25.</span>

                    <span>For his YouTube channel Listening In, Barnaby Martin analyzed the theme that Radiohead wrote for the 2015 Bond film Spectre, a song that he calls “one of the greatest Bond themes ever written”. Somewhat notoriously (at least around these parts), the producers rejected this theme in favor of a lukewarm by Sam Smith.
After watching Martin’s video, you should watch the Spectre opening credits sequence with the Radiohead theme — it’s so much better than the theme they used in the film.

                    <span>Ahhhh, The Verge has published an excerpt of Tamara Shopsin’s LaserWriter II, “a coming-of-age tale set in the legendary 90s indie NYC Mac repair shop TekServe — a voyage back in time to when the internet was new, when New York City was gritty, and when Apple made off-beat computers for weirdos”.
Joel explains that the LaserWriter II was discontinued almost ten years ago. But Tek always encourages people to fix them. Always. LaserWriter IIs are tanks, one of the most solid printers Apple ever made. The printer has only one design flaw, one thing that consistently breaks, and that flaw takes ten years to surface. Joel pauses for breath. Claire is on the edge of her seat.
He concludes, “The fan blades warp a little over time and suck in dust. This dust eventually gets into the optics and causes pages to ghost.”
Claire prints a test page from the LaserWriter II. The edges of the paper are bright white. They stipple to a black stripe of text in the center, in a kind of reverse ice cream sandwich.
Ghosting is a term used to cover a host of printing problems — double images, an image seen through the backside of the paper. Here Joel uses “ghost” to describe printing so faint it has not actually printed.


I recommend reading LaserWriter II, as well as Shopsin’s memoir Arbitrary Stupid Goal.

                    <span>Using samples of chopped-down wood left behind by Viking explorers at their settlement in Newfoundland and known chemical markers of powerful solar storms in 993 AD, a group of scientists has determined the exact timing of the first-known visit of Europeans to North America: 1021 AD. If you’re keeping score at home, that’s 471 years before Columbus.
A team of scientists looked at wood found at the L’Anse aux Meadows Viking site. In three cases the trees had been physically cut down, and moreover, they were clearly cut with metal tools — Vikings had metal implements at the time, but indigenous people did not. The wood was all from different trees (one was fir, and another juniper, for example). The key parts here are that the wood was all from trees that had been alive for many decades, and all had their waney edge intact as well.
The scientists extracted 127 samples from the wood, and 83 rings were examined. They used two methods to secure dates. The first was to compare the amount of carbon-14 in each ring with known atmospheric amounts from the time. This gives a rough date for the waney edge of the wood. They also then looked for an anomalous spike in carbon-14 in an inner ring, knowing this would have come from the 993 A.D. event, and then simply counted the rings outward from there to get the date of the waney edge.
In all three samples the waney edge was dated to the same year: 1021 A.D. This would be incredibly unlikely to occur at random.


Outstanding science. It’s incredible how much of a time machine these analysis tools are. There’s so much we don’t know about people who lived 1000 years ago, but it’s astounding that we know anything at all, particularly precise dates like this.

                    <span>Oh, I’m excited for this one. I’m not saying The Great was the best show I’ve seen over the past couple of years, but it’s definitely one of the most fun and enjoyable. A synopsis:
The Great is a satirical, comedic drama about the rise of Catherine the Great from outsider to the longest reigning female ruler in Russia’s history. A fictionalized, fun and anachronistic story of an idealistic, romantic young girl, who arrives in Russia for an arranged marriage to the mercurial Emperor Peter. Hoping for love and sunshine, she finds instead a dangerous, depraved, backward world that she resolves to change. All she has to do is kill her husband, beat the church, baffle the military and get the court onside.


The Great was created by Tony McNamara, who co-wrote The Favourite — both have the same punchy, ribald dialogue. You can catch up on season one on Hulu while we wait for the season two premiere on Nov 19.

                    <span>Apple corporate employees who are unvaccinated or who have not shared their vaccination status with Apple will need to undergo a COVID-19 test each time they come into the office, reports Bloomberg.





An employee going into the office on a daily basis would need to be tested each day of the week under the new rules. Apple is still stopping short of implementing a vaccine mandate that would require employees to be vaccinated to return to the office. Apple corporate employees that have been vaccinated will need to do a rapid test once per week.



As for retail staff, unvaccinated employees will need to test twice per week instead of on a daily basis, and vaccinated retail employees will need to take a rapid test once per week.



Employees submitting to testing will be able to use at-home rapid tests that can be picked up from Apple&#x27;s corporate offices and retail stores. Tests take 15 minutes and require employees to self-report the results.



Many other tech companies have implemented vaccine mandates, which Apple has declined to do so far, but as Bloomberg points out, Apple may soon need to change its rules. The Biden administration is requiring all federal contractors to require their employees to be vaccinated by December 8, and Apple sells products to the government.



Apple has asked employees to provide their vaccination status by October 24, and they&#x27;ll also need to provide proof in the near future. The new testing requirements go into effect on November 1.



Apple is now planning for employees to return to the office at least three days per week starting in January.

                    <span>The $19 &quot;Polishing Cloth&quot; that Apple introduced alongside the 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro models has proven to be wildly popular, and it is now sold out until the end of December/early January.





Orders placed today have delivery estimates ranging from December 20 to January 17, so those who hoped to purchase one for use with their new MacBook Pro or another Apple device will need to wait for two to three months.



Made from a &quot;soft, nonabrasive material,&quot; the cloth is suitable for Apple displays, including the nano-texture glass of the Pro Display XDR. It can also be used with the mini-LED display of the new MacBook Pro models and all of Apple&#x27;s iPhones, iPads, and Macs.



As of right now, the Polishing Cloth is available exclusively from the online store, and it is not available in Apple&#x27;s retail locations or from third-party companies. Apple may potentially start selling the cloth in stores at some point, but for now, those hoping for a cloth will need to wait patiently.

                    <span>Apple&#x27;s product design has improved since former design chief Jony Ive left the company in 2019, according to an opinion column by Bloomberg reporter Alex Webb.





Webb believes that Apple has reemphasized function over form since Ive&#x27;s departure. For example, while the design of the previous Siri Remote for the Apple TV made it easy to pick up the remote upside down by accident, a new Siri Remote was released in May with an improved design and added power and mute buttons for a TV.



There&#x27;s also the new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models this week, which feature the return of several ports that Apple had removed in 2016, including an HDMI port, an SD card slot, and MagSafe. Function over form certainly applies here, as the new MacBook Pro models are slightly thicker and …</span>

                    <span>Known for its range of battery pack options and other Apple accessories, Hyper just recently launched its newest products, the HyperJuice 245W USB-C Battery Pack and 245W GaN charger.





Hyper says that the 245W GaN Charger and Battery Pack are more powerful than four 61W chargers because at 245W, it&#x27;s capable of charging up to four laptops at the same time.



The Battery Pack features four 100W USB-C ports and it can provide a maximum of 245W for various devices. So you can charge four 61W MacBook Pro models all at the same time, or do a 16-inch MacBook Pro, an iPad, an iPhone, and another accessory all at full charging speeds.



It&#x27;s a 100Wh battery so though it provides up to 245W, it can still be brought on an airplane. The Battery Pack has enough juice to charge a MacBook Pro or MacBook Air up to two times with 27,000mAh capacity.





A built-in OLED display lets you know your battery status, providing real-time battery information like charging status, capacity, time to recharge, and the power being drawn from each port.



With the 245W GaN charger or any 100W USB-C PD charger, the battery pack can be charged up in as little as an hour.



Hyper is offering the new products on Indiegogo, and pricing for the battery pack starts at $149, while pricing on the 245W GaN charger starts at $99. A combo deal is available with Hyper offering both the battery pack and charger for $239.

                    <span>Apple today informed developers about a Tech Talks 2021 venture, which will allow developers to connect with Apple experts in more than 100 live online sessions and 1,500 available office hour appointments.





Apple says that developers can use the sessions to dive into technical content, get answers to questions, and seek one-on-one meetings for guidance. Sessions will be held online from Apple locations around the world in multiple time zones, including Bengaluru, India; Cupertino, California; London; Mexico City; São Paulo; Seoul, South Korea; Shanghai; Singapore; Sydney; Tel Aviv, Israel; and Tokyo.
&quot;Every single day, developers around the world are creating incredible apps and games for our platforms, and it&#x27;s our goal to provide them with every resource we can to help make the hard work they put in that much easier and more impactful,&quot; said Susan Prescott, Apple&#x27;s vice president of Worldwide Developer Relations. &quot;Our team is looking forward to connecting with even more developers around the world so we can better support the important work of this incredibly valued community, and listen to and learn from them.&quot;

Live sessions will provide developers with details on how to integrate the latest technologies into their apps, while 30 minute office hour sessions can be used to make app improvements, design revisions, and bug fixes.



Tech Talks will take place from October 25 to December 17, and developers can register for sessions and submit office hour requests starting today. The first Tech Talks will start on October 25 and new sessions and office hours will be posted every two weeks.

                    <span>Bonhams today announced that it will be auctioning several rare prototype Apple devices on November 3, including an unreleased VideoPad.





The VideoPad was intended to be a personal digital assistant (PDA) device similar to Apple&#x27;s Newton MessagePad series, with Apple testing three versions of the device between 1993 and 1995, including the VideoPad 1, VideoPad 2, and VideoPad 3, according to Bonhams. The auction company says the VideoPad 2 headed to auction is the only surviving concept prototype, and it is estimated to fetch up to $12,000.



The three VideoPad prototypes were based on a conceptual design sketch drawn by Apple&#x27;s former CEO John Sculley, but the devices were ultimately scrapped by Steve Jobs upon his return to Apple in the late 1990s, according to Bonhams.





The prototype VideoPad 2 features a hinged flip-top design with two screens, although the top screen appears to be missing. The device was apparently going to have a built-in camera for video conferencing, two speakers, a memory card slot, a power socket, and a phone line input, but it was ultimately never released to the public.



The prototype was purchased from an Apple engineer in Palo Alto in 1999, and it comes in its original black leather carrying case with the Newton logo, according to Bonhams. More details are available on the auction website.



Also headed to auction is an early prototype of the original Macintosh, an early prototype of the original iPad, and a handwritten letter from Steve Jobs.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Twelve South today launched the PowerPic Mod Wireless Charger ($59.99), which is a Qi-enabled charging stand that doubles as a picture frame. Unlike the previous model, the new device is made of a magnetic lucite frame, which detaches to fit any 4x6 photo.





The frame can be positioned vertically or horizontally, and it will require a 20W USB-C power adapter, which is not included. The accessory can charge any smartphone that supports Qi charging, as well as devices like the AirPods Pro.



Similar to the previous model, the idea behind the PowerPic Mod is to hide a wireless charger within an unassuming piece of home decor. Twelve South says that the device works well on desks, bedside tables, and in kitchens.








The PowerPic Mod will charge at 7.5W max speed for Apple devices. You can get the PowerPic Mod in White or Black today on Twelve South&#x27;s website for $59.99.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/20/macbook-pro-improved-thermal-system/">

                    <span>The new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros include entirely new designs and a new chassis, and one improvement of the newer chassis compared to its predecessor is improved thermals.





Apple says that the new thermal system in its latest high-end MacBooks is capable of moving 50% more air at lower fan speeds. While the new thermal design is greatly improved, the efficiency of the new M1 Pro and ‌M1‌ Max chips mean that for most customers, the &quot;fans never turn on&quot; for tasks done daily, according to Apple. 



Apple&#x27;s senior vice president of hardware engineering, John Ternus, touted during this week Apple&#x27;s event that the new chassis was designed with an &quot;intense focus on performance and utility.&quot; The new MacBook Pros are &quot;precisely machined around an advanced thermal system,&quot; he added. All in all, the new thermal architecture allows the new MacBook Pros to maintain high performance over more extended periods, without overheating or requiring the fans to turn on at higher speeds. 



The new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros, both configurable with the ‌M1‌ Pro or ‌M1‌ Max chips, are currently available for pre-order and will begin shipping to customers next week. Catch up on everything you need to know about these new MacBook Pros using our roundup.

                    <span>Following the highly accurate leaks about the new MacBook Pros that were first reported by MacRumors, we now have clearer details and more certain expectations about the next-generation MacBook Air that Apple is working on. Here&#x27;s everything we&#x27;ve learned in the past few months.





Here Comes the Notch (Again)


The next-generation ‌MacBook Air‌ will feature a notch in the display housing. This is according to Ty98, the same leaker who was first to mention the notch on the new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros. This detail was mentioned in the same highly accurate forum post from August 19 discussing the new MacBook Pro models.





The likelihood is that, similar to the MacBook Pro, there will be no Face ID in the next ‌MacBook Air‌, as the notch will house only the camera …</span>

                    <span>Apple&#x27;s third-generation AirPods feature a new skin-detect sensor for improved in-ear detection, according to Apple&#x27;s tech specs page and Taiwanese research firm TrendForce.





In a press release earlier this week, Apple confirmed that the third-generation AirPods feature a new skin-detect sensor that accurately discerns if the AirPods are in the ear — versus in a pocket or on a table — and pauses playback when removed. Industry insiders told TrendForce that the new skin-detect sensor may allow the third-generation AirPods to detect water content in the wearer&#x27;s skin for this purpose.



Meanwhile, Apple&#x27;s tech specs page indicates that the third-generation AirPods do not support Conversation Boost, a feature designed to help people with mild hearing challenges stay more connected in conversations. Conversation Boost is only available on the AirPods Pro following a firmware update earlier this month.



Conversation Boost uses the AirPods Pro&#x27;s beam-forming microphones to boost the volume of a person talking in front of you, making it easier to listen to a face-to-face conversation, and there is also an option to reduce ambient noise.



Apple unveiled the third-generation AirPods on Monday with a similar design as the AirPods Pro, but no active noise cancellation or silicone ear tips. Key features include improved sound quality with Adaptive EQ and spatial audio, longer battery life, a MagSafe charging case, IPX4-rated water and sweat resistance, and more. The third-generation AirPods are available to order now for $179 and will launch on Tuesday, October 26.

                    <span>Facebook is reportedly planning to change its name to better reflect Mark Zuckerberg&#x27;s goal of creating a &quot;metaverse,&quot; reports The Verge, claiming the change could come as soon as next week.





From the report:

The coming name change, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg plans to talk about at the company&#x27;s annual Connect conference on October 28th, but could unveil sooner, is meant to signal the tech giant&#x27;s ambition to be known for more than social media and all the ills that entail. The rebrand would likely position the blue Facebook app as one of many products under a parent company overseeing groups like Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus, and more. A spokesperson for Facebook declined to comment for this story.

                    <span>Just two days after Apple further advanced its Apple silicon portfolio with the M1 Pro and ‌M1‌ Max, marking the first professional high-end chips designed for the Mac, Intel is reportedly making yet another attempt to win Apple back as a customer.





A day before Apple&#x27;s long-awaited &quot;Unleashed&quot; event, Intel&#x27;s CEO, Pat Gelsinger, said despite Apple moving away from his company&#x27;s processors, he still hopes that Apple will return to Intel as a customer. Apple announced in June of 2020 its two-year-long transition to Apple silicon for the Mac, and despite Intel&#x27;s best hopes and dreams, Apple is continuing its momentum to break up with it.



Now, a new report from DigiTimes is further indicating Intel is still trying to win back Apple as a customer. According to the report, Intel…</span>

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(8 min)</span>
                    <span>The increasingly popular privacy-focused browser Brave is officially saying goodbye to Google as its default search engine, replacing the world&#x27;s most popular search engine in favor of &quot;Brave Search,&quot; the company announced in a blog post.





Brave Search is Brave&#x27;s answer to customers wanting a &quot;privacy-preserving&quot; search engine, and it&#x27;s built using Brave&#x27;s own &quot;independent index, and doesn&#x27;t track users, their searches, or their clicks.&quot; Brave users in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada will automatically have Brave Search set as their default search engine in the address bar instead of Google. Brave Search is also replacing other default browsers, such as Qwant in France and DuckDuckGo in Germany. 

 Today&#x27;s Brave desktop browser update (version 1.31), as well as the Brave Android app (version 1.31)* and the Brave iOS app (version 1.32) all automatically offer Brave Search as the default for new users in these five countries, with fully localized versions in non-English geographies. Brave users can easily choose a different search option if they prefer by managing their search engine settings. Brave Search is also available in any other browser at search.brave.com.
Users in all countries will still be able to revert their default search engine back to Google or DuckDuckGo, but Brave is hoping the majority won&#x27;t. Brave Search does not display any ads in its current form, but the company announced plans this week to change that. Brave says that the free version of its search engine will &quot;soon be ad-supported,&quot; with the company planning to offer a premium ad-free plan later down the line. Brave launched Brave Search in beta earlier this summer.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/19/apple-27-inch-xdr-display-early-2022-rumor/">

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Apple is planning to introduce a new 27-inch iMac in early 2022, according to Display Supply Chain Consultants CEO Ross Young. This information comes from both Young&#x27;s tweets and additional details that he shared with MacRumors.





Young told MacRumors that the 27-inch display for the iMac will feature mini-LED backlighting, which likely means that it will have XDR branding. Young tweeted that Apple is currently planning to release the new iMac in the first quarter of 2022.



Young added that the 27-inch iMac display will feature ProMotion, allowing for an adaptive refresh rate between 24Hz and 120Hz. At the time this story was published, Young did not say what the display&#x27;s resolution would be, but the current 27-inch iMac has 5K resolution.



Apple has introduced a few other products with mini-LED displays, including the 12.9-inch iPad Pro earlier this year and the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro this week. Young expects Apple&#x27;s recent leadership with mini-LEDs to continue with the new iMac.



While he made an initial misstep with this rumor in stating it was for a standalone display rather than an iMac, Young has proven to be very accurate with display-related rumors, having accurately forecasted that the new iPad mini would feature an 8.3-inch display and that the new MacBook Pro models would feature ProMotion. Young has 25 years of experience in the display industry and seems to be well connected with sources within the supply chain.



Update 9:45 p.m.: This article has been rewritten to reflect a correction issued by Young. While he initially stated the 27-inch mini-LED display was for an external monitor, he is now saying it is destined for an updated iMac. A monitor could come later.

                    <span>Possible huge scoop from Alex Heath for The Verge:
Facebook is planning to change its company name next week to
reflect its focus on building the metaverse, according to a source
with direct knowledge of the matter.
The coming name change, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg plans to talk
about at the company’s annual Connect conference on October 28th,
but could unveil sooner, is meant to signal the tech giant’s
ambition to be known for more than social media and all the ills
that entail. The rebrand would likely position the blue Facebook
app as one of many products under a parent company overseeing
groups like Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus, and more. A spokesperson
for Facebook declined to comment for this story.
It took Philip Morris an entire century to get to its Altria rebranding moment. If this pans out, it took Facebook 17 years.

                    <span>Loved this take on yesterday’s announcement from Jason Snell:
If Mac laptops come in eras, one just ended.
It started in 2016 with the release of MacBook Pro models
featuring butterfly keyboards, the Touch Bar, and a minimal
selection of USB-C ports. It ended on Monday with the announcement
of new MacBook Pro models that roll back most of the major changes
introduced in 2016, putting the MacBook Pro in a new state of
grace that recalls the middle of the last decade.
Also, this tidbit on maximum charging speeds:
(Here’s a quirk of the new MacBook Pros. On the 14-inch models,
the larger 96W USB-C power adapter is required for fast charging.
You can fast charge either via MagSafe or via a standard USB-C
cable attached to that adapter. However, on the 16-inch models — all of which come with a 140W adapter — you can only do
ultra-fast charging via MagSafe. While there’s a new specification
that allows for much higher power delivery levels over USB ports,
the Thunderbolt 4/USB 3 ports on the MacBook Pro don’t support it.
You can still charge via those ports, of course — just not at the
ultra-fastest speed.)

no, you didn’t miss an edition, I just failed to write again. The struggles of writing WDRL lately made me think and write down something but so far I have no conclusion on how it’ll go on. A few ideas are in my mind already. But autumn in full progress here in Germany, I found some time to read through articles and technologies and here is an edition mostly showing nice CSS solutions but also a couple of things to think about.

Philadelphia (good) are facing off against a Boston (bad) team that is well rested or rusty.
 The Philadelphia Flyers are riding high after their dominant performance — physically and on the score sheet —  over the floundering Seattle Kraken on Monday. Unfortunately, they might get knocked down, tumbling towards the ground as they are set to face the ever-formidable Boston Bruins on Wednesday and it is just the second game for them this season, so it can go one of two ways.



Perhaps the Bruins will (hopefully) come out slow-footed and really struggle to get warmed-up against a Flyers team that has really put forth a beginning to their 2021-22 campaign with a full effort. It isn’t the lazy Philadelphia team that appears too slow to compete with the …</span>

The energetic forward’s shoot-first mentally is already rubbing off on his new teammates in Philadelphia. 
 Philadelphia Flyers GM Chuck Fletcher wasn’t shy about making moves this past offseason to change up “the mix” of his team, and just two games in the returns on his big forward addition — Cam Atkinson — have been fruitful. 
Atkinson, acquired straight-up for Jakub Voracek in a trade with the Columbus Blue Jackets, has a goal and a primary assist in two games already, but his impact on the Flyers goes deeper than that. The former 40-goal scorer’s penchant for getting pucks to the net has already started to rub off on his teammates, with the Flyers registering 62 shots on goal through two games — with Atkinson’s nine ranking only behind capt…</span>

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *It is game day once again and tonight will mark the regular season debut of Martin Jones. Against the Bruins. The Real Test, as they say. Anyhoo, here’s what we learned from Monday’s barn-burner fun-time win. [BSH]
Now let’s talk about how this season already feels different after only two games. [The Athletic]
*Monday’s game against the Kraken was the first time in a long time that the Flyers delivered a proper blowout win. Felt good! [BSH]
*It’s also been a long time since we saw a game like the one we saw from Nate Thompson. [BSH]
*Somehow in the year of our lord 2021 people are still under the impression that Claude Giroux will leave Philadelphia to go play for THE OTTAWA SENATORS. [The Hockey News]
*Blissfully, this weeks 32 Thoughts puts the kibosh on that for the most part. [Sportsnet]
*Former Flyer Tom “silky mitts” Sestito is doing his part to raise awareness of the big-time painkiller problem currently plaguing the NHL. [Inquirer]
*And finally, the kind of power ranking you may not know you wanted but I promise you, you definitely do. You need it, actually. [The Athletic]</span>

Fans are upset over the news 
 The new dungeons coming as part of Destiny 2’s upcoming The Witch Queen expansion won’t be included in the Standard Edition or Season Pass. They will only be available as standalone purchases, or as part of the Deluxe Edition, a community manager from Bungie said via a Reddit post on Wednesday. 
Two of the dungeons will come as part of the Digital Deluxe Edition, which will be available for $79.99. There is also a third dungeon available as part of Bungie’s 30th Anniversary Bundle, which costs $24.99; players who want all three dungeons can buy both the Digital Deluxe Edition and the 30th Anniversary bundle for $99.99. (The Witch Queen alone, with its initial season attached to it, runs $39.99.)

The game will be available for $49.99 on Steam and the Epic Games Store. God of War’s Steam page is already active, for players that want to pre-order the game ahead of the January release. PC features listed on Steam include “high fidelity graphics,” including 4K resolution, DLSS and reflex support for higher frame rates and sharper graphics, and ultra-widescreen support.
God of War was originally released in 2018 to critical success; Polygon named it our Game of the Year for its “staggering technical achievement” and fantastic story. Sony is currently gearing up for a PlayStation 5 sequel for 2018’s God of War. God of War Ragnarok was originally slated for a 2021 release date, but was pushed to 2022 in June. An exact release date has not been announced. In September, Kratos’ voice actor, Christopher Judge, said Ragnarok was delayed due to his health.
God of War’s move away from PlayStation exclusivity continues a trend we’ve seen over the past few years. More and more companies are leaning away from platform exclusivity as the PC becomes home to, well, everything. 2017 hit Horizon Zero Dawn got a PC port last year, too, making God of War only the most recent PlayStation first-party title to make its way to the new platform.</span>

Halloween-themed ‘Emergence’ is first expedition with a narrative
 No Man’s Sky’s season-like Expeditions game mode gets a new adventure this month with Emergence, a Halloween-themed journey in which players must rid sand-covered planets of their Titan Worm infestations.
“As travelers cleanse planets of cursed dust and hunt the titanic sandworms, they will unravel the threads of a dark narrative,” Hello Games said in a statement announcing the new season. That means this expedition is the first one to carry a story.
Emergence comes with an overall title update to No Man’s Sky, which brings its own set of improvements and content enhancements. Players will see more varied Sandworms, and they can now tame and ride them — a timely update considering this week’s theater premiere of Dune.


Other gory, gross, or Halloween-themed features include the “Feasting Casque” echo appearance (it’s a “many-toothed, grotesque alien”) and the Ghastly Trail customization, which “applies a unique organic effect to the Jetpack’s exhaust nozzles, eject gooey fluids and tiny worms during flight.”
Mmm. Tasty.
The latest update will also apply richer particle effects to things like streaking meteors, muzzle flashes, explosions, and laser impacts.</span>

                    <span>When the TV watching experience moved from checking “your local listings” or TV Guide and surfing channels with your remote to scrolling through visual onscreen menus on streaming services, key art was born. Key art graphics are the images that identify shows in streaming menus — ok here, it’s just easier to show you:



Like the best movie posters and book covers, these images are bold and simple promotional signifiers of a larger piece of media, but as Rex Sorgatz argues in today’s edition of Why is this interesting?, key art is its own thing with its own set of constraints and challenges.
Good key art is so evocative, so iconic, that it becomes the image that springs to mind whenever you think about a show:
One neglected characteristic ties all these images together: They are all horizontal.
It sounds trivial, but going wide helped differentiate TV key art as its own medium, distinct from book covers and movie posters. And because these images appear on streaming platforms, they are unencumbered by other marketing copy, like taglines, cast and credits, and multifarious blurbs.
There is a simple purity to key art.


Sorgatz maintains an archive of his favorite key art here.

                    <span>For the last nine months, NASA’s Perseverance rover has been rolling around on Mars taking photos and doing science. It’s also been recording audio of its environment with a pair of microphones and in this video, a pair of NASA scientists share some of those recordings and what we might learn about Mars from them.
This is one of my absolute favorite sounds. This is the sound of a helicopter flying on Mars. We used this sound to actually understand the propagation of sound in general through the Martian atmosphere, and it turns out that we were totally wrong with our models. The Martian atmosphere can propagate sound a lot further than we thought it could.


And surprisingly for me, that’s my friend Nina in the video! (We eclipse-chased together in 2017.) I knew she was working on the rovers but didn’t know she was going to pop up in this video I found on Twitter this morning. Fun!

                    <span>For the last ten years, artist Amy Balkin has been collecting artifacts related to the climate crisis. The collection is called A People’s Archive of Sinking and Melting.
A People’s Archive of Sinking and Melting is a collection of materials contributed by people living in places that may disappear because of the combined physical, political, and economic impacts of climate change, primarily sea level rise, erosion, desertification, and glacial melting.


From a piece about the archive in the New Yorker:
There is an incredible pathos to Balkin’s collection of things. In the light of imagined future eyes, tinged by loss, all manner of things become relevant that would otherwise pass unnoticed. Even two beer-bottle caps, in this context, are mesmerizing. Both are from places that are threatened with a certain kind of disappearance, or, at the very least, radical change; through their corrosion and fading, they seemed to foretell this disappearance somehow. And yet, paradoxically, looking at them, I knew that these pieces of metal would likely outlast me. A future person might see them in a museum, displayed with a label that reads “Beer-bottle caps, common in this time.” But what would that person’s world be like? What would be lost, between now and then, even as these fragments are shored up against ruin?

                    <span>The new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros both feature a notch, a first for the Mac. Given we&#x27;ve never had a notch on a Mac, there are some questions over how macOS handles the notch, and more specifically, how the mouse pointer does. 





The predicament about how the mouse pointer handles the notch has been a question floated across Twitter and Reddit over the last 24 hours or so since the new MacBook Pro&#x27;s announcement. An animation posted on Reddit portrayed two main possibilities, one in which the mouse pointer travels behind the notch, being invisible to the user. The other option showcased the mouse pointer traveling around the notch. 



The new MacBook Pros will begin arriving next week, but thankfully, we don&#x27;t have to wait that long to get an answer. Linda Dong, an Apple designer, has confirmed on Twitter that the macOS pointer travels behind the notch, allowing users to essentially hide the mouse pointer from view. 



This behavior will come in handy, fundamentally making the notch a hiding place for the mouse pointer. This may come in good use, for example, when users want to more easily hide the mouse pointer while they watch a video. 



Apple is taking steps to make the notch less of an annoyance for most customers in day-to-day use. When macOS apps are in full-screen mode, Apple adds an artificial black bar to the top of the display that hides the notch. Developers can, however, opt to allow their apps to make full use of the entire screen real estate, notch included.

                    <span>Alongside the 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro models, Apple introduced a $19 &quot;Polishing Cloth&quot; that&#x27;s designed to be used with Apple devices.





Made from a &quot;soft, nonabrasive material,&quot; the cloth is suitable for Apple displays, including the nano-texture glass of the Pro Display XDR. It&#x27;s also suitable for use with the mini-LED display of the new MacBook Pro models and all manner of iPhones, iPads, and Macs.



Those who were hoping to get a Polishing Cloth with their MacBook Pros and who have not already ordered may be out of luck, as initial supplies have sold out. If ordered today, the Polishing Cloth will not arrive until November 18 to November 24, which is quite a long wait for a piece of cloth.





Apple&#x27;s support document on cleaning Apple products recommends a soft, lint-free cloth and minimal wiping. Cleaners should not be used, but if a deep cleaning is required, a 70 percent isopropyl alcohol solution can be used to moisten the cloth.



Apple has been shipping a similar Polishing Cloth with the nano-texture Pro Display XDR since its launch. Based on the instructions provided with that cloth, the new cloth can be hand washed with dish soap and water should it become dirty.



As of now, the Polishing Cloth is not available in Apple&#x27;s retail stores, though retail locations could potentially begin offering stock next week when the MacBook Pro models launch.

                    <span>A day after Apple unveiled redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models, we continue to learn smaller details about the notebooks that Apple did not mention during its event, and the latest discovery pertains to fast charging.





Apple&#x27;s website indicates that its 67W USB-C power adapter included with the base model 14-inch MacBook Pro is not capable of fast charging any 14-inch MacBook Pro. To take advantage of fast charging, which allows for a 50% charge in around 30 minutes, Apple says customers can upgrade to its 96W USB-C power adapter for an additional $20.



Apple includes the 96W adapter with any 14-inch MacBook Pro model with an M1 Pro chip with a 10‑core CPU or any M1 Max chip, so customers choosing those higher-end configurations don&#x27;t have to worry about any f…</span>

                    <span>This week, Apple announced a major update for its high-end MacBook Pros, with the new machines featuring a complete redesign, larger mini-LED displays with ProMotion, an HDMI port and SD card slot, full-sized function keys, and more. The new machines contain one of two scaled-up variants of the M1 System on Chip (SoC), the ‌M1‌ Pro or the ‌M1‌ Max.

                    <span>Apple yesterday provided the release candidate version of macOS Monterey to developers, and the RC represents the final version of Monterey that will be going out to the public on Monday.





In the update, Apple introduced a new &quot;Monterey&quot; screen saver, which is designed to accompany the Monterey wallpaper that was already available.



The Monterey screen saver offers slow transitions through hills and valleys in different shades of pink, purple, and blue, as demonstrated in the video below.

Apple made some major changes in the final beta of ‌macOS Monterey‌, undoing nearly all of the Safari design changes that had been introduced in June. Safari looks like it did in macOS Big Sur, but there is an option for the new &quot;Compact&quot; Monterey design for those who prefer it.



‌macOS Monterey‌ is set to be released on Monday, October 25, one day ahead of when the new MacBook Pro models are launching.

                    <span>Google today announced its latest flagship smartphones, the Pixel 6 and the Pixel 6 Pro. The two new devices are already garnering positive reviews for their high-end feature set available at an affordable price tag.





Priced at $599 and $899, respectively, the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are Google&#x27;s first smartphones that are equipped with the Google Tensor system-on-a-chip, which Google designed. Apple has long used mobile chips that it designs in house, and Google&#x27;s choice to design its own Tensor chips will allow for better integration of hardware and software.



The Pixel 6 features a 6.4-inch OLED display with a 90Hz refresh rate, while the Pixel 6 Pro features a larger, curved-edge 6.7-inch OLED display and a 120Hz refresh rate.

                    <span>Instagram still doesn&#x27;t offer an app for the iPad, but the social networking company has expanded how users can upload content to the site, allowing for pictures to be posted from the desktop.





According to TechCrunch, Instagram is rolling out desktop posting support this week after testing the feature with a limited number of users over the summer.



Sharing a photo or a video under one minute on Instagram from the desktop can be done by navigating to the Instagram website and signing into an account. From there, click on the &quot;+&quot; button in the top right corner of the webpage and select photos from your computer. Filters, captions, and location tags can be added.



The desktop posting feature is still rolling out, so not all users will see it right away.

                    <span>Apple&#x27;s new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models are equipped with improved &quot;XDR&quot; displays with mini-LED backlighting. Impressively, both new MacBook Pro models have up to 3x brighter displays compared to the previous-generation models, although the increased brightness is likely limited to HDR content.





The new MacBook Pro models achieve up to 1,000 nits sustained full-screen brightness and up to 1,600 nits peak brightness, according to Apple&#x27;s tech specs, whereas the previous models were listed as having up to 500 nits of brightness. In line with Apple&#x27;s Pro Display XDR, though, it&#x27;s likely that the increased brightness is limited to HDR content, as the Pro Display XDR is limited to up to 500 nits of brightness for SDR content.

                    <span>Apple has confirmed to The Verge that its new 140W USB-C power adapter is the company&#x27;s first charger based on gallium nitride or &quot;GaN&quot; technology, which allows for smaller, lighter, and more power efficient chargers than silicon-based chargers.





Without the use of GaN, the 140W power adapter likely would have been fairly larger given its wattage. Many other brands like Anker and Belkin have introduced GaN-based chargers over the last few years for use with Apple products.  



Apple also confirmed that the 140W power adapter supports the USB-C Power Delivery 3.1 standard, meaning that it can be used to charge other devices that support that standard. It also means that those who buy the new 16-inch MacBook Pro can use compatible chargers from third-party brands to charge the notebook if they prefer.



We continue to learn smaller details about the new MacBook Pro models that Apple didn&#x27;t mention during its &quot;Unleashed&quot; event, including that fast charging is only possible with the MagSafe port on the new 16-inch MacBook Pro, whereas the 14-inch model can be fast charged using either MagSafe or any of the Thunderbolt 4 ports. This shouldn&#x27;t be a big deal given that the MagSafe port has no other use than charging, but it&#x27;s worth knowing.



Key features of the new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro include Apple&#x27;s next-generation M1 Pro and M1 Max chips, the return of an HDMI port and SD card slot, mini-LED displays with a ProMotion adaptive refresh rate up to 120Hz, up to 10 hours longer battery life, and more. The notebooks can be ordered now and launch on Tuesday, October 26.



Apple&#x27;s new 140W power adapter is included with the new 16-inch MacBook Pro and it is also sold separately for $99.

                    <span>Apple is making impressive and eye-catching claims about the performance of its new M1 Pro and ‌M1‌ Max chips, and on paper, the highest-end ‌M1‌ Max chip actually has more raw GPU performance than Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 5.





The ‌M1‌ Max chip can be configured to include up to a 32-core GPU, a gigantic leap compared to the 8-core GPU option offered in the ‌M1‌ chip. Apple says that the ‌M1‌ Max chip uses 70% less power at peak graphic performance than a PC laptop with a discrete graphics card. Apple also claims that the ‌M1‌ Max chip offers &quot;similar performance&quot; to a &quot;pro laptop with high-performing discrete GPU&quot; while using 100 watts less power. 





To make the claims, Apple tested the 16-inch MacBook Pro with the ‌M1‌ Max chip, featuring a 10-core CPU, 32-core GPU, and 64GB…</span>

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>With the debut of the new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models, Apple has brought a fast charge capability to the Mac for the first time, allowing users to charge the laptop battery up to 50% in just 30 minutes. 





But there&#x27;s a difference between models with this feature that Apple didn&#x27;t really mention. While both models can be charged over Thunderbolt or MagSafe, only the 14-inch MacBook Pro can fast charge over the USB-C/Thunderbolt 4 ports as well as ‌MagSafe‌. 



By contrast, the 16-inch MacBook Pro is limited to fast charging over the ‌MagSafe‌ port. The reason is likely down to the fact that the Thunderbolt 4 ports are capable of charging at a maximum of 100W, and the 16-inch MacBook Pro uses a 140W power adapter, so the same fast charging speed can&#x27;t be claimed. Meanwhile, the 14-inch model uses a 67W power adapter for the 8-core machine and a 96W power adapter for the 10-core machine, so it doesn&#x27;t reach the maximum TB4 power delivery. 



This limitation on the 16-inch MacBook Pro is unlikely to be a big deal for most users, as the ‌MagSafe‌ 3 port is made exclusively for charging and won&#x27;t be engaged for any other reason. That said, this difference between the two seems worth highlighting given the various cable/dock setups prospective owners could be envisioning for their workflow.



The new MacBook Pro models can be ordered now, with pricing starting at $1,999 for the 14-inch model and at $2,499 for the 16-inch model. The notebooks will begin arriving to customers and launch in stores on Tuesday, October 26.

                    <span>Following a promise of &quot;later this year&quot; in June, Apple has officially rolled out its new and updated Apple Maps in Australia. 





The new ‌Apple Maps‌ offers richer details in roads, parking lots, parks, buildings, airports, and more, and is part of Apple&#x27;s push to rival Google Maps and other third-party map services. In Australia, customers will now have access to new ‌Apple Maps‌. Apple last month rolled out the revamped ‌Apple Maps‌ to Italy, and Spain, and Portugal earlier in the summer.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Apple on Monday announced third-generation AirPods, featuring an updated design, improved sound quality, and an extra hour of battery life compared to the second-generation ‌AirPods‌, which offer five hours of listening time. However, what Apple didn&#x27;t make very explicit in its marketing is that to get six hours out of its latest earphones, spatial audio must be disabled.





As noted in Apple&#x27;s fine print, if spatial audio is enabled, users can expect up to five hours of battery. That&#x27;s the same amount of listening time offered by the second-generation ‌AirPods‌, which don&#x27;t support spatial audio, but still half an hour longer than the AirPods Pro. That said, ‌AirPods Pro‌ can also be pushed to five hours of listening time by turning off Active Noise Cancelation and Transparency mode.



The new ‌‌AirPods‌‌, as rumored, feature a design similar to the ‌AirPods Pro‌ but without silicone eartips or Active Noise Cancelation. The new ‌‌AirPods‌‌ also include Adaptive EQ, which adjusts frequencies in real-time based on what a user is listening to deliver even improved sound quality. 



According to Apple&#x27;s specifications page for the new ‌AirPods‌, the third-generation ‌AirPods‌ do not support the iPhone 6, ‌iPhone‌ 6 Plus, and the ‌iPhone‌ 5s, because they require iOS 13 to work. They also drop support for the iPad mini 2 and ‌iPad mini‌ 3 alongside the sixth-generation iPod touch. 



The new third-generation ‌AirPods‌ are being offered alongside the second-generation ‌AirPods‌, as well as the higher-end ‌AirPods Pro‌. The new ‌AirPods‌ are available for pre-order now and will begin shipping next week.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/19/16-inch-macbook-pro-m1-pro-m1-max-weight/">

                    <span>The new 16-inch MacBook Pro can be configured with either the M1 Pro or ‌M1‌ Max chips. The ‌M1‌ Max chip is the highest-end Apple silicon chip available, and alongside the added performance, the 16-inch MacBook Pro with the ‌M1‌ Max chip comes with another difference — it&#x27;s heavier, slightly.





As we&#x27;ve already highlighted, the new 16-inch MacBook Pro is heavier and thicker than the previous model. The added thickness and weight come from a new chassis, more ports, and other factors. Apple&#x27;s specification breakdown page for the new 16-inch MacBook Pro says that models configured with the ‌M1‌ Pro chip will weigh 4.7 pounds, or 2.1 kg, while models shipping with the ‌M1‌ Max chip will weigh 4.8 pounds or 2.2 kg. 



The ‌M1‌ Max chip is physically bigger than the ‌M1‌ Pro chip; however, the 14-inch MacBook Pro, which is also offered with the ‌M1‌ Max chip, features the same weight regardless of the chip used. A footnote on Apple&#x27;s page says that the weight difference on the larger 16-inch model between ‌M1‌ Pro and ‌M1‌ Max results from the &quot;configuration and manufacturing process.&quot;

                    <span>Apple is offering customers up to $1,000 of trade-in value for the M1 MacBook Pro and ‌M1‌ MacBook Air, giving customers who purchased the first round of Apple silicon Macs an incentive to upgrade to the new, more powerful MacBook Pros.





The new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros are no jokes when it comes to price. The 14-inch MacBook Pro starts at $1,999, with the highest-end 16-inch MacBook Pro racking up a $6,099 price tag. The new laptops, powered by either the ‌M1‌ Pro or ‌M1‌ Max chips, also introduce a completely new design, featuring smaller bezels, an all-black keyboard, redesigned internals, and more.



As is always the case with Apple device trade-ins, the exact value will differ depending on the device&#x27;s condition, when it was introduced, and its specific specifications. For customers with the MacBook Pro with the ‌M1‌ chip and 8-cores of CPU and GPU, 8GB of RAM, and 2TB of storage, Apple is offering up to $1,000 for trade-in. It seems as though that the amount of RAM the MacBook has does not impact the trade-in value a customer is ultimately quoted.  



Customers can use Apple&#x27;s interactive trade-in panel during checkout for a new MacBook Pro to get the exact trade-in value their device has. To catch up on everything Apple announced during its &quot;Unleashed&quot; event, be sure to check out our comprehensive coverage.

                    <span>With the macOS Monterey and iPadOS 15 release candidates that were seeded to developers today, Apple has eliminated the option to use the Color Tab Bar with the separate tab design in Safari.




A tab bar with color in Safari 15


If you want to have a color tab bar that blends in with the background color of a website, you need to toggle on the Compact Tab Bar, which is the tab bar design that Apple introduced with macOS Monterey and iPadOS 15 updates. &quot;Show Color in Compact Tab Bar&quot; is an option that can be enabled in both iPadOS 15.1 and ‌macOS Monterey‌.



On the iPad, the option is available in the Safari section of the Settings app. Scroll down to the bottom to find it and toggle it on, and then the color tab interface will show up when the ‌iPad‌ is using the Compact Tab Bar.



On the Mac, the Show Color in Compact Tab Bar option can be toggled on in the Safari preferences under Advanced and then Accessibility.



Apple today updated macOS Monterey to change the tabs back to the original tab design, essentially undoing many of the design changes that were introduced in Safari with the initial release of the Monterey beta. As of now, the standard Big Sur design is the default, and the Compact Tab Bar is an optional change that can be toggled on.



It is not surprising that Apple has made this change as the color tab bar interface was designed for the new look in Monterey and not the older Big Sur design that Apple has now reverted to.

                    <span>“Lawmakers Give Amazon ‘Final Chance’ to Clear Up Testimony”, from the AP:
The letter says the antitrust subcommittee is considering
referring the case to the Justice Department for criminal
investigation. It accuses the world’s biggest online retailer of
at least misleading Congress and possibly outright lying.
It cites recent media reports detailing Amazon’s alleged practice
of undercutting the businesses that sell on its platform by making
“knock-offs,” or very similar products, and boosting their
presence on the site.
The reports directly contradict the sworn testimony of Amazon
executives and other statements to Congress, the letter says. It
was signed by Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y.,
and the Democratic and Republican leaders of the antitrust panel.

                    <span>This plan struck me as weird when it was announced during the keynote, but it makes sense for the way many people use Apple Music: by just asking Siri to play whatever, where “whatever” is a particular song, a particular artist, or a particular mood. If this is your plan, when you go to the Music app on your devices, the interface will just be Siri suggestions and your listening history.
What more do you get for the regular price of $10/month? Spatial audio (potentially cool, depending upon how carefully the songs were mastered), lossless audio (borderline pointless), offline mode (downloading songs to your device), custom playlists, lyrics, and music videos. For me, it’d be really weird not to be able to browse an available index of all music (artist → album → song), but a lot of people just ask Siri for whatever.
Spotify doesn’t offer a plan like this (screenshot for posterity) — but Spotify doesn’t have its own voice-driven hardware. Amazon Music has a $4/month Echo plan that is very similar, but Amazon’s Echo plan is limited to one single Echo device or Fire TV.

                    <span>John Pinette, VP of communications for Facebook, in a series of tweets:
Right now 30+ journalists are finishing up a coordinated series
of articles based on thousands of pages of leaked documents. We
hear that to get the docs, outlets had to agree to the conditions
and a schedule laid down by the PR team that worked on earlier
leaked docs.
A curated selection out of millions of documents at Facebook can
in no way be used to draw fair conclusions about us. Internally,
we share work in progress and debate options. Not every suggestion
stands up to the scrutiny we must apply to decisions affecting so
many people.
To those news organizations who would like to move beyond an
orchestrated “gotcha” campaign, we are ready to engage on the
substance.
Casey Johnston:
this tweet appears to contain words but all i hear are little baby
crying sounds? can you explain
There was a time when “VP of communications for Facebook” sounded like a great job, I bet. That time is not now.

Beyond the goals, the theatrics of the sport were put on full display against Seattle.
 If you asked me just 24 hours ago to pick out Nick Seeler from a lineup of dozens and dozens of hockey players, I would simply just give up and throw my hands in the air as an act of succumbing to the gap-toothed smiles in front of me.
But after last night’s game against the Seattle Kraken, the Philadelphia Flyers depth defenseman has shuffled his way to the very front of my mind and I will never forget the cinematic gladiator-esque look on his face after absolutely destroying the confidence of towering blueliner Jamie Oleksiak.

Nate Thompson accomplished something on Monday night not done by a Flyers player since Zac Rinaldo.
 25: The number of penalty minutes assessed to Nate Thompson on Monday night.
Nate Thompson and Zac Rinaldo have more in common than you think. The Flyers&#x27; fourth liners are the last two Flyers players to record 25 penalty minutes (or more) in a game.
An honorable mention goes to Jakub Voracek, who had 22 PIM on October 15th, 2016. And of course, Wayne Simmonds, who had a handful of games with penalty minutes in the teens.
Thompson picked up a career-high 25 penalty minutes in Monday night’s 6-1 win against the Seattle Kraken. The fourth-line center was assessed a 10-minute misconduct at the 12:00 mark of the second period. This coincided with a 10-mi…</span>

Well, “easy” is relative, but that was a blowout the likes of which we didn’t see much of last season.
 You know what’s fun? When your favorite hockey team (in this case, your, my, and our Philadelphia Flyers) is winning games.
You know what’s also fun? When your favorite team wins an exciting, intense game.
But you know what’s maybe even more fun? When your favorite team just beats the everliving snot out of whoever it’s facing and coasts to an easy, non-dramatic win.
And you know who hasn’t had a ton of fun over the past year or so of watching their favorite team play hockey? Us, as Flyers fans, perhaps because we have not had many games where the Flyers just beat the everliving snot out of whoever they were facing. Y’know ... like they did in…</span>

A bit of revenge?
 Well, that’s more like it, huh? After dropping their season opener in the shootout to the Canucks on Friday, the Flyers had a big game on deck last night, as their old head coach Dave Hakstol and the Kraken came to town. If there was some worry that this one was going to be ugly because, well, the fates, it was quickly assuaged when the Flyers took the momentum from a big save by Carter Hart on Jordan Eberle and ran with it. They kept their foot on the gas for the the rest of the game, and cruised to a 6-1 win over their brand new rival. A tidy bit of business, not too bad at all.

As resounding a win as you’re going to find, folks.
 After a frustrating season opening loss, the Flyers more than made up for it with a dominating performance vs. the league’s newest team in the Seattle Kraken.
First Period
Well, this game certainly didn’t start the way the Flyers would have liked. To their credit, the Kraken came out absolutely firing on Carter Hart and the orange and black. Their forecheck was tenacious and gave most of the Flyers’ blueliners fits, and the forwards really weren’t able to do much with some stifling backcheck facing them. 
As the period progressed however, the Flyers slowly began to find their footing and in large part due to the sensational work of Hart. After his shaky opening start, there were some reasons for c…</span>

                    <span>Explore 9th century Scandinavia in a free expansion, or stand-alone module for PC
 Assassin’s Creed Discovery Tour: Viking Age, the free-roam education and exploration mode for Assassin’s Creed Valhalla that Ubisoft announced during E3 2021, is available today.
Like Discovery Tours for 2017’s Assassin’s Creed Origins and 2018’s Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, Viking Age is both a free expansion for those who already own Valhalla, and is a stand-alone purchase for Windows PC. It’s available from Ubisoft Connect and the Epic Games Store.
Assassin’s Creed Discovery Tour: Viking Age will also launch in early 2022 for Google Stadia and Amazon Luna, Ubisoft said.
The mode removes all of the combat and any objectionable content (nudity, mostly) from the base game, allowing it to be used as an educational tool in classrooms studying this period of world history. This Discovery Tour, however, will place players in the roles of different characters, and give them quests to complete, connecting them more with the educational message inside. 
Ubisoft said this Tour, like the others, was also developed with input from historians and archaeologists. Viking Age will feature Discovery Sites players can explore to learn more about the culture and traditions of Vikings and Anglo-Saxons in ninth-century England and Norway. The Discovery Sites were developed in partnership with six museums in three nations — England, France, and Denmark.</span>

An autobiographical game told in poems
 It’s nice to feel understood. For someone to tell you they see you, they hear you. This is a key idea in Cibele designer Nina Freeman’s latest game, Last Call. With collaborator Jake Jefferies, Freeman’s Last Call is once again an autobiographical game, “based on the lived experience of the game designer,” Freeman said in the game’s description on itch.io.
Last Call is centered on domestic violence and recovery, described through a series of poems tucked away in flickering, fiery boxes. From beginning to end, Last Call takes place in a partially-packed up apartment, in anticipation of a move. The apartment is free of others, lit only by dim windows and the boxes on fire. The boxes contain a person’s belongi…</span>

                    <span>Hand over that synthesizer! 
 In a world where music is illegal, musicians and fans flock to dark web forums — the Musicnet — to share tunes and talk shop. Echo Beach, created by Rivals developer Tim Sheinman, is set in a future where music’s been banned and teams of government workers infiltrate internet forums to seek out musicians and music bloggers.
In Echo Beach, I play as a clerk at the government-run Ministry, tasked with eliminating musicians harbored in The Musicnet. Like Rivals before it, Echo Beach has a full, original soundtrack (with 11 songs) that’s one of the game’s major draws. Simply put, the music is just good, pulling together a bunch of different genres and singers. 
Echo Beach is set primarily on a single screen, in a cubicle with a computer, sticky notes, and a musici…</span>

Is Ubisoft finally listening to Tom Clancy fans?
 A mainline console and PC title for Ubisoft’s Splinter Cell series is in development, reports Video Games Chronicle. The news comes right as a demoralized community of Tom Clancy fans practically downvoted Ubisoft’s free-to-play Ghost Recon into a delay.
Video Games Chronicle sourced its report to two unnamed persons with knowledge of Ubisoft’s plans. Lead development on the Splinter Cell game is being handled by a studio other than Ubisoft Montreal, which developed the first of seven games in the nearly 20-year-old series, and three of the others. Ubisoft Toronto handled the most recent, 2013’s Tom Clancy’s Splinter Ce…</span>

                    <span>Others (like Timothy Snyder) have been saying this for months and years, but in a succinct 8-minute monologue, Bill Maher1 lays out what’s going to happen over the next three years that will pave the way for Donald Trump and the Republicans to take back the White House and set up the biggest political crisis in the United States since the Civil War.
A document came to light a few weeks ago called the Eastman Memo, which was basically a blueprint prepared for Trump on how he could steal the election after he lost it in November 2020. It outlined a plan for overturning the election by claiming that seven states actually had competing state slates of electors, which while not even remotely true, would have given Mike Pence the excuse to throw out those states and thus hand the election to Trump.
But of course the plan required election officials in those states to go along. Trump thought the ones who were Republican would. Most did not. And that’s what he’s been working on fixing ever since.



You might have strong feelings about Bill Maher. Ok, fine. But he’s right about this.↩

                    <span>Apple today held its second fall event, which focused on the MacBook Pro and the AirPods. Apple introduced new 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with a total design overhaul featuring MagSafe, no Touch Bar, HDMI port and SD card slot, and a mini-LED display that features a notch. Apple also debuted new super powerful M1 Pro and ‌M1‌ Max chips, which join the existing ‌M1‌ chip.

                    <span>Apple&#x27;s new MacBook Pro machines are equipped with super efficient M1 Pro and ‌M1‌ Max chips, which means improvements in both performance and efficiency. The new machines have much improved battery life compared to prior-generation Intel machines. 





The 14-inch MacBook Pro with ‌M1‌ Pro/Max chip offers up to 17 hours of movie playback with the Apple TV app and up to 11 hours of wireless web browsing. The prior 2020 Intel model offered 10 hours of movie playback and 10 hours of wireless web browsing. 



‌M1‌ Pro/Max performance is on par with ‌M1‌ performance, but it can&#x27;t quite match wireless web battery life. The ‌M1‌ chip in the entry-level MacBook Pro and the MacBook Air offers 20 hours of movie playback and up to 17 hours of wireless web browsing.

                    <span>Apple in 2016 removed all of the ports from its MacBook Pro models except for Thunderbolt ports, a design that persisted for years -- until today. The newly announced 2021 MacBook Pro models include an SD card slot and an HDMI port alongside three Thunderbolt ports. 





As noted in Apple&#x27;s technical specifications for the new machine, the HDMI port is unfortunately not top of the line -- it is an HDMI 2.0 port instead of an HDMI 2.1 port. 



The HDMI 2.0 port supports a single 4K display with a resolution of up to 60Hz. HDMI 2.1 technology would have allowed the port to run a 4K display with a 120Hz refresh rate. 



It&#x27;s curious that Apple did not include HDMI 2.1 in the MacBook Pro models because the Apple TV 4K that was released earlier this year does have an HDMI 2.1 port. 




HDMI port is only HDMI 2.0, exactly why I’d much rather have had another T4 port, what a waste. pic.twitter.com/zzUXwfGoO8

With the Thunderbolt 4 ports, the M1 Pro MacBook Pro models overall support up to two external displays with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz. The ‌M1‌ Max MacBook Pro models support up to three external displays with up to 6K resolution and one external display with up to 4K resolution at 60Hz.

                    <span>Back in late September, mentions of a &quot;High Power&quot; mode were spotted in macOS Monterey code, and it appears Apple is still working on the feature. Battery code in the macOS Monterey release candidate mentions a &quot;High Power&quot; option, and this time, includes additional detail.





&quot;Your Mac will optimize performance to better support resource-intensive tasks. This may result in louder fan noise,&quot; reads the code. The mention was discovered by MacRumors contributor Steve Moser.



There is no High Power mode that appears to be present in the ‌macOS Monterey‌ beta on an M1 Mac, so it&#x27;s possible that this is something that&#x27;s exclusive to the ‌M1‌ Pro and ‌M1‌ Max MacBook Pro machines that are launching next week. Such a feature was not mentioned on stage today.





It&#x27;s also possible that this is a forthcoming feature that&#x27;s not quite ready to launch and that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re not yet seeing it as a consumer-facing option in ‌macOS Monterey‌.



‌macOS Monterey‌ is set to be released to the public on Monday, October 25, and the ‌M1‌ Pro and ‌M1‌ Max MacBook Pro models will begin arriving to customers the next day, so we won&#x27;t have long to wait to find out if there&#x27;s a hidden High Power mode.

                    <span>The new third-generation AirPods drop support for older iPhones, iPads, and iPod touch models previously supported by the second-generation AirPods.





According to Apple&#x27;s specifications page for the new AirPods, the third-generation AirPods do not support the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, and the iPhone 5s. They also drop support for the iPad mini 2 and iPad mini 3 alongside the sixth-generation iPod touch. Apple’s footnotes for the new AirPods‌ explain why, stating that some of the features require iOS 13, which none of the above-listed devices support. 

Some features require iOS 13 or iPadOS, which are not compatible with iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6, iPhone 5s, iPod touch (6th generation), iPad Air (1st generation), iPad mini 3, and iPad mini 2. Audio Sharing not supported.
The new third-generation AirPods are being offered alongside the second-generation AirPods, as well as the higher-end AirPods Pro. The new AirPods are available for pre-order today and will begin shipping next week.

                    <span>Apple today unveiled third-generation AirPods with a similar design as the AirPods Pro and several new features, but those likely aren&#x27;t the only new headphones launching soon, as MacRumors contributor Steve Moser has found images of unreleased Beats Fit Pro earbuds in the iOS 15.1 Release Candidate seeded earlier today.





The images reveal that the Beats Fit Pro will look similar to the Beats Studio Buds that were unveiled back in June, with the new headphones appearing to feature a completely wireless in-ear design with tiny earhooks.



The images also show that the Beats Fit Pro will be available in at least four colors, including a white, black, gray, and pink, and iOS 15.1 beta code indicates the headphones will have both Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode.





According to 9to5Mac&#x27;s Filipe Espósito, the Beats Fit Pro will be announced around November 1 and shipments will begin within a few days after that.

                    <span>The new MacBook Pros, for the first time in a Mac, feature a notch. While some have been quick to criticize Apple&#x27;s design choice, it turns out that the notch may not be entirely visible in day-to-day use when using apps in full screen, as when macOS apps are in full-screen mode, it essentially disappears.





According to Apple&#x27;s marketing material, when macOS apps are in full-screen mode, macOS places an artificial black bezel at the top of the display that essentially hides the notch. When users are not in full-screen macOS apps, the notch remains, and the macOS Menu Bar has been made thicker to accommodate the notch.





The inclusion of a notch allowed Apple to make the bezels on the new 14-and 16-inch MacBook Pros considerably thinner compared to the previous 13-inch and 16-inch models. The new displays, for the first time in a MacBook, are Liquid Retina XDR displays and include ProMotion technology. The new MacBook Pros are available to order starting today and will begin shipping next week.

                    <span>Apple today updated the AirPods lineup with the AirPods 3, which feature an AirPods Pro-like design featuring shorter stems, spatial audio support, Adaptive EQ, longer battery life, HD voice quality for FaceTime, IPX4 water resistance, a MagSafe case, and more.





The new AirPods are priced starting at $179, which is $20 cheaper than the prior AirPods 2 with Wireless Charging Case, and Apple is also keeping the AirPods 2 around as a lower-cost option. Apple&#x27;s full AirPods lineup now looks like this:



 	
AirPods 2 - $129


 	
AirPods 3 - $179


 	
AirPods Pro - $249


 	
AirPods Max - $549




It&#x27;s worth noting that Apple has also introduced a new version of the AirPods Pro that come with a MagSafe Charging Case like the AirPods 3. The MagSafe Charging Case is able to quickly align with MagSafe charging pad options.



New AirPods Pro purchases will come with the MagSafe Charging Case, but for those wondering if you can get the case on a standalone basis, you can&#x27;t. Apple does not plan to offer the MagSafe Charging Case on its own, so there will be no upgrade option. The standard AirPods Pro wireless charging case can be used with MagSafe anyway because it&#x27;s a Qi-based wireless charging protocol. All that&#x27;s missing is the magnetic alignment.



The AirPods 3 can be pre-ordered from Apple&#x27;s website starting today, and are set to arrive to customers next week.

Based on these numbers, the ‌M1‌ Max outperforms all Mac chips with the exception of the Mac Pro and iMac models equipped with Intel&#x27;s high-end 16 to 24-core Xeon chips. The 11542 multi-core score is on par with the late 2019 ‌Mac Pro‌ that is equipped with a 12-core Intel Xeon W-3235.



The machine with the chip in question is running macOS 12.4, which we have seen in our analytics, and Geekbench&#x27;s John Poole believes the result is legitimate. He initially said there was an issue with the frequency estimation, but he believes that this is an issue with Geekbench and not the processor. 



We should be seeing additional ‌M1‌ Max and ‌M1‌ Pro Geekbench results in the coming days as the new MacBook Pro models are expected to arrive to customers next Tuesday and media review units will be going out even sooner than that.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Apple today announced completely redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models that in the case of the 16-inch model is unsurprisingly thicker and heavier than the previous generation.





Apple announced a new 14-inch model that replaced the high-end Intel 13-inch MacBook Pros. Given the larger screen, it&#x27;s not fair to compare the two models. What is fair game, however, is to take a look at the new 16-inch MacBook Pro compared to the previous generation. We&#x27;ve put side by side the weight, height, and depth differences for the new 16-inch MacBook Pro compared to the previous generation.



2021 16-inch MacBook Pro



Weight: 4.7 pounds (2.1 kg)


Height: 0.66 inches (1.68 cm)


Depth: 9.77 inches (24.81 cm)


Width: 14.01 inches (35.37 cm)








2019 16-inch MacBook Pro



Weight: 4.3 pounds (2.0 kg)


Height: 0.64 inches (1.62 cm)


Depth: 9.68 inches (24.59 cm)


Width: 14.09 inches (35.79 cm)







As you can see from above, the new 16-inch MacBook Pro is nearly 9% heavier than the previous generation and is also slightly thicker. The new MacBook Pros feature a redesigned designed body, that is not also thicker and heavier, but also includes more I/O ports and new features. Learn more about these new MacBook Pros here.

                    <span>Delivery dates for various MacBook Pro configurations have started to slip, with some of the 16-inch MacBook Pro models now listing delivery dates ranging from November 2 to November 16, up from the original October 26 delivery date. 





For stock machines, the entry-level $2,499 16-inch MacBook Pro with M1 Pro chip and high-end 16-inch MacBook Pro with ‌M1‌ Max chip now list November 2 to November 9 delivery dates, with the middle tier option delivering from October 26 to November 2. 



As for the 14-inch machines, October 26 delivery continues to be an option for now, but the higher-end model with 10-core CPU and 16-core GPU might not deliver until November 2. 



Custom configurations have longer lead times and some higher-end machines that have been customized will not be shipping out until November or even December in the case of a maxed out 16-inch MacBook Pro. 



If you want a 14-inch MacBook Pro on launch day, it&#x27;s best to order now as the delivery estimates will continue to slip for all machines. Apple should have MacBook Pro models available for in-store purchase on Tuesday, but that will be limited to stock configurations.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Apple has admitted defeat on the Safari design changes that have been present for the entire macOS Monterey beta, and the release candidate that was provided to developers today reverts to the old style that was available prior to Safari 15. 




Safari design in the ‌macOS Monterey‌ release candidate


‌macOS Monterey‌ now features a standard Big Sur tab design that does have the tabs with spaces in between them, which Mac users who were unhappy with the design update will be pleased to hear. 




Safari design in the prior ‌macOS Monterey‌ beta


The standard tab design is enabled by default and is labeled &quot;Separate&quot; in the Safari preferences, but for those who preferred the original Monterey Safari design, there&#x27;s also a &quot;Compact&quot; option that merges the URL bar with the tab bar. 



Apple in the prior Monterey beta moved the Favorites bar back up above the tab bar, so now Safari looks about the same as it did prior to when Apple made the Monterey changes. There are, however, still new Safari features like Tab Groups. 



‌macOS Monterey‌ with no changes to the Safari design will be coming on Monday, October 25.

                    <span>Apple has nixed all of the Intel MacBook Pro models from its MacBook Pro lineup, with the prior-generation Intel i7 and i9 machines now discontinued.





All of Apple&#x27;s MacBook Pro models now feature M-series chips as the company continues to phase out Intel chips. That means Apple&#x27;s entire portable notebook lineup (the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro) is Intel-free and running Apple-designed chips.



Apple&#x27;s MacBook Pro lineup is as follows:



 	
M1 13-inch MacBook Pro - $1299


 	
‌M1‌ Pro 14-inch MacBook Pro with 8-core CPU - $1999


 	
‌M1‌ Pro 14-inch MacBook Pro with 10-core CPU - $2499


 	
‌M1‌ Pro 16-inch MacBook Pro - $2499


 	
‌M1‌ Max 16-inch MacBook Pro - $3499




Intel chips continue to be available in desktop machines that include the Mac mini, iMac, and Mac Pro, but upgrades for all of those devices are in the works and expected next year.



On stage today, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that we&#x27;re one year into the two-year transition from Intel chips to Apple silicon, so we can expect most of the rest of the Mac lineup to get updated in 2022.



The new ‌M1‌ Pro and ‌M1‌ Max MacBook Pro models can be pre-ordered from the Apple Store starting today and are set to ship out next week.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/18/macbook-pro-14-inch-8-core-cpu/">

                    <span>Though Apple announced its M1 Pro chip with a 10-core CPU at today&#x27;s event, it turns out there is a lower-tier option available for the middle-tier 14-inch MacBook Pro.





The most affordable $1,999 ‌M1‌ Pro machine features an 8-core CPU and a 14-core GPU rather than a 10-core CPU and 16-core GPU. The version with a 10-core CPU and 16-core GPU is actually priced starting at $2,499.



Because there are two different 14-inch models with different ‌M1‌ Pro chips, Apple is also offering two separate power adapters. The 8-core CPU ‌M1‌ Pro MacBook Pro comes with a 67W power adapter and the 10-core model comes with a 96W power adapter.



The 67W power adapter is a new addition to Apple&#x27;s online store and is available for $59 on a standalone basis, while the 96W version was previously available and is priced at $79.



For the 16-inch MacBook Pro models, there&#x27;s also a middle-tier graphics option available as an upgrade. Both the entry-level and mid-level machines can be upgraded with an ‌M1‌ Max chip with 10-core GPU and 24-core GPU that&#x27;s a middle of the road option between the 16-core GPU and the 32-core GPU. Getting the 24-core GPU requires a $200 upgrade fee.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/18/apple-releases-polishing-cloth/">

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Apple today released a microfiber Polishing Cloth accessory, designed for cleaning the screens of Apple devices, for $19.





Although today&#x27;s &quot;Unleashed&quot; Apple event focused on the Mac in terms of hardware with a screen, Apple tables an expansive &quot;compatibility&quot; list on the Polishing Cloth&#x27;s store page, featuring iPhone, iPad, Mac, iPod touch, and Apple Watch models dating back several years.



Apple usually advises caution when cleaning its nano-texture glass option on the Pro Display XDR and 27-inch iMac, but the new cleaning cloth is apparently appropriate for use even on these displays.
Made with soft, nonabrasive material, the Polishing Cloth cleans any Apple display, including nano-texture glass, safely and effectively.




The Polishing Cloth was added to the Apple Store alongside the third-generation AirPods, new HomePod mini color options, and high-end MacBook Pro models and is available to order now. The polishing cloth does not come with the new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models, so if you want an Apple polishing cloth for these devices you will still need to purchase one separately.

                    <span>Apple has removed all references to the original, full-sized HomePod from its website, months after officially discontinuing the smart speaker that struggled to reach mainstream adoption.





The removal of references to the original ‌HomePod‌ came as a result of brand new changes to Apple&#x27;s website. With the new changes, Apple now only highlights the HomePod mini, which now comes in brand new colors. 



Apple announced ‌HomePod‌ in 2018 as its first major home-centric product, focused around delivering high-quality audio combined with the integration into services, such as Apple Music and Siri. 



Priced at $349 at launch and eventually decreased to $299, Apple struggled to market the ‌HomePod‌ in a way appealing to the masses, yielding lower sales than the company was likely aiming for. Additionally, ‌Siri‌, which powers the ‌HomePod‌ experience, continues to grapple with catching up to the capabilities of Google&#x27;s smart assistant and Amazon&#x27;s Alexa.



Apple followed up the full-sized ‌HomePod‌ with the ‌HomePod mini‌ last year, and today added new colors for the smaller speaker. The ‌HomePod mini‌ features a significantly smaller design than the original ‌HomePod‌, but continues to feature the same ‌Siri‌ experience, powered by ‌Apple Music‌ and third-party services. Unlike the original ‌HomePod‌ selling for $299, the ‌HomePod mini‌ is priced at $99. The ‌HomePod mini‌ recently became available in more countries, including Austria, Ireland, and New Zealand.

                    <span>In an update to the macOS Monterey features page on its website, Apple has indicated that the Universal Control feature previewed at WWDC 2021 will be available later this fall, which likely means it will be enabled in a future software update.





It&#x27;s not a surprise that Universal Control has been delayed beyond the initial release of macOS Monterey, which will be available Monday, October 25, as the feature was still not enabled in the latest macOS Monterey beta. Apple did add a &quot;beta&quot; label next to hidden Universal Control settings in System Preferences, suggesting that the feature will be considered a public beta when it launches, just like iCloud Private Relay on iOS 15.



Universal Control will allow for a single mouse, trackpad, and keyboard to be used across multiple Macs and/or iPads side by side.



Other new macOS Monterey features include AirPlay to Mac, a redesigned Safari browser, a Shortcuts app, spatial audio in FaceTime, and more. There is also a new SharePlay feature that will let Apple users watch TV, listen to music, and share their screens with one another, but like Universal Control, this feature is coming later this fall.

Compact mode is still an option, which is great — the way this design should have been approached all along. Safari 15 on iPadOS 15.1 comes along for the ride too.
We’re left with one single design mistake in Safari 15 across all platforms: the close buttons for tabs being on the right instead of the left on iPhone. Pretty good outcome given what was shown back at WWDC.

The return we’ve all been waiting for: Dave Hakstol is back behind the bench in Philadelphia at long last.
 It’s been three years since the Flyers hosted an expansion team, but that’ll change when the Seattle Kraken visit the Wells Fargo Center tonight. 
Seattle comes in as the NHL’s 32nd franchise, and one looking for the same success the Vegas Golden Knights found in a 3-2 win in their first-ever trip to Philadelphia back in March of 2018.



Much has changed since 2018, though a familiar face remains in the equation as Kraken head coach Dave Hakstol was the Flyers bench boss for that matchup with the Golden Knights. Hakstol was shown the door after posting a 277-134-101 mark with the Flyers, and waited a few years to earn another head coaching…</span>

The familiar face is coming back to his old stomping grounds on Monday.
 The Seattle Kraken coming east to visit the Philadelphia Flyers for the first time is exciting enough, just with them being the shiny new toy of the NHL, but it has another added aspect of importance for both clubs.
Kraken head coach Dave Hakstol is familiar enough with this city and franchise, after spending three and a half grueling and miserable seasons as the Flyers’ bench boss. Causing just about every fan of this team to have a daily reminder that they are stuck, immovable on a plateau of non-success. With zero playoff round victories to boast about during his tenure, there was hope that he would never be in the Wells Fargo Center again.
Well he’s here and causin…</span>

Is there cause for concern or did Carter Hart fall victim to a few bad bounces on opening night?
 We’re one game into the Philadelphia Flyers 2021-22 season and what else would the storyline be besides goaltending?
Carter Hart is coming off of the worst season in his short career –– and it was bad. Hart went 9-11-5 with a .877 save percentage and 3.67 goals against average in 27 games (25 starts). It was a far cry from the 40-26-4 record, .915 SV%, and 2.59 GAA he posted in his first two seasons (74 games, 70 starts).
This was a normal offseason for Hart, though, heading into a full 82-game season. A refreshed Hart and the Flyers also had their normal Training Camp, giving the netminder some time to prepare for the season.
All of that went out the wi…</span>

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *Dave Hakstol and his brand new team are in town tonight, and the Flyers will have an opportunity to build on Friday’s positives. Here’s what we know about the Kraken through three whole games. [The Seattle Times]
*Back to Friday, it was a loss, sure. There were some very... bad moments. But there were positives too. Stuff to learn. [BSH]
*It was an up and down performance from Carter Hart, too. It would appear that the team is giving him the foundation to build on though. [The Athletic]
*Speaking of building, this is a new mix of guys that need to build chemistry, and that takes time. And the injuries don’t help. [Inquirer]
*Oh yeah, we know what the goal song is now. There is simply no way fans picked this. [NBC Sports Philly]
*Yesterday afternoon it looked like we might see the debut of Rasmus Ristolainen tonight, but AV shut that down quickly. [NBC Sports Philly]
*Looking around the NHL at the players that stood out during opening week. [The Hockey News]
*And finally, the Hayes family shared the details of Jimmy’s passing yesterday, and the cause somehow made this already sad story even sadder. Very generous of his family to share the story, in the hopes that it might help someone else. [Boston Globe]</span>

One Pot French Onion Pasta with Crispy Prosciutto…the ultimate fall and winter comfort food. Think French onion soup with the addition of pasta, a creamy sauce, and melty Gruyere cheese. A little bit of wine is the secret to this one-pot pasta. It helps retain those classic French onion soup flavors we all love so…

Verified, playable with some tinkering, or forget it are your options
 Valve is introducing a rating system that will let players know which of Steam’s 50,000 games are compatible with the Steam Deck, the handheld gaming PC due to launch by the end of the year.
Steam Deck Verified, as the metric is called, will peg a game as fully compatible, partially compatible, or incompatible with the Steam Deck. Officially, these categories are verified, playable, unsupported, and unknown.
“Any verified game is a great, smooth experience on Deck,” says the narrator in the video above. Playable means “they’ll require a little more manual involvement to configure and play.” Unsupported means the game “just isn’t playable on Deck.” Unknown means the game hasn’t been evaluated yet for its Steam Deck playability.
Verified games have full controller support, support Steam Deck’s default resolution (1280x800 or 1280x720), and other basic capabilities. The first tab in the Steam Store, as shown on Steam Deck, will only show games that are “great on Deck.” Users’ game libraries will have compatibility badges shown prominently on each title.
Steam Deck Verified’s official page says Valve is reviewing the entire Steam catalog for its compatibility. A game’s rating may also change, as developers provide post-release support or options that include Steam Deck — or as Steam Deck’s software improves.
Steam Deck, announced in July, launches in December with units starting at $399. The handheld features a 7-inch touchscreen. Players can also purchase a dock that allows the Steam Deck to run on a TV, like the Nintendo Switch.
Storage, however, may be a big shortcoming for the Steam Deck. The base model only offers 64 GB; a $529 mid-level option has 256 GB of space; the top-shelf $649 Steam Deck has a 512 GB solid-state drive. Even though the unit can be opened up by users and the hard drives may be replaced, Valve is strongly recommending folks don’t do that.</span>

The Haunting event stars in Warzone and Black Ops Cold War Oct. 19
 Call of Duty’s annual Halloween event, The Haunting, returns this week in Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and Call of Duty: Warzone, bringing Ghostface from Scream — there’s a new one coming out — and Frank the Rabbit from Donnie Darko to the battlefield. And, yes, it appears that Frank can indeed drop a jet engine on his enemies with a new Donnie Darko-inspired finishing move.
There’s a lot of spooky content coming to Call of Duty’s The Haunting event, which runs from Oct. 19 to Nov. 2. In addition to the Ghostface operator and Frank the Rabbit skin for Baker, there are new cosmetics: the Necro Queen operator skin for Portnova, Disciple of Mayhem skin for Weaver, and Lum…</span>

Episode one of Arcane will drop on Netflix Nov. 6
 The first episode of Arcane, the League of Legends animated series from Riot Games and Netflix, will be co-streamable exclusively on Twitch, the companies announced on Monday.
The show, which premieres at 7 p.m. PDT on Nov. 6, will be accompanied by a “Global Premiere Event” to be broadcast by streamers in more than 30 countries, and is free to co-stream for all fans. The premiere event will include a red carpet pre-show from Riot Games headquarters in Los Angeles.
Arcane will have three acts, each three episodes long (so, nine in all). And unlike most Netflix shows, not all episodes will drop at once: Acts two and three of Arcane will debut on Netflix on Nov. 13 and Nov. 20, respectively.
As an incentive to watch episode one on Twitch, fans will get exclusive in-game items for Riot’s titles via Twitch drops during the show.
“The premiere of the show will be at the center of a global celebration for gamers and fans of the League of Legends IP,” Monday’s statement said. The League of Legends World Championship, which got underway Oct. 8, concludes on Nov. 6.; Riot’s news release noted that last year’s championship drew 49.45 million concurrent viewers, worldwide.
“Arcane dives into the delicate balance between the rich city of Piltover and the seedy underbelly of Zaun,” the news release said. “While Arcane holds the backstories of League of Legends champions, the series is designed to stand on its own as a complex world filled with moral decisions, breathtaking animation, and suspenseful storytelling.”</span>

The Simulacrum Pilot is coming to the Arena
 Ash is finally joining the Apex Games. The Titanfall 2 character is the next Legend Respawn Entertainment is adding to Apex Legends. 
Ash is a Simulacrum Pilot, or a robot with a human’s mind. In this case that human is Dr. Ashleigh Reid, the former partner and apprentice of Horizon — who she reunites with in Apex’s new “Stories from the Outlands” video. After Ashleigh betrayed Horizon and was eventually left for dead, she was turned into the Simulacrum Ash, who plays a key role as an antagonist in Titanfall 2. After her role in Titanfall, Ash made her way to Apex Legends and has been in charge of the Arena mode, but it’s finally time for her to join the action as a playable Legend.
One thing we don’t know yet is what exactly Ash’s kit will do. While she was a gifted Pilot in Titanfall 2, the Apex Legends version of the character will have both the Simulacrum’s memories and those of Dr. Reid, so it’s possible she could mix together her doctoral smarts and combat abilities when she finally hits the arena. 
Ash’s addition to Apex will be part of the game’s latest seasonal update: Escape. The new update will be released on Nov. 2 and will include map updates and a few additional surprises that Respawn hasn’t announced yet.</span>

Coming soon in two bundles; official date not set yet
 To no one’s surprise, Dune is the next big crossover with Fortnite. Insider HYPEX leaked nine themed items early Monday morning, and the film’s leading man, Timothée Chalamet, hit Instagram with a story showing his character, Paul Atreides, kitted out inside the battle royale.
The items include skins for both Paul and Chani, back bling for both (neither look that different, tbh), a “Sand Walk” emote, the Twinblades as a harvesting tool, and a hilarious loading screen. Probably the most apropos items, however, are the Ornithopter glider (but of course), and the Maker Hooks harvesting tools. Either would be center square on anyone’s crossover bingo card.

— HYPEX (@HYPEX) October 18, 2021



Dune premieres Oct. 22. There’s no specific launch date yet for these items, but it’s a good bet they’ll hit the game soon. When they do, HYPEX says they’ll be available in two bundles.
Chalamet (and his unruly hair) stars alongside Zendaya as Chani in Dune, whose first 10 minutes we saw in IMAX back in July (warning, spoilers there). Director Denis Villeneuve is looking to break through a dense canon and 55 years of inertia that has kept Frank Herbert’s epic from mainstream cinematic success.</span>

 The Grand Theft Auto Trilogy will be out by the end of the year, but Rockstar is still staying tight-lipped on all the details. However, fans are now hunting down some bonus facts about the upcoming collection and posting them around the internet,  specifically in the GTA forums. 
Prolific GTA data miner alloc8or — who recently data-mined the upcoming game’s achievements — has discovered some hidden text on Rockstar’s website that indicates some major improvements coming to Grand Theft Auto 3, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.

FromSoftware says its open-world game needs more time
 FromSoftware’s Elden Ring will be released on Feb. 25, 2022, developer and publisher Bandai Namco announced Monday. That’s a monthlong delay for the open-world action-RPG game, which was previously slated to launch in January.
On Twitter, the official Elden Ring account said that “the depth [and] strategic freedom of the game exceeded initial expectations,” leading to its delay.
“Please accept our sincere apologies for keeping you waiting,” FromSoftware said on its official Twitter account. “Your patience and understanding mean a great deal to us.”
To soften the pain of Elden Ring’s delay, FromSoftware and Bandai Namco announced a closed network test of the game’s multiplayer component that will run Nov. 12-14. Interested players can sign up for the beta test before Nov. 1 at the game’s website to take part.


Bandai Namco says that players who are selected for the closed network test will be able to experience the opening hours of Elden Ring during the following dates and times:
Nov. 12: 3 a.m. to 6 a.m. PST
Nov. 12: 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. PST
Nov. 13: 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. PST
Nov. 14: 3 a.m. to 6 a.m. PST
Nov. 14: 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. PST
Elden Ring was originally announced in June 2019 at E3. The fantasy action-role-playing game is a collaboration between FromSoftware and A Song of Ice and Fire author George R.R. Martin, and sends players to the Lands Between as a Tarnished to restore the titular Elden Ring and become the region’s new lord. For more on the game, check out Polygon’s Elden Ring preview. Elden Ring is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.</span>

                    <span>The next-generation MacBook Air that&#x27;s set to be released in 2022 will also feature a notch, according to the same leaker who was first to mention the notch coming to the 2021 MacBook Pro models.





In a forum post from August discussing the new MacBook Pro models, leaker Ty98 said that the next-generation ‌MacBook Air‌ will include the same notch that Apple is introducing for the MacBook Pro.



He also said that the ‌MacBook Air‌ will &quot;look much better&quot; as Apple plans to eliminate the current wedge design. The ‌MacBook Air‌ has long had a design that transitions from thicker at the back to thinner at the front. The leaker claims that the next ‌MacBook Air‌ will have a &quot;very round and light&quot; design.



Other ‌MacBook Air‌ rumors have indeed suggested that Apple is designing a thinner and lighter version of the machine with thinner bezels than the current model. It is expected to feature a 13-inch mini-LED display, several color options, and an updated version of the M1 chip.

                    <span>Last minute rumors that came out just days ago suggest that the MacBook Pro will feature a notch at the top for the 1080p webcam and ambient light sensor, but it turns out information about a notch was shared months ago by a Chinese leaker that may have been the source for several other rumors about the upcoming 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models.





In a forum post shared in August, &quot;ty98&quot; said that both MacBook Pro models will have a notch. He went on to provide several other details about the machines, including a mention of the 1080p webcams and the lack of Face ID, which we have previously heard from other leakers.



The leaker claims to have intimate knowledge of the new machines, and at one point, he said that he saw both the case of the MacBook Pro and its packagin…</span>

                    <span>Following a last-minute rumor that upcoming 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models could feature a notch at the top of the display, it has come to our attention that this design was potentially leaked in stolen schematics months ago.





Back in April, a ransomware group known as REvil publicly stated that it had gained access to internal information from Apple supplier Quanta Computer in Taiwan, and the group demanded payment in exchange for keeping the information private. Some of the information still leaked, including alleged schematics for unreleased MacBook Pro models that corroborated the return of an HDMI port, SD card slot, and MagSafe.



Now, we have learned that one of the schematics that leaked back in April shows a MacBook Pro display with a notch. In fact, the all…</span>

                    <span>A little more than 24 hours until Apple&#x27;s much-awaited launch of redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros, new evidence has emerged suggesting that Apple may be calling the chips that power the upcoming Macs &quot;M1 Pro&quot; and &quot;‌M1‌ Max.&quot;





The new MacBook Pros will be powered by the next generation of Apple silicon, featuring up to 10 CPU cores, with eight high-performance and two energy-efficient cores. In graphics, Apple is expected to include two variations of its upcoming chip, including 16 and 32 GPU cores. 



There&#x27;s been an ongoing debate regarding the name of Apple&#x27;s next-generation Mac silicon. Some have speculated that the chip may be called &quot;M1X,&quot; while others believe it could jump to &quot;M2&quot; to signify the more considerable leap in performance compared to the ‌M1‌.

                    <span>Following the last-minute rumor that Apple&#x27;s upcoming new MacBook Pro models could feature a notch at the top of the display, much of the online discussion has involved concerns that such a notch would encroach on the active screen area, potentially eating into the macOS menu bar.





However, it&#x27;s worth noting that Apple has explored ways of including a notch in a MacBook Pro display that would avoid ingression into the main screen area, make the notch appear seamless against a black strip, and potentially allow for additional information to be displayed to the user that would also free up menu bar space in the main 16:10 display.



For example, an Apple patent filed in 2019 with the U.S. patent office, titled &quot;Electronic Device Display With Extended Active Area,&quot; describes, a…</span>

Nine Favorite Things. As you can see, we finally had our first big snow of the season this week. It started on Sunday and pretty much continued throughout the week. Not any serious accumulation really, but man it was cold. Twenty degrees on Friday morning and I was freezing my butt off. Fortunately, we’ve warmed…

                    <span>Following a sketchy rumor that claimed the next MacBook Pro models could feature a notch at the top of the display, an alleged photo of a MacBook Pro with a notch was shared today by Weibo account AnyTurtle999, as spotted by Twitter account DuanRui. 





A close-up view of the alleged notch at the top of the image appears to show a FaceTime camera, microphone, and an ambient light sensor for True Tone. Earlier this week, a Reddit user claimed that the next MacBook Pro will not feature Face ID despite having a notch, with a Touch ID sensor expected to remain above the keyboard for authentication.



The photo is blurry and it&#x27;s unclear if it&#x27;s authentic, so some skepticism is warranted here. If the photo proves to be real, however, it suggests that the next MacBook Pro models could feature very thin bezels around the display.



In the macOS Monterey beta, MacRumors discovered potential display resolutions of 3024x1964 and 3456x2234 for the rumored 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models. When subtracting 74 pixels from the height of both, the resulting 3024x1890 and 3456x2160 resolutions work out to an aspect ratio of 16:10. All of Apple&#x27;s current MacBooks feature a 16:10 aspect ratio, leading to speculation that the extra 74 pixels could be for a notch.



Apple is hosting a virtual event on Monday at 10 a.m. Pacific Time, with rumors widely suggesting the event will be focused on redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with a faster version of the M1 chip and brighter mini-LED displays. The notebooks are also expected to feature an HDMI port, an SD card reader, and a magnetic power cable, while ditching the Touch Bar in favor of a return to physical Fn keys.

                    <span>Zoe Schiffer, writing for The Verge:
On October 14th, Apple fired a leader of the #AppleToo
movement for allegedly failing to comply with an internal
investigation. The employee, Janneke Parrish, has been working
behind the scenes for months to organize fellow employees who’ve
faced harassment and discrimination. […]
Q: What’s your view on why you were fired?
I believe I was fired in retaliation for speaking out, for my work
with #AppleToo, and out of concern that I was organizing to help
other employees tell their stories. In my view, this is entirely
retaliation for trying to bring Apple’s actions to light and
publicly asking the company to do better.
Unasked in the interview: whether Parrish actually leaked confidential company information. That seems pertinent when the stated reason for her firing was suspicion of leaking confidential company information.

Both bands are from Australia, both are playing extreme kinds of hardcore… Well yes maybe this tape looks like many other fast releases but to be honest this one hooked me up with its insane energy and sincerity. Endless Bore starts this fight. What can I say, their hardcore have a great charge of groove and energy. Actually, this is more thrashcore than classical hardcore, but anyway, this noise is hot!

Some observations for your morning...
 The Flyers are back, gang! No, really, they are back. They opened up their season last night against the Canucks with a truly classic Flyers performance—they got off to a really strong start and carried an early lead into the second, only to give up three goals in the first half of the second period. In a 4-2 hole as the final five minutes of the third period hit, they turned on the jets, and managed a comeback (care of Travis Konecny on the power play, and Claude Giroux on the 6-on-5). It was an exciting push, rewarded with a loss in the shootout, because of course. 
All the same, it’s good to be back.

The first season opener at home in years felt like a new start.
 It was 4PM Friday afternoon and I still wasn’t sure I was going to go to this game. The last time I was at the Wells Fargo Center for a Flyers game it was sometime in 2018 — my longest stretch without seeing a game in person in nearly a decade. 
A million things kept me home. The lackluster performances from the team. The long drive from Wilmington, where I used to live. The comfy couch and big television. The free snacks at home. The still-too-high prices for tickets and parking. And then a move to Canada. And then a pandemic. 
So yesterday, as I contemplated pulling the trigger on a treat-yo-self lower level seat, nearly $200 after fees, I sighed. I looked at my comfy couch. My big TV. I thought about…</span>

Flashes of brilliance, frustration, incredible misfortune, a furious rally to tie it, and a shootout loss. We’re back, babies.
 Prior to the events that took place in the final two and a half minutes of regulation in the Flyers’ season-opening 5-4 shootout loss to the Vancouver Canucks, this paragraph here (which I, as many do when they write a recap, had already written most of as a placeholder) said the following:
The first game of the Flyers’ 2021-22 season brought new faces, excitement, a full crowd, and a hot start, and then ... a lot of hockey that looked like it was played by the 2020-21 Flyers. One game is just that, and it’d be silly to read too much int…</span>

The Batman game without Batman re-emerges
 The creators of Gotham Knights, the open-world action RPG set in a wayward Gotham City without its Batman, offered a new, longer look at their game at the 2021 DC FanDome on Saturday. It’s our first peek at the game in more than a year, revealing what Robin, Nightwing, Batgirl, and the Red Hood will get up to in 2022.
The FanDome preview showed off a brief look at the game where Nightwing, Robin, Batgirl, and Red Hood are captured by the Court of Owls. After the short cinematic trailer, there was a special behind-the-scenes preview that gave fans a look at the history of the Court and let its creators, and the developers behind Gotham Knights, explain the secret society’s history in Gotham City and how it will fit into the new game. 


Gotham Knights was officially revealed at the inaugural DC FanDome last year. Set after Bruce Wayne’s death, playable heroes Robin, Nightwing, Batgirl, and the Red Hood will contend with classic Batman villains like Mr. Freeze, as well as a powerful new threat: the Court of Owls, a generations-long conspiracy of Gotham City’s wealthiest families.
Originally expected in 2021, Gotham Knights is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X, in 2022. The third-person action game, developed by Batman: Arkham Origins studio WB Games Montreal, will be playable solo or in co-op.</span>

The band of anti-heroes are ready to take on the strongest members of the DC Universe 
 Rocksteady Studios, the team behind the groundbreaking Batman Arkham games, is taking on the Suicide Squad in its next game. That team of lovable misfits is tasked with taking down the Justice League, who have been brainwashed by the supervillain Brainiac. Logically, that game is called Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, and Rocksteady revealed more about the open-world action game at DC FanDome on Saturday.
Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League will star four (now) well-known anti-heroes — Harley Quinn, Deadshot, Captain Boomerang, and King Shark — on a mission to take down not just Brainiac, but evil versions of DC heroes like Superman too. The Squad will fight in across an open-world Metropolis that’s set in Rocksteady’s established “Arkham-verse.”
Rocksteady’s next game was revealed at last year’s DC FanDome. At this year’s version of the DC Comics fan event, we got another cinematic preview of the game but still no gameplay — Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League will offer both single-player and multiplayer cooperative gameplay.
Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is set to be released for PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X in 2022.</span>

                    <span>Folks who live on 15th Street in the Richmond district of San Francisco report that an abnormal number of Google’s self-driving cars are ending up swirling around at the end of their street.
“I noticed it while I was sleeping,” says Jennifer King. “I awoke to a strange hum and I thought there was a spacecraft outside my bedroom window.”
The visitors Jennifer King is talking about don’t just come at night. They come all day, right to the end of 15th Avenue, where there’s nothing else to do but make some kind of multi-point turn and head out the way they came in. Not long after that car is gone, there will be another, which will make the same turn and leave, before another car shows up and does the exact same thing. And while there are some pauses, it never really stops.
“There are some days where it can be up to 50,” King says of the Waymo count. “It’s literally every five minutes. And we’re all working from home, so this is what we hear.”

14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro Models


It&#x27;s been two years since the 16-inch MacBook Pro models last saw a refresh, and we&#x27;re long overdue for an update. We&#x27;ve been hearing rumors about significantly redesigned 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro models for many months now, making this one of…</span>

                    <span>With the launch of the iPhone 12 models last year, Apple introduced a $129 MagSafe Duo Charger that&#x27;s able to charge an iPhone and an Apple Watch at the same time, but it&#x27;s unfortunately already outdated.





The Apple Watch Series 7 has a new fast charging feature that requires an updated charging puck, and that means the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ does not fast charge when connected to the ‌MagSafe‌ Duo as it uses a standard non-fast charge puck.



Apple confirmed that the ‌MagSafe‌ Duo is not able to fast charge an ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ in a support document updated this afternoon.
MagSafe Duo Charger doesn&#x27;t support fast charging with Apple Watch Series 7. To fast charge your Apple Watch Series 7, use the Apple USB-C Magnetic Fast Charging Cable.
Apple may have an updated version of the ‌MagSafe‌ Duo that supports Apple Watch fast charging coming in the future, but ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ owners who already own the current version will need to settle for standard charging speeds.

Compared to the Series 6, there&#x27;s not a whole lot new with the Series 7. You&#x27;re not getting new health features, and even the design is largely the same. The casing sizes are larger, though, coming in at 41mm and 45mm, and there&#x27;s a noticeably larger display.



Apple has cut down on the size of the display bezels and it&#x27;s a change that looks nice, plus the expanded size allows for features like…</span>

                    <span>The Apple Watch Series 7 models lack a diagnostic port under the band, which means Apple has to use another means to troubleshoot and restore Apple Watches that come in for repair.





‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ models are equipped with a module that enables 60.5GHz wireless data transfer as we discovered in FCC documents in September, with that data transfer capability designed to be used with a proprietary magnetic dock.



The dock was mentioned in one of the FCC filings, but we didn&#x27;t have a clear visual of it until now. Brazilian regulatory agency Anatel has approved the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ models and provided photos of the dock that Apple is using internally, with the information shared by Brazilian site &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://macmagazine.com.br/post/2021/10/15/anatel-homologa-versoes-celular-do-apple-watch-series-7/

&quot;&gt;MacMagazine.



The ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ dock is clearly designed for diagnostics, and it has a two piece construction. An Apple Watch charging puck fits into the bottom piece, and then a second piece housing the Apple Watch itself fits over that and aligns with bolts.





Prior to the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌, Apple included a diagnostic port on Apple Watch models, with the port hidden under the band. It&#x27;s not clear why Apple has shifted to wireless diagnostics, and it&#x27;s also not known how fast the wireless data transfer is. It likely uses USB 2.0 with speeds up to 480Mb/s.




The diagnostic port on Apple Watch Series 6 models and older


There is no word on whether the wireless data module added to the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ could ever have a consumer-facing application, but for now, it&#x27;s for Apple&#x27;s internal use only.

                    <span>Apple&#x27;s redesigned MacBook Pro models could feature a notch containing the webcam, according to a sketchy last-minute rumor that is circulating online.



MacRumors&#x27; render of a next-generation MacBook Pro with a notch.


The rumor appears to have originated from a Weibo user in China, who stipulates that the redesigned MacBook Pro will feature a notch. It apparently has a size &quot;similar to iPhone 12.&quot; The Twitter user known as &quot;DuanRui,&quot; who often shares information about Apple&#x27;s plans from Weibo, suggested that the rumor could simply be a joke. That being said, a Reddit user with no track-record, who professes to have spoken with supply chain sources, has now made the same claim.



The Reddit post says that the new MacBook Pro will feature a standard-sized notch rather than the…</span>

                    <span>Apple is hosting a virtual event on Monday at 10 a.m. Pacific Time, with rumors widely suggesting the event will be focused on redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with a faster version of the M1 chip, brighter mini-LED displays, and more.





In an investor note with Wedbush today, shared with MacRumors, analyst Dan Ives said third-generation AirPods will likely be announced at the event as well. The new AirPods are rumored to feature a similar design as the AirPods Pro, but without Active Noise Cancellation, and they could have improved sound quality and some other new features.



The third-generation AirPods have already been manufactured and are ready to launch, according to Wedbush&#x27;s supply chain checks, which increases the likelihood that they will be announced during the Apple Event next week.



Earlier this week, an account on Chinese social media platform Weibo known as @PandaIsBald also claimed that third-generation AirPods will be announced at the Apple Event next week. Last month, the same account accurately revealed that Apple would announce the ninth-generation iPad at its September event.



This would be the first update to the standard AirPods since the second-generation AirPods were released in March 2019. The second-generation AirPods are priced at $159 with a wired charging case and at $199 with a wireless charging case.



An update to the AirPods Pro is not expected until next year.

                    <span>Ahead of Monday&#x27;s Apple event, which is expected to include the much-awaited launch of brand new 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pros, Intel is continuing its long-running campaign to try and convince Mac users to switch to Intel-based PCs.





Last week, Intel released a video as part of its PC vs. Mac campaign that featured &quot;Apple fans&quot; introduced to different Intel computers and all of their features. During the four-minute video, Intel attempted to paint Apple consumers as oblivious to &quot;innovations&quot; made by companies besides Apple, including &quot;touch screen&quot; laptops.



Continuing its streak, yesterday, the official Intel account tweeted out, &quot;Confessions of former Mac users. What made you #GoPC?&quot; Instead of former Mac users engaging with the tweet on reasons they switched to PC, the t…</span>

                    <span>Parallels Desktop 17.1 for Mac has just been released, offering improved support for Windows 11 virtual machines and added stability via the default implementation of Virtual Trusted Platform Modules (vTPMs) for &quot;all future and past Windows 11 VMs.&quot; Parallels 17.1 also fully supports macOS Monterey as a host OS and improves the user experience when running ‌macOS Monterey‌ in a VM on M1 Macs.  





Windows 11 requires a hardware-based TPM chip to run, which limits the software&#x27;s compatibility with older PC computers and prevents it from running via Boot Camp on Intel Macs. Meanwhile there is no Boot Camp feature on Macs with Apple silicon, and the ARM-based version of Windows 11 is not natively supported.

                    <span>WhatsApp end-to-end encrypted backups are now rolling out for iPhone users, Facebook has announced. Until now, WhatsApp let users back up their chat history to ‌‌iCloud‌‌, but the messages and media contained in the backups weren&#x27;t protected by WhatsApp&#x27;s end-to-end encryption while in ‌‌Apple&#x27;s cloud servers‌. 





Since Apple holds the encryption keys for ‌‌iCloud‌‌ Backup, a subpoena of Apple or an unauthorized ‌‌iCloud‌‌ hack could have potentially allowed access to WhatsApp messages backed up there. Apple was reportedly pressured to not add encryption to ‌‌iCloud‌‌ Backups after the FBI complained.



Going forward, however, users can create a password or 64-bit key to protect their backup in cloud-based storage, whether they&#x27;re saved in ‌iCloud‌ or Google Drive.

                    <span>More than a dozen prominent cybersecurity experts hit out at Apple on Thursday for relying on &quot;dangerous technology&quot; in its controversial plan to detect child sexual abuse images on iPhones (via The New York Times).





The damning criticism came in a new 46-page study by researchers that looked at plans by Apple and the European Union to monitor people&#x27;s phones for illicit material, and called the efforts ineffective and dangerous strategies that would embolden government surveillance.



Announced in August, the planned features include client-side (i.e. on-device) scanning of users&#x27; iCloud Photos libraries for Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM), Communication Safety to warn children and their parents when receiving or sending sexually explicit photos, and expanded CSAM guidan…</span>

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/14/apple-watch-series-7-fast-charge-adapter/">

                    <span>The Apple Watch Series 7 includes a new charging architecture that allows it to refuel up to 33% faster than the Series 6, charging from 0 to 80% in 45 minutes.





The fast-charging capability requires a new USB-C charging cable that Apple includes in the box with the watch and also sells separately, but until now Apple hasn&#x27;t provided details on what wattage of power adapter is required for fast charging. Apple no longer includes a power adapter in the box with the Apple Watch, so users will need to provide their own.



In a new support document published today just as the first Apple Watch Series 7 orders have started arriving, Apple reveals that any of its USB-C power adapters rated at 18 watts or higher will support fast charging on the new watch. In addition, third-party USB-C adapters rated at 5 watts or higher will allow for fast charging as long as they support the USB Power Delivery (USB-PD) protocol.
Fast charging requires an Apple USB-C Magnetic Fast Charging Cable. This cable has aluminum around the magnetic charger and a USB-C connector.



You also need one of these power adapters:


Apple 18W, 20W, 29W, 30W, 61W, 87W, or 96W USB-C Power Adapter


A comparable third-party USB-C power adapter that supports USB Power Delivery (USB-PD) of 5W or greater

Apple says that fast charging is not available in Argentina, India, or Vietnam, but the company has not offered a reason for this limitation.

                    <span>Reuters:
Apple Inc was on a collision course with South Korea on Friday
over new requirements that it stop forcing app developers to use
its payment systems, with a government official warning of a
possible investigation into the iPhone maker’s compliance. […]
The law went into effect last month but Apple had told the South
Korean government that it was already complying and did not need
to change its app store policy, a Korea Communications Commission
(KCC) official in charge of the matter told Reuters.
“This goes against the purpose of the amended law,” the official
said, requesting anonymity as the KCC was still in talks with
Apple on compliance. […]
Google had informed the KCC that it planned to comply with the
law, including allowing third-party payment systems, and would
discuss the matter with the regulator starting next week, the KCC
official said.
Apple telling South Korea that they’re already in compliance reminds of the “I told them we’ve already got one” bit from Monty Python and the Holy Grail.

                    <span>Jason Snell, Six Colors:
And then macOS Monterey beta 10 dropped this week, and would you
look at this:
Yep, that’s the Safari Favorites Bar, now located above
the tabs.
Apple similarly moved the Favorites Bar above the tabs in Safari on iPadOS 15.1 beta 4, too.
The full Bookmarks menu on iPad, alas, still remains hidden in the sidebar. That’s a weird one. In the initial WWDC previews, the Bookmarks toolbar button was removed in Safari on both iOS and iPadOS. In the late summer redesign of Safari 15 for iOS, the Bookmarks toolbar button (which you tap to access a hierarchical menu showing all your bookmarks, and which, crucially, remembers which folder you were in the next time you use it) was back where it belongs: in Safari’s bottom-of-the-screen toolbar.
Yet on iPad — which has much more room for toolbar buttons than iPhone — Bookmarks are still squirreled away in the sidebar that is primarily intended for creating, managing, and switching between Tab Groups. Tab Groups are a clever and I think useful new feature. Bookmarks do not belong over there though. Worse, every time you use the Bookmarks menu over in the sidebar on iPadOS 15, you have to navigate from the root level of your bookmarks each time. It doesn’t remember which folder you were in.
Here’s hoping that more changes to Safari 15 are coming, on both Mac and iPad.

                    <span>This coming Monday, Apple is having an event they are referring to as &quot;Unleashed&quot;. The general rumor is this will be an announcement of new MacBook Pros with faster M1 based processors.
That&#x27;d be great, but what I really want is some sort of M1/M1X/M2 based iMac Pro with a big display. It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve bought a new desktop (I&#x27;m still rocking a late 2015 iMac for some reason), and I&#x27;m eager for something newer and faster. Hopefully we&#x27;ll also get a release day for MacOS Monterey.
One thing that I haven&#x27;t seen remarked upon much, is that it&#x27;s been few weeks since a new beta of Xcode 13 dropped with a Monterey SDK to build against. This makes me think that there will be new APIs for dealing with some sort of new hardware in whatever is coming out Monday. So whatever we&#x27;re getting, I bet it&#x27;s going to be a little more involed than just a standard hardware upgrade.</span>

The games count; time to get stressed.
 It’s that time of the year again. Your Philadelphia Flyers are finally playing meaningful NHL hockey again, opening the season at home (wait, you can do that?) against the Vancouver Canucks. We’re excited to bring you yet another season of high-quality coverage, jokes, and pre/post-game jams, starting with this preview. Let’s dive in.



The Canucks
After going 2-5 in the preseason and starting off their regular season with a 3-2 loss in the shootout to Connor McDavid’s Edmonton Oilers, the Canucks travel to Philly in search of their first win. This is a weird Vancouver team from all angles, with a few stars and not much else providing hope for a big rebound season after a dismal follow-up to their…</span>

It’s the first trip down memory lane of the season, and it begins with a bang.
 As we dawn on another season of Flyers hockey and look towards the future, we take a brief moment to look into the past. This will be the first time the two teams have faced off since November 2019, almost two full years. There aren’t a ton of memorable moments between the Flyers and the Canucks considering they play in opposite conferences, but there are a few gems here and there.
One being a late November night in 1998 when one of the greatest goal scorers in Flyers history lit the lamp 4 times in one game, part of his fourth consecutive 40 goal season. Through the first two periods though, no one would have guessed this was coming. Vancouver took an early lead with a shorthanded goal fr…</span>

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *Folks, we did it! We made it to opening day 2021-22, which to be honest is a victory in and of itself. Unfortunately, not all the Flyers made it. Did you think any of this would be easy you silly goose?! Anyway, no Rasmus tonight. Several Phantoms. Let’s get wild. [Inquirer]
*Several things have gone wrong over the last week or so and it’s a little annoying! [NBC Sports Philly]
*At the end of the day, though, we need Carter Hart to be Carter Hart. That’s the whole deal here. [Inquirer]
*Charlie’s made his bold predictions for the season ahead of tonight’s game. [The Athletic]
*We made some predictions too, about the Flyers’ team awards. [BSH]
*Patrick Brown won’t be in the lineup tonight (Covid protocol), but he seems psyched to be in Philly so that’s nice. [NBC Sports Philly]
*Did you catch our interview with Alain Vigneault? If not, you should. [BSH]
*And finally, no better way to kill the time until the Flyers hit the ice than a brand new Flyperbole! The boys preview the season. It’s great. [BSH]</span>

                    <span>Originally written as a Facebook post in the wake of the 2016 election, Timothy Snyder’s On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century went on to become a bestseller and a prescient warning on what was to come for America. Now, a graphic edition of On Tyranny has been released, designed and illustrated by Nora Krug. From Steven Heller’s piece on the book in Print:
Krug’s goal for this project was to use her medium to echo Snyder’s call for action. “While it was important to me to create images that would highlight the contemporary relevance of Snyder’s message,” she writes, “the use of historic images was clearly essential. At moments in the book that refer to a particular event in time — such as this one about Hitler’s annexation of Austria, when Austrian Nazis captured Jews and forced them to scrub the streets clean — I felt that rather than showing my own visual representation of that event, it was more powerful to feature a historic photograph because of the immediacy of the medium that would make that moment in history come to life.”
Combining Krug’s drawings with historic materials gave her the license to contrast the documentary with the imagined, the factual with the poetic, and to create a narrative tension that emphasizes historical relationships. “More importantly,” she explains, “this combination of mediums allows me to admit to the fact that we don’t exist in a vacuum, that we can only exist in relationship to the past, that everything we think and feel is thought and felt in reference to it, that our future is deeply rooted in our history, and that we will always be active contributors to shaping how the past is viewed and what our future will look like.”


You can order the graphic version of On Tyranny here but it seems to be backordered in most places.

                    <span>In a two-part video series called Trans Dudes From History, Jackson Bird tells us about some historical people who were probably transgender or transmasculine.
Trans people have always existed, even if they didn’t have the same language we do now and even if most history books won’t tell you about them. In this first volume of my Trans Dudes From History series, I give an introduction to talking about people from history who maybe could’ve been trans and share the profiles of three people — a Spanish conquistador, a stagecoach driver, and a bronco buster — who all transgressed gender in some way.


The introduction in the first video (embedded above) — about history and how we even know people were trans before the language around that was even invented — is really interesting. Part two of Trans Dudes From History is right here.

                    <span>You’ve probably seen it: a dual-tubed generator console that’s appeared in movies and TV shows like Star Trek (all of them, pretty much), Knight Rider, V, Austin Powers, The Last Starfighter, and even Airplane II. This prop was originally built in the 70s and in the decades since has been placed in scenes requiring an impressive piece of high-tech equipment. The video above is a compilation of scenes in which the console has appeared (parts two &amp; three of the compilation).

                    <span>It&#x27;s Friday, October 15 in New Zealand and Australia, which means it&#x27;s Apple Watch Series 7 launch day. Customers in that part of the world are always the first to get their hands on new devices due to time zone differences.





‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ models are now beginning to arrive to customers who pre-ordered on Friday, October 8, and new Apple Watch owners are sharing photos on Instagram, Twitter, Reddit, and the MacRumors forums.

Because there are no Apple Stores in New Zealand, customers in Australia will be the first to be able to pick up a new Apple Watch at an Apple retail location. In-store stock in Australia will give us an idea of what we can expect in other stores worldwide, which may be of particular interest this year because Apple Watch supplies are so constrained.



Many of the Apple Watch models began selling out shortly after pre-orders began, so customers who are hoping not to have to wait several weeks for one of the devices may be able to get one in-store on launch day.



Following New Zealand and Australia, sales and deliveries of the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ will begin in Middle East, Europe, and then North America. Apple Stores‌ globally are opening up right around 8:00 a.m. local time to allow customers to pick up reserved devices and make walk-in purchases.



Stay tuned to MacRumors tomorrow because we&#x27;ll have an ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ review and comparison, along with more coverage coming next week. If you have a new ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌, make sure to share photos below and let us know what you think!

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/14/apple-new-audio-software-lead-homepod/">

                    <span>Apple has hired a new software lead for the HomePod team as part of an effort to better compete with smart home speakers from Amazon and Google, reports Bloomberg.




The Syng Cell Alpha


Afrooz Family, an audio engineer who worked at Apple from 2012 to 2016 has rejoined the company and is leading software development on the ‌HomePod‌/Apple TV team. Family co-founded speaker company Syng alongside former Apple design team member Christoper Stringer. Syng is known for the super expensive Cell Alpha, which boasts &quot;triphonic&quot; audio technology that&#x27;s able to create an immersive, dynamic sound field.



Apple has struggled to get the ‌HomePod‌ to catch on since its launch in 2018. The initial version of the speaker was priced at $350 and boasted higher-quality audio than competitors, but it was just not as popular as much more affordable smart speaker options from Samsung and Google.



The original ‌HomePod‌ was discontinued earlier this year with Apple instead opting to focus on the $99 HomePod mini, which is smaller and much more appealing due to its lower price tag.



Going forward, Apple plans to create a combined ‌HomePod‌, ‌Apple TV‌, and FaceTime device that will serve as an all-in-one entertainment option. According to Bloomberg, such a device could be released as early as 2023.

                    <span>Apple today seeded a new beta of Safari 15.1 for macOS Big Sur and macOS Catalina, allowing developers to test the new Safari update ahead of its launch. Safari 15.1 is also the version of Safari that&#x27;s available in the macOS Monterey beta.





In yesterday&#x27;s macOS Monterey release, Apple tweaked the design of the Favorites bar, moving it back up above the Tab bar where it was before Safari changes were implemented with the ‌macOS Monterey‌ update and the Safari 15 release. Safari 15.1 includes the same tweak to the Favorites bar. 



Apple in ‌macOS Monterey‌ overhauled the look of Safari, debuting a new tab design that has proven to be unpopular with users. Apple has been refining the Safari design since then, and the changes coming in Monterey were made available to ‌macOS Big Sur‌ and macOS Catalina users with the launch of Safari 15.



Registered developers can download the Safari 15.1 beta by logging in and then navigating to the More Downloads section. The latest versions of ‌macOS Big Sur‌ or macOS Catalina are required to install the beta.

In this scenario, Apple can&#x27;t just reset your password for you, especially if your have two-factor authentication enabled. Setting up a recovery is one alternative solution, however in such cases you can&#x27;t change your password unless you have a trusted second device as well as the recovery key.

                    <span>Since its launch in 2007, the price of the iPhone has gone up more than 80% around the world, according to a new study that looked at ‌iPhone‌ prices all over the world and their increase and decrease over the years.





According to the study conducted by Self, since its launch in 2007 and subsequent annual upgrades, the price of iPhones has increased more than 80%, now costing over $400 more on average to buy in countries around the world compared to the original ‌iPhone‌. 

Since its US launch in 2007 and subsequent years in other countries, iPhone prices have increased by 81% across the globe. This means that in 2021, the latest flagship iPhone model costs $437 more to buy in each of the 38 countries it&#x27;s available in than it used to.
While the price increase comes alongside more advanced technology and increases in production costs, the increase also comes as a result of inflation and Apple having to sometimes increase prices to counter economic growth. 

However, many countries have experienced inflation and growth in purchasing power in the years between, and our research shows that Apple have risen iPhone prices 26% higher than local inflation rates. This means that local affordability for a flagship iPhone costs people around the world $154 more in real terms than the first models they could purchase.
As part of its research, Self has created an interactive map that highlights the changes in ‌iPhone‌ prices in real-world terms as a percentage of GDP over the last 14 years in more than 30 countries around the world. According to that map, the United Arab Emirates has witnessed the largest increase in the price of the ‌iPhone‌, with the latest model costing more than double what it did when it originally launched.

                    <span>The Apple Watch Series 7 officially hits the shelves and starts arriving with customers worldwide tomorrow. While we have seen media reviews of the new watch, we&#x27;ve yet to see a clear real-world comparison to last year&#x27;s Apple Watch Series 6 until now.





Apple says the new ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ features a 20% larger screen than the Series 6, primarily thanks to reduced bezels that allow the screen to slightly curve at the edges. Apple has a side-by-side comparison of the Series 7 to the Series 6 on its website, but for an apparent, real-world look, an image has now been shared on Twitter.



The image clearly shows the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ featuring a noticeably larger display than the Series 6, despite the case size only increasingly slightly. To take advantage of the larger display, Apple has updated watchOS&#x27;s user interface to include larger buttons, as well as a full on-screen QWERTY keyboard.



Alongside its larger display, the ‌‌Apple Watch Series 7‌‌ also features faster charging and improved durability. Learn everything you need to know about the Series 7 using our guide.

                    <span>Keith Broni, writing for Emojipedia:
Microsoft users subscribed to the Windows Insiders program can now install beta build introducing the much-anticipated new Fluent emoji set.
It is under-remarked upon just how much better Apple’s emoji are than everyone else’s. Related factoid: Apple’s emoji went through the great post-iOS 7 flattening and de-texturizing of user interfaces without being flattened or de-texturized.

It had slow metal parts, fast as fuck grinding moments, typical crustcore with dual vocals, some vintage hardcore, some distinctively anarcho references… It makes one think of early Napalm Death, Extreme Noise Terror, Electro Hippies, Disrupt, Anti-System, Disorder, Deviated Instinct but at the same time, it never feels like a …</span>

The visual part of this lovely EP reminds me of illustrations of old science fiction novels by authors such as Isaac Asimov, Robert Sheckley, Robert Anson Heinlein. This is really not a standard art as for a grindcore release and I love the result! You can not believe me but this small vinyl is full of aggression and hate, these 13 songs are a trip to …</span>

Which Flyers will take home annual team awards at the end of the season?
 Each year the Flyers hand out end-of-season awards for various accomplishments ranging from most valuable player to most improved and even the classiest guy. While we’d choose to give out superlatives more in the form of a most likely to drop pass on a breakaway, most likely to give up goals on three or more consecutive shots, or even least valuable player. 
Thankfully, this is our site and we can do whatever the hell we want. Actual Flyers award predictions up top followed by the reverse in those same categories at the bottom.

*The above move was coupled with Kevin Hayes being added to the LTIR, which wasn’t much of a surprise. At least Kevin has all his pals here with him to keep his spirits up. [Inquirer]
*It’s Flyers Hockey Eve, finally, which feels like a good time for an in-depth preview of this season. [BSH]
*Alain Vigneault plans to start the playoff push tomorrow, which seems like a solid plan to be honest. [NBC Sports Philly]

*Speaking of ESPN, hockey coverage is being ramped up all around, which is awesome, and leading off is this story on Auston Matthews. Who is very clearly anything but boring. [ESPN]
*According the Gary Bettman only four NHL players remain unvaccinated, which is just great. Really great effort to ensure the safety of the players and staff this season. [ProHockeyTalk]
*Let’s talk about all the reasons why each NHL team will not win the Stanley Cup this year. [Sportsnet]

Seek out these gems
 Digital versions of Where’s Waldo? or I-Spy, also known as hidden object games, are mechanically simple yet dizzyingly complex. The premise of finding items hidden in crowded spaces can create visual puzzles out of static pages; most of the work in playing a hidden object game happens with the eyes and brain.
In recent years, the hidden object genre has begun to evolve. The core gameplay — spotting things in cluttered rooms — is branching out in new directions: story-heavy dramas, surrealist worlds, even adventure gameplay. There’s never been a better time to seek out the genre.


We’ve compiled a list of the best hidden object games you can play across all platforms — Windows PC, Mac, console, and mobile. Some of them may not be consider…</span>

The original game’s code and an ever-growing player base are continuing issues for Diablo 2’s servers, says Blizzard
 Diablo 2: Resurrected has had server issues since it launched last month, but recently they’ve gotten even worse. After more than a week of crashes and outages, Blizzard has released a long and in-depth blog post describing the issues, what’s causing them, and how its team plans on fixing them. 
All of the Diablo 2 remake’s server problems are being caused by a series of smaller issues stacked on top of each other, Blizzard’s post explains, which means there isn’t just one solution to fixing them. One problem that might seem surprising is the sheer number of players that Blizzard is dealing with. Diablo 2: Resurrected is still hitting …</span>

343 Industries finally banishes the game’s Windows Vista issues
 Halo: The Master Chief Collection’s eighth and final season just hit the game on Wednesday, adding maps and cosmetics for players ahead of Halo Infinite’s launch on Dec. 8. But the update also includes some big changes to Halo 2, offering graphical improvements to the 17-year-old video game.
Halo 2 had some issues in the The Master Chief Collection. Specifically, it took some of the major graphical flaws from the Windows Vista version of the game and ported them into  343 Industries’ historical Halo package. Generalkidd, a Halo YouTuber, broke down some of the biggest changes in a new video.


Generalkidd called out lighting fixes and crossfades, and general visual changes that bring it closer to the original Halo 2. There’s also footage of a major bug fix in the Halo 2 level “The Great Journey,” where a Brute would classically flip a Wraith, rendering it nonlethal to the player. With season 8, the Brute has learned to drive properly, and now poses a threat. Ghosts also self-destruct properly now, an issue that’s been present in the Master Chief Collection since its launch in 2014.
The video goes over a whole host of similar changes, and is definitely worth a watch for potential Halo historians. These changes may seem small to many players — and they are, for the most part. But with Halo: The Master Chief Collection acting as a history of one of the most influential and important video game franchises of all time, it’s nice that Halo 2 finally looks like Bungie intended back in 2004.</span>

EA Sports will replace Jon Gruden with a generic character and name
 NFL players who get kicked off their teams for bad acts are taken out of the Madden NFL video game somewhat routinely. The game maintains an official roster for ranked competition, and it reflects who is active and who isn’t in the real world. But in what appears to be a first, EA Sports is yanking a coach off its virtual sideline.
That would be the disgraced Jon Gruden, ex-head coach of the Las Vegas Raiders, who resigned on Monday after a lengthy history of racist, sexist, homophobic, and otherwise ugly emails came to light. The emails were part of a league investigation…</span>

Here are the first details and trailer for Treyarch’s latest World War II take on zombies
 Zombies are back with this year’s Call of Duty: Vanguard. Activision, Sledgehammer Games, and Treyarch launched a trailer for the mode Thursday morning, offering players their first look at some old-school zombie-slaying action. While Sledgehammer is developing the majority of Call of Duty: Vanguard, the Zombies mode will be a Treyarch joint — the studio behind the original undead experience, dating all the way back to 2008’s Call of Duty: World at War.
With a return to the World War II setting, it looks like we’re going to get some more occult action in Vanguard’s Zombies. The trailer shows a Nazi captain named Von List using a special relic to…</span>

                    <span>The fossil record has provided us with so much information about plants, animals, and organisms that lived hundreds, thousands, millions, and even billions of years ago. But we are actually only seeing evidence of a tiny fraction of the species that lived then and even for those we do know about, there’s often much we still don’t know. Traditionally, dinosaurs have been depicted as drab and often terrible lizards but recent finds of soft tissues (skin, feathers, etc.) and an increased sense of imagination based on our current vibrant biodiversity has people thinking differently about how they looked and behaved.

                    <span>If you’re even just a little bit interested in The Beatles, popular music, or making creative work, The Beatles: Get Back looks really good. Directed by Peter Jackson and utilizing dozens of hours of footage shot in 1969, this six-hour series documents the Beatles recording Let It Be, their final studio album release, and playing their infamous rooftop concert. The series premieres on Disney+ on November 25 and an accompanying book is out now.
Previously: a six-minute preview of the series introduced by Jackson.

                    <span>In trying to explain what you’re about to see here, I cannot improve upon the Dr. Adrian Smith’s narration at the beginning of this video:
But sometimes I think the most useful thing I can do as a scientist is to point the fancy science cameras at some moths flapping their wings in front of a purple backdrop. I mean, whose day isn’t going to be better after watching a pink and purple rosy maple moth flying in super slow motion? This is a polyphemus moth, a gigantic species of silk moth. What you are seeing, like all the rest of the clips in this video, was filmed at 6,000 frames per second.


Most of the moths in the video are delightfully fuzzy and chonky — if these moths were birds, they’d be birbs. Shall we call them mopfs?

                    <span>The three-point shot has become the focus of the offensive strategy of every successful NBA team. But is it also making the game boring?
The math states that scoring one-third of your shots from behind the 3-point line is as good as scoring half your shots from inside the line. In other words: Shooting as many 3s as possible will likely lead to a higher score.
The league took notice, and teams and players followed suit. 3s have become so prevalent in recent years that fans are criticizing the league for being oversaturated with them. Critics worry that the game is on the verge of becoming boring because everyone is trying to do the same thing. And that’s led some to wonder if the NBA should move the 3-point line back.


Check out the “additional reading” in the YouTube description, like The NBA is at a breaking point with three-point shooting and Is It Time to Move the NBA 3-Point Line Back? (2014).

                    <span>Back in October of 2020, Apple introduced a service program to address AirPods Pro issues that could cause them to experience static, crackling sounds, or problems with Active Noise Cancellation. At the time, Apple said the program would cover the ‌AirPods Pro‌ for two years after the retail sale of the unit.





Apple has now extended the program, quietly updating the accompanying support document back at the beginning of October. As noted on Reddit, the &quot;Additional Information&quot; section of the page now notes that the program will cover affected ‌AirPods Pro‌ for three years after the first retail sale of the unit, up from the initial two years.



Customers who purchased AirPods at launch in 2019 will now be covered until October 2022 should this issue pop up, and those who bought in 2020 before the repaired version in October 2020 came out can get repairs until 2023.



Faulty ‌AirPods Pro‌ that are in need of repair exhibit the following problems:



 	
Crackling or static sounds that increase in loud environments, with exercise or while talking on the phone


 	
Active Noise Cancellation not working as expected, such as a loss of bass sound, or an increase in background sounds, such as street or airplane noise




Affected ‌AirPods‌ were manufactured before October 2020, and those who have ‌AirPods Pro‌ experiencing issues can bring them to Apple or an Apple Authorized Service Provider for service free of charge. Apple says that the ‌‌AirPods Pro‌‌ will be examined prior to service to verify that they&#x27;re eligible for the program. ‌‌AirPods Pro‌‌ earbuds demonstrating the issue (left, right, or both) will be replaced.



The program applies only to the ‌AirPods Pro‌ and not the ‌AirPods‌ or the AirPods Max.

                    <span>Astropad today announced the launch of new software for the Luna Display, with the 5.0 update introducing support for Windows PCs.





The Luna Display is a little dongle that&#x27;s designed to allow an iPad or a Mac to be used as a secondary display for a main Mac machine. It&#x27;s similar to Sidecar, but works with both Macs and iPads.



Luna Display users who own a USB-C version of the dongle can upgrade to the new software to use the device interchangeably between Macs and PCs. That means Mac users who have a Luna Display can also now use it with PCs, connecting a secondary ‌iPad‌ to a PC to serve as an extra display.



The Luna Display apps have been rearchitected to support both PCs and Macs, and the update also introduces a faster setup flow for M1 Macs. The Luna Display can be purchased from the Astropad website.

For those unfamiliar with Speck, the company makes a wide range of high-quality cases and accessories for Apple devices.





Speck has several MagSafe-compatible cases designed for Apple&#x27;s ‌iPhone 13‌ models, including the Presidio Perfect-Clear, the Presidio2 Grip, and Presidio2 Pro, all of which are slim, protective, and attractive.

                    <span>Universal Control, one of the main new features that Apple highlighted for macOS Monterey back in June, has yet to be implemented even in the tenth beta and it is still unclear if it will be available when the software launches.





Though not yet implemented, Universal Control settings can be force enabled with a feature flag, and it is clear that Apple is working on it behind the scenes. In the latest beta update released this morning, Universal Control settings that have been manually enabled have a &quot;Beta&quot; label.



The &quot;Beta&quot; labeling suggests that Apple could be planning to make the feature available to users when ‌macOS Monterey‌ launches, even if all the bugs have not been worked out. Apple did something similar for the iCloud+ Private Relay feature, which is also available in a beta capacity at the current time.



Universal Control, which is an iPadOS 15 and Monterey feature, is designed to allow multiple Macs and iPads to be operated the same time using the same input devices, so Mac and iPad owners can use a single mouse and keyboard across more than one Mac, more than one ‌iPad‌, or a mix of Macs and iPads.

                    <span>Apple is continuing to refine the unpopular Safari design that it introduced in macOS Monterey, and the latest beta tweaks the position of the Favorites bar.





The design initially had Favorites located below the tab bar, a departure from the location in prior versions of macOS, including macOS Big Sur. With the tenth beta, Apple has relocated Favorites and put it back above the Tab bar where it was originally.



Apple has been changing the design of Safari throughout the beta testing process, but for many, the new look continues to be inferior to the previous Safari interface, especially when it comes to the tab bar design.




So some Safari on macOS Monterey news... they moved the Favorites Bar back up where it belongs. Apple really is still tweaking Mac Safari...https://t.co/QavSZnsQe5 pic.twitter.com/n3qpQuD2nD
— Jason Snell (@jsnell) October 13, 2021
 


Apple has also released Safari 15 with the Monterey-style design to ‌macOS Big Sur‌ users, and the same Favorites change may be coming in an update set to be released in the near future.



‌macOS Monterey‌ is likely nearing a release as we are expecting it to come out right around when new MacBook Pro models launch. Apple is holding an event on Monday, October 18 to introduce the new machines, so we may not have too long to wait until the update launches.



Update: As noted by Daring Fireball&#x27;s John Gruber, iOS 15.1 beta 4 also includes the same Safari design tweak with the Favorites bar located above the tabs.

                    <span>Jason Segel is set to star in upcoming Apple TV+ series &quot;Shrinking,&quot; Apple announced today. Segel is writing and executive producing the show alongside &quot;Ted Lasso&quot; co-creator Bill Lawrence and &quot;Ted Lasso&quot; star and writer Brett Goldstein, who plays Roy Kent on the series.





The 10-episode comedy series will feature Segel playing a therapist who begins to break the rules and tells his clients what he really thinks of them. &quot;Ignoring his training and ethics, he finds himself making huge, tumultuous changes to people&#x27;s lives ... including his own,&quot; reads the show&#x27;s description.



Segel is starring in upcoming ‌Apple TV+‌ movie &quot;The Sky is Everywhere,&quot; based on the best-selling young adult novel of the same name, so this is his second ‌Apple TV+‌ project. He&#x27;s also somewhat famous at MacRumors as he is a fan and mentioned the site in the DVD commentary for &quot;Forgetting Sarah Marshall.&quot; &quot;I love MacRumors.com,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#x27;s tomorrow&#x27;s Mac news today.&quot;



&quot;Shrinking&quot; is a promising upcoming TV+ series as it is coming from some of the team behind &quot;Ted Lasso.&quot; &quot;Ted Lasso&quot; has thus far won multiple awards, and it is one of the headline shows on ‌Apple TV+‌. There is no word yet on when &quot;Shrinking&quot; will debut.

To install ‌‌‌watchOS 8.1‌‌‌, developers will need to download the configuration profile from the Apple Developer Center. Once installed, ‌‌‌watchOS 8‌‌‌ can be downloaded through the dedicated Apple Watch app on the iPhone by going to General &gt; Software update.



To update to new software, an Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery life, it must be placed on the charger, and it needs to be in range of the ‌‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌‌.



We don&#x27;t yet know what&#x27;s new in watchOS 8.1 and there were no new features found in the first three betas, but we&#x27;ll update this article should anything new pop up in the fourth beta.

Developers can download the new tvOS 15.1 beta by downloading a profile onto the ‌Apple TV‌ using Xcode.



Other than new releases, tvOS updates are often minor in scale, focusing on under-the-hood bug fixes and improvements rather than major outward-facing changes. We don&#x27;t yet know what&#x27;s included in tvOS 15.1, but we&#x27;ll update this article should anything be found.



Though we don&#x27;t often know what&#x27;s new in tvOS during the beta testing process, we let MacRumors readers know when new updates are available so those who are developers can download it upon release.

                    <span>CCP Games today announced that popular MMORPG Eve Online is now available to play on both Intel and M1 Macs thanks to the launch of a new Mac client.






For those unfamiliar with Eve Online, it&#x27;s a long-running free-to-play online space-focused game that&#x27;s massive in scale. It has been free for many years now and monetized through in-app purchases. Mac users will be able to play alongside Windows gamers as Eve Online features one big universe.



Prior to now Eve Online was only available to play on Macs through a compatibility layer like Wine, so gameplay will be faster, more efficient, and hassle-free. The game features improved graphics and visual effects on Mac, along with reduced RAM and power usage. There&#x27;s also full support for Mac keyboards and mice.



A Mac client has been in testing for some time, and CCP says that user feedback on the test server offered vital assistance as it worked to implement Mac compatibility. Those who install the latest launcher version will be able to migrate from the prior Wine client to the Mac client automatically.

                    <span>Last month, FCC filings revealed that Apple Watch Series 7 models are equipped with a new module that enables 60.5GHz wireless data transfer. This module is not advertised on Apple&#x27;s website and is likely for Apple&#x27;s internal use only.




The hidden diagnostic port on an Apple Watch Series 3


MacRumors has since confirmed with The Verge&#x27;s Dieter Bohn and others that the Apple Watch Series 7 lacks a hidden diagnostic port that was located in the bottom band slot on all previous Apple Watch models. Apple used the port for diagnostic purposes when servicing an Apple Watch, such as to restore watchOS over a wired connection with a special tool.



The lack of a diagnostic port on Apple Watch Series 7 models likely explains the addition of the 60.5GHz wireless data transfer module. FCC filings indicated that the module is only activated when the Apple Watch is placed on a proprietary magnetic dock with a corresponding 60.5GHz module, so it sounds like Apple might use this dock to perform diagnostics or restore watchOS wirelessly on Series 7 models.



It&#x27;s also worth noting that Series 7 models feature IP6X-rated dust resistance, so perhaps the diagnostic port&#x27;s removal helped with that to some degree.



Apple Watch Series 7 models will begin arriving to customers and launch in stores this Friday, October 15. Key features include larger displays with 41mm and 45mm case sizes, enhanced durability with IP6X-rated dust resistance, up to 33% faster charging with an included USB-C fast charging cable, and new aluminum colors.

                    <span>Today we&#x27;re tracking a pair of deals on two Apple products: the Apple Pencil 2 and M1 Mac mini from 2020. For the latter product, Amazon is offering a return of all-time low prices for both the 256GB and 512GB storage options.

Apple Pencil 2


Amazon has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This is the second-best price that we&#x27;ve ever tracked on the accessory, but it&#x27;s been about two months since we last saw the Apple Pencil down to under $100, so Amazon&#x27;s deal today is a solid buy for those in the market for the device.

                    <span>Apple&#x27;s suppliers have refuted a report suggesting that due to the ongoing chip shortage, Apple has cut production orders for iPhone 13 models by as much as 10 million units for 2021.





Yesterday, Bloomberg reported that due to the chip shortage, Apple had informed suppliers about cutting ‌iPhone 13‌ production by as much as 10 million units for the remainder of the year. The news caused a drop in Apple&#x27;s stock, leading some analysts to be concerned about the performance of the ‌iPhone 13‌ and Apple&#x27;s ability to keep up with demand. Now, however, the company&#x27;s suppliers are pushing back. 



A preview of a paywalled DigiTimes report set to be published tomorrow states, &quot;component suppliers for Apple&#x27;s new iPhones have claimed no cutback in orders thus far this year.&quot; While the news about a cutback in orders may be incorrect, according to suppliers, there is little doubt regarding production challenges for Apple&#x27;s products. 



The iPhone 13 Pro and ‌‌iPhone 13 Pro‌‌ Max, for example, continue to list weeks or even as long as a month for delivery dates. The Apple Watch Series 7, going on sale this Friday, is also experiencing delays in shipments, with some high-end models leading into early December. A report last week said that Apple&#x27;s suppliers are &quot;scrambling&quot; to keep up with production due to new energy regulations in China impacting efficiency.

                    <span>In response to the European Commission&#x27;s proposed Digital Markets Act, which could force sideloading of apps on the iPhone in Europe, Apple has shared an in-depth document highlighting the security and privacy risks of sideloading. Sideloading refers to installing apps outside of the App Store, such as from a website or a third-party app store.





Apple&#x27;s document, titled Building a Trusted Ecosystem for Millions of Apps, states that &quot;mobile malware and the resulting security and privacy threats are increasingly common and predominantly present on platforms that allow sideloading.&quot; For example, Apple cited Nokia&#x27;s 2019 and 2020 Threat Intelligence Reports that found Android devices to have an &quot;estimated 15 to 47 times more infections from malicious software&quot; than iPhones.

                    <span>Apple&#x27;s TV+ digital streaming service is expected to have a total of 36 million subscribers by the end of 2026, according to research firm Digital TV Research (via The Hollywood Reporter).





According to the research, Disney&#x27;s wildly successful streaming service will overtake Netflix and reach 284.2 million subscribers by 2026. Netflix by comparison is expected to hit 270.7 million subscribers by that time. Amazon Prime Video is expected to grow to 243.4 million users.

                    <span>Apple is developing AirPods with health features, including body temperature and posture monitoring, and the ability to work as a hearing aid, according to The Wall Street Journal.





According to documents seen by The Wall Street Journal, prototypes of ‌AirPods‌ with temperature sensors for monitoring a wearer&#x27;s core body temperature from inside the ear are being developed. The report noted that these in-ear temperature sensors could work in tandem with a temperature sensor in the Apple Watch Series 8.



The health-focused ‌AirPods‌ reportedly also use motion sensors to monitor a wearer&#x27;s posture and alert them when they are slouching in an effort to improve posture.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(8 min)</span>
                    <span>On the Apple TV, if you prefer not to input text using the Siri Remote you can use a nearby iPhone or iPad to type. Whenever a text field appears on the ‌Apple TV‌, a notification appears on the ‌iPhone‌ or ‌iPad‌, and after tapping the notification, you can use the on-screen keyboard on your iOS device to enter text on the ‌Apple TV‌.





It used to be the case that you could disable these notifications if you started to find them annoying (and if you have several Apple TVs in the house with kids using them or multiple paired iOS devices, you&#x27;ll know what we mean), but despite advertising this option in its tvOS 15 User Guide, Apple for some reason removed this ability in iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, which quickly prompted many user complaints.



The good news is that in the latest iOS 15.1 and iPadOS 15.1 developer and public betas, Apple has reinstated the ability to turn off ‌Apple TV‌ keyboard notifications. If you&#x27;re running the beta on your device, or just for future reference when iOS/iPadOS 15.1 is officially released, here&#x27;s how to disable them.


Launch Settings on your ‌iPhone‌ or ‌iPad‌.


Tap Notifications.


Under &quot;Notification Style,&quot; select Apple TV Keyboard.


Toggle off the switch next to Allow Notifications.




If you&#x27;re running iOS 15.1 and you don&#x27;t see the ‌Apple TV‌ Keyboard listed in the Notifications menu, you may need to connect to your ‌Apple TV‌ and select a text field to activate a keyboard input notification, before it will show up there.

International Business Machines Corp. said it will follow President Joe Biden’s mandate requiring that employees be vaccinated against Covid-19, overriding an order from the Texas governor Monday blocking such actions.
“IBM is a federal contractor and must comply with federal requirements, which direct employees of federal contractors to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 by December 8th or obtain a medical or religious accommodation,” a spokesperson for the New York-based company said. “We will continue to protect the health and safety of IBM employees and clients, and we will continue to follow federal requirements.”

                    <span>Wonderful profile of Milwaukee Brewers legend Bob Uecker — 87 and going strong in the broadcast booth — by Adam McCalvy for MLB.com:
It’s been like this in Milwaukee forever. When Uecker joined the
Brewers’ radio team in 1971, he was only four years removed from
playing the final season of a Major League career that spanned the
Milwaukee Braves, the Phillies and then the Atlanta Braves.
Then-Brewers owner Bud Selig originally hired Uecker as a scout,
but it was a failed enterprise. Selig swears that he once received
a scouting report in the mail from Uecker that was smeared with
mashed potatoes and gravy.

                    <span>Speaking of forthcoming AR/VR headsets, Evan “Evleaks” Blass has leaked a slew of marketing images for the apparently imminent HTC Vive Flow. Looks cool, in a Nite Owl sort of way. The future’s going to be weird if these things go mainstream, though.
Update: Does seem kind of suboptimal, to say the least, that it has a fan.

                    <span>Kim Lyons, reporting for The Verge:
Magic Leap has raised $500 million in funding and is preparing to
release a new AR headset, the Magic Leap 2, next year, the company
announced Monday. The headset will be generally available
next year, the company said, and “select customers” are using it
as part of an early access program.
CEO Peggy Johnson said in a statement that with the new funding
“Magic Leap will have greater financial flexibility and the
resources needed to continue our growth trajectory as we expand on
our industry-leading AR technology.” She revealed the new device
in an Monday appearance on CNBC.
I can’t believe this company still exists, let alone is convincing investors to give them more money.

                    <span>While Wake County’s two largest municipalities, Raleigh and Cary, delayed their elections until November of next year due to late census data, the 10 other towns in Wake—Apex, Fuquay-Varina, Garner, Holly Springs, Knightdale, Morrisville, Rolesville, Wake Forest, Wendell, and Zebulon—are all holding elections this fall. All of these towns are electing members to their town councils or boards of commissioners. Some are also electing mayors. A handful have bond referendum questions on the ballot, too.

With the dawn of a new year of hockey upon us, it’s time to look to the future.
 After a strenuous season rife with disappointment, momentous changes have finally arrived in the City of Brotherly Love. The Philadelphia Flyers enter this season with almost half of their starting lineup composed of new players or more established roster pieces looking to bounce back from declined production in 2020-21. This fact makes it difficult to project where the Orange &amp; Black will land within the unforgiving hellscape that is the Metropolitan Division, but that won’t stop us here at BSH from trying.

Consider stretchy pants on game day this season. 
 For many a hardcore Flyers fan, heading to the arena to watch a game is something of a ritual. From the jersey you wear, to the route you take to the arena, to the entrance to The Farg you use, to the snacks and bevs you grab on your way to your seat, you’ve probably done nearly the same thing every time you’ve treated yourself to a Flyers game. We’re creatures of habit, we hockey fans.

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *If you think about it, the home opener is practically tomorrow. Like, today is almost over, and Friday is the day, so that’s like one day. Excited yet?! Maybe Ryan Ellis will play, that’ll be good, right? [NBC Sports Philly]
*Its fair to ask why the Flyers elected to go with this guy they just claimed off of waivers rather than a player they already had in-house. And they answer is apparently, “because the numbers told them to.” [Inquirer]
*Charlie looks at that choice as well as other Roster Things that you might be wondering about. [The Athletic]
*If you’re thinking of placing any bets on the Flyers this year, the odds are... in your favor? You’ll win lots of money if they hit, is what I’m saying. [BSH]
*Yet another Metropolitan Division preview has made one thing pretty clear: no one is expecting much out of the Washington Capitals this season. [The Athletic]
*Friedman’s latest 30+ Thoughts include a few about your Flyers. [Sportsnet]
*Dave Hakstol’s season kicked off last night and he’s hoping this season will be something of a rebound year for him. [ProHockeyTalk]
*Nathan MacKinnon has Covid, and while he seems to be fine... yikes for the Avs. [Mile High Hockey]
*Hopefully we have some brand new Flyers fans joining us this season and, with a whole new fanbase in the league, it might be good to go over some of the weirder NHL rules. Like overtime rules. [NBC Sports Philly]
*There’s also all of this weird lingo that, if you’ve been around a while, you just take for granted. But new fans should know what wheels are, too. [Davy Jones’ Locker Room]
*And finally, BSH Radio has moved to Mondays for the season, which means you’ve got a brand new episode to enjoy! [BSH]</span>

It will launch on streaming service Binge
 The games-centric entertainment streaming platform Binge has added a live-action System Shock series to its programming docket, according to Deadline. 
Retro games publisher Nightdive Studios currently owns the rights to System Shock, and the live-action project will be executive produced by Nightdive executives Stephen Kick and Larry Kuperman. Binge’s Chief Content Officer, Allan Ungar, will be producer on the project.
“I’ve always believed that a live action adaptation of System Shock would be the perfect medium to retell the harrowing story of Citadel station and its rogue AI that subjects the crew to unimaginable horror,” Kick told Deadline. “We’re very excited to see the talented team at Binge bring System Shock to life in horrifyingly real and new ways.”
Originally released in 1994, System Shock follows a security hacker on space station Citadel, who must fight against a rogue artificial intelligence named SHODAN. Developed by LookingGlass Technologies and published by Origin Systems, the first-person game is set in a cyberpunk-tinged version of 2072. System Shock was highly influential, with the Bioshock games regarded as successors. (Fun fact: Gone Home supposedly also exists in the same universe as Bioshock and System Shock).
The System Shock adaptation will be one of several properties in Binge’s games-leaning original content slate — this, so far, includes a TV adaptation of Ubisoft’s Driver, which is the early aughts, comparatively lower-key competitor to Grand Theft Auto. Binge will launch in 2022.</span>

Saudi Arabia’s Jeddah Circuit will be added in November
 F1 2021 on Wednesday added the second of three free race courses coming post-launch to Codemasters’ motorsports sim. Imola — official name Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari — is now available in all modes of play.
Imola hosted the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix on April 18, the second round of this year’s Formula 1 World Championship. It and Portugal’s Portimão Circuit were last-minute additions to F1’s COVID-altered 2020 and 2021 schedules, forcing Codemasters to hustle up efforts to build and add them to the game, along with Saudi Arab…</span>

Ubisoft did not provide a reason for the delay
 Ubisoft has delayed the first test of its latest Ghost Recon game. Just a few weeks after its reveal, the closed technical test for Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Frontline has been delayed indefinitely, Ubisoft announced on Wednesday. 
Ubisoft’s announcement of the delay was extremely vague, offering no reason other than that a delay was the best choice and that the “development team is dedicated to creating the best experience possible.” 
That said, the decision doesn’t come as much of a surprise given fans’ negative response to the game’s announcement. Ghost Recon Frontline is a 100-player, free-to-play shooter that takes inspiration from the battle royale genre. In other words, the game is a far cry from the slow-paced, tactical, squad-based action that the Ghost Recon series is known for. 
On the Ghost Recon subreddit and in YouTube comment sections, fans expressed their disappointment at the direction Ubisoft was taking with the series. Despite fans’ dissatisfaction, there’s still no indication from Ubisoft as to whether or not the the game will change directions. Polygon has reached out to Ubisoft for further details.
For now, the future of Ghost Recon Frontline remains uncertain. According to Ubisoft’s announcement, the developer will share the new date for the closed test when it has one.</span>

Activision tells players its Ricochet Anti-Cheat system is not always-on
 Call of Duty: Warzone will get a kernel-level anti-cheat system in an update scheduled for next month, a significant escalation in developers’ efforts to root out and remove cheaters from a free-to-play battle royale that claims more than 100 million users.
As if acknowledging the severity of this development, a news release from Activision on Wednesday included several statements and reassurances about player privacy and what the Ricochet Anti-Cheat system will do on their computers. Ricochet will only be operating when players are in Call of Duty: Warzone on their PC, Activision said, and the software is not an “always-on” monitor. “The kernel-level driver only monitors and repor…</span>

Developers from Grounded, Sea of Thieves, and Minecraft Dungeons share their notes
 One may be the loneliest number, but four can sometimes feel just as limited. There’s just something about that magic number of four players that has become the standard for multiplayer games. And there are tons of great games and upcoming titles — Sea of Thieves, Back 4 Blood, Vermintide 2, Redfall, No Man’s Sky, the Borderlands series, Deep Rock Galactic, most of Grand Theft Auto Online, Grounded, The Anacrusis, Phasmophobia — that make you pick three other friends and buckle up. 
Larger groups have to find workarounds or another game altogether. This can get awkward — I’ve had several evenings where three friends and I are in Discord, having a great time, and then a…</span>

The seminal tabletop experience gets a remarkable port
 Gloomhaven is no longer just a popular board game. It’s a franchise. Designed and published by Isaac Childres, this cooperative dungeon crawler attained massive success across three separate Kickstarters, including the $13 million sequel Frosthaven. Now, after several years in early access, the full digital game is ready for its final release on PC. The end result is marvelous.  
As a tabletop game, Gloomhaven is novel for several reasons. The first is a rich, diceless combat system. Players select from several classes, each possessing a discrete deck of action cards. These include the typical options of moving around the dungeon and attacking a foe, but also special abilities such as the Cragheart’s t…</span>

Some jobs have a lot of actions on their hotbars
 As Final Fantasy 14 Online grows through more expansions and updates, the job and class system becomes more crowded. With each expansion comes a level cap increase, and with that comes new skills and passive abilities, which means more buttons to press. The upcoming Endwalker expansion, due out this November, is no exception.
After getting a chance to play a special build of Endwalker, we were able to talk about these problems with the game’s producer, Naoki Yoshida, in a short Q&amp;A session. Fresh from the playtest, we had questions about skill changes that we noticed.
Notably, some jobs are really pushing the limits with the number of action buttons on the hotbars. When switching to Astrologian for th…</span>

                    <span>In 1927, photographer and ethnologist Edward S. Curtis travelled to the US territory of Alaska to photograph indigenous peoples and their cultures for his seminal work, The North American Indian. Some of the photos he took in Alaska were never published and make up a new exhibition at the Muskegon Museum of Art, Edward S. Curtis: Unpublished Alaska, The Lost Photographs.
Begun in 1906, The North American Indian was the defining passion of Curtis’s life, an attempt to record, in writing and photography, the lives of the Indigenous peoples of the Southwestern, Western, and Northwestern United States. This trip, planned for a single season, would be the final voyage to complete his epic quest. Curtis took hundreds of images on his journey, only part of which were ultimately published.

                    <span>In the United States and in many other countries around the world, we’re slowly shifting away from the Covid-19 pandemic to SARS-CoV-2 being endemic (like the flu), Dr. Lucy McBride argues that we need to recalibrate our risk calculations and expectations of what’s safe &amp; dangerous. From A COVID Serenity Prayer in The Atlantic:
For the past 18 months, my patients have craved straightforward answers: a simple “Yes-it’s perfectly safe” or “Go for it. Have fun!” or even a “No, you absolutely cannot” to quiet the endless loops of risk calculations. But medicine is not about certainty. It never has been.
The two things that patients want-reassurance that they won’t get COVID-19 and permission to engage in life-I cannot deliver, and I never will be able to. SARS-CoV-2 is here to stay. The virus will be woven into our everyday existence much like RSV, influenza, and other common coronaviruses are. The question isn’t whether we’ll be exposed to the novel coronavirus; it’s when.
And although many of us will inevitably get COVID-19, for the majority of vaccinated people, it won’t be so bad. The vaccines weren’t designed to wholly prevent COVID-19; they transformed it into a manageable illness like the flu.
That means that, from a decision-making perspective, we’re starting to reach the acceptance phase of the pandemic: a time when we must recalibrate our individual risk gauges, which have been completely thrown out of whack. The approach I’m embracing with patients boils down to a secular version of the serenity prayer. We need “the serenity to accept the things [we] cannot change, courage to change the things [we] can, and the wisdom to know the difference.”

                    <span>Ongoing chip shortages faced by the tech industry are affecting production of the iPhone 13 models, according to a new report from Bloomberg.





Apple is expected to cut 2021 ‌iPhone 13‌ production by as many as 10 million units because of the shortages.



In the final three months of the year, Apple was planning to produce 90 million ‌iPhone 13‌ models, but Apple&#x27;s manufacturing partners have been informed that the totals will be lower because Broadcom and Texas Instruments are not able to deliver enough components.



Apple&#x27;s ‌iPhone 13‌ supplies are already constrained, and further shortages during the holiday period will push delivery times even further going forward.



According to an iFixit teardown, the ‌iPhone 13‌ models are using a Broadcom AFEM-8215 front-en…</span>

                    <span>Apple today announced it will be holding a virtual event on Monday, October 18 at 10 a.m. Pacific Time, and rumors widely suggest that redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models will be unveiled with a faster version of the M1 chip.





After the event was announced, a few readers asked us when to expect orders to begin for the new MacBook Pro models, should they be announced.



While nothing is for certain until Apple says so, almost all new Macs announced at an Apple Event over the last five years were made available to order on the same day of the event. The only exception was the 24-inch iMac earlier this year.

                    <span>With the MacBook-centric Apple event now set for Monday, October 18, leakers are beginning to share a few new details that we haven&#x27;t previously heard about the machines.





According to Dylandkt, the base 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro models will feature 16GB RAM and 512GB of storage space, which is in line with the current high-end 13 and 16-inch MacBook Pro options.



As he has said previously, the new MacBook Pro models are also expected to feature an upgraded 1080p webcam, and the M1X chip will have the same configuration in both sizes with 10-core CPU.



Dylandkt claims Apple will provide a new charging brick, which is not a surprise since the upcoming machines are rumored to feature a new MagSafe charging port, which would necessitate new charging hardware.

The updated hashflag features a light blue to darker blue transition, which is in line with the artwork for the event invite. Apple uses hashflags to increase event visibility and build hype on social media networks.



Apple has been using custom Twitter hashflags since late last year, and research done by Agency Creative suggests that these custom hashflags can cost up to $1 million.

                    <span>Next year&#x27;s Apple Watch, which would be the Series 8, could come in three sizes, according to display analyst Ross Young. On Twitter, Young said that people should not be surprised &quot;if there are three sizes next year.&quot;





Young did not provide details on what those three sizes might be, but he asked if users would like to see a &quot;bigger display,&quot; so presumably the third size would be a larger Apple Watch than is currently offered.



Apple in 2021 made minor changes to the design of the Apple Watch Series 7, and it comes in 41mm and 45mm case options. Prior Apple Watch models have been available in 38mm, 40mm, 42mm, and 44mm sizes, with increases coming alongside slimmed down bezels and larger display sizes.



This is the first we&#x27;ve heard of the possibility of the Apple Watch Series 8 being available in more than two sizes, and it is not clear what kind of size increase Apple might offer.



Though we&#x27;re still waiting on the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌, we have heard rumors about what might be coming in 2022. The Apple Watch Series 8 could be available in an option with a &quot;rugged casing&quot; aimed at athletes, hikers, and others who use the watch in more extreme conditions than day to day wear, plus it could have a temperature sensor. Other health sensors that have been in the works for some time are also possibilities, such as blood glucose monitoring for diabetics.

                    <span>One of Apple&#x27;s self-driving test vehicles was involved in a minor incident on September 27, according to a filing made with the California DMV [PDF].





The self-driving vehicle, which was operating in autonomous mode at the time, clipped a curb while going 13 miles per hour. There was no damage reported, but the car did require a realignment.
A test vehicle, operating in autonomous mode in Sunnyvale and turning right from Mathilda Avenue onto Del Ray Avenue, made contact with a curb at approximately 13 miles per hour. While there was no tire or wheel damage, the contact resulted in misalignment. No other agents were involved, no injuries were reported, and law enforcement was not called to the scene.
The incident occurred when the vehicle was turning right from Mathilda Avenue onto Del Ray Avenue, a location that is right near Apple&#x27;s Mathilda Avenue location.



Apple&#x27;s self-driving vehicles have been involved in several very minor accidents, but most have been caused by other drivers and while not in autonomous mode. This is the second event that has occurred where an Apple vehicle was being operated in autonomous mode.



Apple has been testing its self-driving software since early 2017, using the aforementioned Lexus RX 450h vehicles outfitted with sensors and cameras in the area around its Cupertino campuses. The work on autonomous driving is part of Apple&#x27;s longtime car project, and rumors suggest Apple is planning to release a vehicle in the mid to late 2020s.

We&#x27;ve been hearing endless exciting rumors about the new machines, but this morning, display analyst Ross Young shared something new - the upcoming MacBook Pro models could feature a 120Hz refresh rate.



In a Twitter conversation, Young said that the 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro models will feature mini-LED displays with 120Hz refresh rates. We&#x27;ve heard about the possibility of a mini-LED display prior to now, but Young says that it is &quot;100% confirmed.&quot;




Yes, new 14&quot; and 16&quot; MacBook Pro&#x27;s will have miniLEDs and we believe they will also be 120Hz refresh.

                    <span>Apple just announced its second fall event, which is set to take place on Monday, October 18. As usual, the Apple Events webpage features an augmented reality logo that you can see when viewing the page on an iOS device.





Open up the Apple Events page on an iPhone or an iPad and then tap on the logo to open the augmented reality interface. Apple asks you to scan around the room and then projects the graphic from the event invite into the area.



For the Unleashed event, the augmented reality view features beams of blue light that are arranged in the shape of an Apple logo, along with the date &quot;10.18.&quot;



Apple&#x27;s October event is expected to focus on new MacBook Pro models, but we could also see the AirPods 3 and a refreshed version of the Mac mini. Apple plans to livestream the event, but MacRumors will also have live coverage both here on MacRumors.com and on our MacRumorsLive Twitter account.

                    <span>Over a decade after being released on the App Store, the classic hit iPhone game Tiny Wings is coming to Apple Arcade this Friday.





Tiny Wings is a casual game that involves tapping and holding the screen to control a bird whose wings are too tiny to fly. The game tasks players with outrunning the sun as they fly a bird across procedurally generated islands. Players must tap on the screen at the perfect moment so that the bird slides down hills and gains enough momentum to reach the next island before the sun sets, while aiming to complete tricks for score multipliers.



Tiny Wings, created by Andreas Illiger, was first released on the App Store in 2011 and remains one of the most popular paid games in the casual category. On Apple Arcade, the game will be titled Tiny Wings+ and it will be available for the iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV. Like all Apple Arcade titles, the game does not have any in-app purchases or ads.



Other games coming to Apple Arcade include NBA 2K22 Arcade Edition on October 19 and Kingdom Rush Frontiers, which doesn&#x27;t have a release date yet.



Priced at $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year, Apple Arcade is a subscription-based service that provides access to a catalog of over 200 games across the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV, with additional titles added periodically.

                    <span>Adobe today announced that Adobe Camera RAW support is coming to Photoshop on the iPad, which will allow Photoshop ‌iPad‌ users to import, open, and edit RAW files. The upcoming feature was highlighted in a demo video that Adobe shared on YouTube, but no details on when it will launch were provided.






According to Adobe, RAW support will work with file types ranging from DNG to Apple ProRAW, which is the RAW file format available on the iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro models. 



RAW files can be edited like any other image, with users able to adjust aspects like exposure and noise and use Photoshop&#x27;s non-destructive editing and auto-adjustment tools. 



Photoshop for iPad is part of Adobe&#x27;s Creative Cloud plan. Access is available priced starting at $9.99 per month for the Photography plan.

                    <span>As the popularity of Apple TV+ grows, Apple appears to be struggling to contend with increasing levels of online piracy, despite concerted efforts to take down its stolen content, MacRumors has found.





Piracy is a lucrative business for torrent sites, with a report from August estimating that the top five piracy websites raise around $18.3 million in ad revenue and sponsorships per year. According to the Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment (ACE), streaming piracy represents up to 80 percent of piracy, costing companies as much as $71 billion annually.



Although Google has increasingly cracked down on websites that host pirated content, site operators often change domains and redirect users to avoid takedowns and keep torrent links accessible. In a research paper publi…</span>

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(8 min)</span>
                    <span>Hyper today announced the release of two new HyperDrive hubs that allow M1 models of the MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro to connect to two 4K displays over HDMI in a plug-and-play manner with no drivers required.





There is a 3-in-1 version of the hub with two HDMI ports and a USB-C Power Delivery port for up to 100W of pass-through charging, and a 10-in-1 version of the hub that offers those same ports with the addition of another USB-C port, two USB-A ports, a Gigabit Ethernet port, microSD and SD card slots, and a 3.5mm headphone jack.



Hyper says both hubs deliver dual 4K HDMI video output over a single USB-C connection to M1 MacBook models by using a combination of both DisplayPort Alt Mode and SiliconMotion InstantView plug-and-play video technology. After connecting the hub to the Mac, users must open the HyperDisplay app that appears on the desktop.



Keep in mind that on both of the hubs, one HDMI port supports 60Hz and the other is limited to 30Hz, which may be a dealbreaker for some users.



The 3-in-1 hub is priced at $129.99 in the United States and is available on Hyper&#x27;s website, while the 10-in-1 hub runs for $199.99.

                    <span>Infiniti today announced that most of its 2020 and newer vehicles are now eligible for a complimentary upgrade to wireless CarPlay in the United States.





The free software update is available for 2020 and 2021 models of the Q50, Q60, QX50, and QX80 from now until March 31, 2022, according to Infiniti. Owners of these vehicles can schedule an appointment at an Infiniti dealership to have the update completed.



Infiniti is also offering wireless CarPlay in 2022 models of the Q50, Q60, QX55, QX60, and QX80.



Infiniti, the luxury brand of Japanese automaker Nissan, was a late adopter of CarPlay. MacRumors editor-in-chief Eric Slivka reviewed wired CarPlay in the 2020 QX50 last year and the vehicle is now eligible for the complimentary wireless CarPlay upgrade.



Wireless CarPlay works over Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, allowing for an iPhone to be connected to the infotainment system without a Lightning cable. Infiniti joins a long list of automakers that have started adopting wireless CarPlay, including Hyundai, Honda, Acura, Ford, GM, Chrysler, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Volkswagen, and others.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/12/ecobee-smartthermostat-hey-siri-update/">

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(8 min)</span>
                    <span>Ecobee today announced that its HomeKit-enabled SmartThermostat with voice control is gaining &quot;Hey Siri&quot; support with a free software update that is beginning to roll out now and will be available over the next few weeks for all users.





&quot;Hey Siri&quot; support allows users with a HomePod or HomePod mini to control the SmartThermostat with voice commands for tasks such as setting the temperature and sending Intercom messages. The thermostat relays the requests through a HomePod or HomePod mini connected to the same Wi-Fi network to ensure privacy and security. Users can also continue to control the thermostat in the Home app on an iPhone, iPad, or Mac.



Apple announced at WWDC 2021 that HomeKit accessory makers would be able to integrate ‌Siri‌ voice control for the first time, allowing the accessories to support ‌Siri‌ features such as Personal Requests, Intercom messages, timers, and alarms. As mentioned, Hey ‌Siri‌-enabled accessories are required to relay requests through a ‌HomePod‌ or ‌HomePod mini‌.



In addition to a HomePod or HomePod mini, users need a device with iOS 15 or iPadOS 15 or later to use Siri voice control on the SmartThermostat.



Ecobee&#x27;s SmartThermostat with voice control is regularly priced at $249.99 in the United States and is available to purchase on Ecobee.com and through select partners, including Amazon, Lowe&#x27;s, Home Depot, Best Buy, or an Ecobee certified installer.

                    <span>Today we&#x27;re tracking a new Amazon low price on the 2021 32GB Apple TV 4K, available for $159.99, down from $179.00. This $19 discount is a match of the same all-time low price we saw last week, and it&#x27;s the first time we&#x27;ve seen the deal on Amazon.



Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.



Importantly, you&#x27;ll only see this sale price once you add the Apple TV 4K to your cart and an automatic coupon worth $9.01 is applied to the order. The Apple TV 4K is available for the usual free Prime shipping options, and it&#x27;s in stock and ready to ship today.




$19 OFF
2021 Apple TV 4K (32GB) for $159.99





You can also get the 64GB Apple TV 4K for $189.98, down from $199.00. We&#x27;ve seen this Apple TV 4K discounted by an additional $10, so this sale is a second-best price. Both of these Apple TVs are sold by Amazon, and they&#x27;re in stock and ready to ship today.



Although the sales on these Apple TV models aren&#x27;t particularly steep, they are the best offers around and worth checking out if you&#x27;re still on the market for the newest Apple TV 4K. You can keep an eye out on Apple TV deals in our Best Apple TV 4K Deals guide.

The report, citing &quot;sources,&quot; claims that an ‌Apple TV‌ with a thinner and flatter design is in the works, eliminating the &quot;horribly outdated and bulky&quot; design of the current generation ‌Apple TV‌. According to the sketchy report, the ‌Apple TV‌ will feature a &quot;plexiglass&quot; top, a design feature that&#x27;s expected to debut in an upcoming Mac mini. The redesign mentioned in the report is reminiscent of the design of the first-generation ‌Apple TV‌.

In typical Ive fashion, the site is highly minimalist in nature, containing no images, links, or contact details – just a brief text described in an accompanying press release as &quot;a concise and finely crafted definition of the LoveFrom collective and its work.&quot;

Meh doesn’t do ad spots. It’s how they keep that shit cheap. So when they do, they’re always asking for it for cheap. But I’ll be damned if they get a full endorsement after nickel-and-diming me. So here you go:
Go to Meh.com if you want, I don’t give a shit.

                    <span>Jason Snell, Six Colors:
It’s official: there will be another Apple media event this
fall, and it’s Monday, Oct. 18 at 10 Pacific.
New MacBook Pro models are likely to be the star of the show.
We’ll have full coverage on Six Colors, as always. Myke Hurley and
I will offer post-event coverage after it’s all said and done,
live on Relay FM.
The event name is “Unleashed”, and the motif is a take on going into warp drive or hyperspace. Greg Joswiak, on Twitter:
Unleashed! These next six days are going to speed by.
You don’t need to be Kreskin to predict that new pro Macs powered by high-performance Apple silicon will be the main attraction. It seems like a surefire bet that we’ll see the new 16- and 14-inch MacBook Pros. I hope we see the new full-size iMacs — 30-inch displays, perhaps? — too. My other hope: MacBook Pros in black or near-black.
The slightly weird thing about the event is that it’s on a Monday — Apple generally holds events on Tuesdays. Looking at my notes, I think the last time Apple held an event on a Monday (excepting WWDC keynotes, which of course are always on Monday mornings) was the original iPhone SE event, which was on Monday, 21 March 2016. They might have held that one a day early because the next day was Apple’s courtroom showdown with the FBI regarding the San Bernardino gun massacre.
Why hold next week’s event on Monday instead of Tuesday? My only spitball: because Google already announced its fall Pixel event for Tuesday.

It’s a landmark move by the Flyers &amp; Comcast-Spectacor as a whole. 
 As we get ready to head back to The Farg this Friday night to open up the Flyers season at home for the first time in what feels like forever, Flyers’ President of Business Operations Valerie Camillo hopes that a new policy governing fan conduct will make the experience more welcoming for the full spectrum of Philadelphia sports fans. 
This wasn’t just some corporate mandate, either. The policy was created in response to concerns raised by arena staff who have had to suffer way more abuse from fans at various events than they should ever have to — particularly as regulations related to the pandemic have been implemented.

Are there any worthwhile bets to make on the Flyers’ finish to their season or players to earn awards?
 The Philadelphia Flyers are heading into one of their most significant seasons in a long time. If everything goes the way they want it to, we’ll potentially see a lengthy stretch of postseason contention, if not, well, everything will be terrible. So why not commit some of your hard-earned dollars to this team and its players? It might just pay off big.
With the increased popularity of betting and some laws opening it up, it makes sense to delve deep into the odds that are specific to our favorite hockey team. So, we went ahead and scoured FanDuel to look at some of the more prominent odds and wanted to share them with you.

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *Happy NHL opening day, Flyers fans! As you all know the Flyers don’t open ‘til Friday, but the league opens today, which means we finally got the Flyers’ full active roster yesterday afternoon. Opening night lineup is set! [Flyers]
*When we all gather down at The Farg on Friday night, we’ll be welcomed with a new set of rules aimed at making the game-watching experience more enjoyable for everyone. [Inquirer]
*You may have noticed a new name on that list — a guy the Flyers picked up from waivers yesterday and plopped right on to the active roster. [BSH]
*Let’s take a look at five questions facing the team heading into Friday’s opener. [NBC Sports Philly]
*Speaking of questions... how’d you feel about the preseason? It’s just the preseason, sure, but there were some... concerns. Charlie dives into what we should be worried about and what we should let go. [The Athletic]
*How’s about the full division? Seems like a good time to preview that. [Inquirer]
*Here’s another one for you. People sure are high on the Islanders this year! Again! [ProHockeyTalk]
*Speaking of predictions, Frank Seravalli has some wild ones. [Daily Faceoff]
*The Experts have weighed in on all of the league’s active goaltenders to rank them in tiers. Not a ton of surprises here, but interesting nonetheless. [The Athletic]
*There are quite a lot of “old” guys playing in the NHL right now. Which is honestly kind of cool. [NBC Sports Philly]
*And finally, on hockey fandom, and fandom in general, and how sometimes life leads us into places we never thought we’d go. [BSH]</span>

The Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak expansion won’t have the features either
 Monster Hunter Rise is finally coming to PC early next year, but it won’t let players join their friends on Nintendo Switch. Monster Hunter Rise will not have cross-play or cross-save when it arrives on PC in 2022, and neither will the Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak expansion when it comes to Switch in summer 2022, Capcom announced on Tuesday. 
The developer got many requests for both features, but looked into implementing cross-play and cross-save, but was unable to “at this time,” according to a tweet from the official Monster Hunter Twitter account. While this does leave some room open for future implementation, it doesn’t seem like it’s on the way before launch.
Unfortunately, this means players who bought Monster Hunter Rise on Switch won’t be able to transfer their data to the PC version of the game, or play with friends on that platform. PC players also won’t be able to play Rise on Steam, then swap to Switch later in the year for the expansion. 
Monster Hunter Rise will be released on Windows PC on Jan. 12, 2022, while Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak doesn’t have an official release date just yet. It’s expected to come to Nintendo Switch in summer 2022.</span>

Bet you wish you held onto to that Ascendant Lens
 Last year’s Festival of the Lost event in Destiny 2 — the in-universe version of Halloween — bestowed upon players a seemingly useless gift: the Ascendant Lens. With no obvious use, many Guardians removed the item from their inventory, as players only have so much space to hold items like that. But a full year later, Bungie is offering a handsome reward of goodies for fans that held onto their Ascendant Lens through all of 2021. 
Back in 2020, when Guardians were still running the often-reused Haunted Forest activity, they could stumble upon a secret quest. After opening 45 chests with the event’s special currency, Spider would suddenly have a new quest. But talking to the NPC on the Tangled Shore didn’t …</span>

How to take on the Ridden and make it back
 Back 4 Blood is the new Left 4 Dead-like game from the studio that made, well, the original Left 4 Dead. While it’s fairly similar to its 2008 predecessor, Back 4 Blood adds some new and modern mechanics. And without a coordinated team, you can die on even the lowest difficulty. 
But we’re here to help you get zombie legs back. Here are eight tips to keep you and the rest of your Cleaner friends alive in Back 4 Blood. We’ll teach you about using Copper, buying cards from Supply Chains, and setting your difficulty.

#NoNeoNFTs
 The Neopets community is rallying in protest of the Neopets Metaverse, an NFT project that inserts a cryptocurrency scheme into the beloved pet creation website. Neopets’ small but dedicated playerbase is nearly united in its message: Get your NFTs out of my childhood nostalgia.
Neopets owner JumpStart announced the Neopets Metaverse NFT project in September to some confusion. The Neopets Metaverse Twitter account launched, seemingly, without the core Neopets team knowing about it: A Neopets representative told a fan via Twitter DM that the project wasn’t real. A day later, the Neopets team published a Q&amp;A on the site’s Neoboards to clarify that it is a legitimate, official collaboration.

The card game’s new mode is now live
 Hearthstone has slowly been branching out over the years, moving away from just supporting the standard competitive format of the card game. Sometimes that’s something as elaborate as single-player adventures or experimental like the eight player auto chess mode Battlegrounds. The game’s newest mode, Mercenaries, moves even further away from the game’s core formula in order to offer a nimble and engaging turn-based RPG. Players build up a team of mercenaries, equip them with gear and level up their abilities, then use them to brawl with a series of baddies.
In Hearthstone’s Mercenaries mode, I am able to collect a variety of heroes from the entire span of Warcraft’s vast history. The canon is entirely out the wind…</span>

Vampires, vampire hunters, and ‘Pennywise’ Roadhog are here
 Overwatch’s annual spooky season celebration, the three-week Halloween Terror event, returns to the game on Tuesday, Oct. 12. This year’s edition of Halloween Terror will see the return of the Junkenstein’s Revenge co-op mode and the requisite new batch of spooky skins.
Blizzard has whipped up five new Legendary skins for Halloween Terror 2021: Draugr Reinhardt, Satyr Lucio, Vampire Bat Echo, Coffin Bastion, and Vampire Hunter Brigitte. Players can also unlock three new Epic skins (Skeleton Genji, Einherjar Zarya, and Clown Roadhog) by winning games across Overwatch’s game modes each week. Details on how to unlock those Epic skins and other cosmetics are below.
Halloween Terror runs until Nov. 2 in Overwatch. You can check out the Halloween Terror 2021 skins in the following gallery.


Junkenstein’s Revenge will bring back the horde mode-like Arcade game type, which appears unchanged from last year. The mode’s returning missions (Vengeful Ghost, Volatile Zomnics, Mystery Swap, Frenzied Stampede, Three They Were, Shocking Surprise) will be available throughout the event.

Riot is trying to fight toxicity by removing /all chat temporarily
 League of Legends is losing cross-team chat, at least temporarily. Riot is removing the popular all chat feature (also called /all chat) in League’s next patch in hopes of combatting toxicity, the developer announced on Tuesday. The feature will remain disabled for a few patches while Riot tests player responses to its removal. 
The League of Legends developer said that all chat is a vehicle for toxic behavior and that it hopes disabling it completely will result in less bad behavior, according to the Riot’s blog post on the change. All chat is turned off by default in League of Legends already, but the new change turns it off for all players — even ones who originally opted in.
All chat is the p…</span>

You get three per year now
 When your skins don’t fit in Fortnite, you can now return them to the Fortnite depot within 30 days from purchase. Epic Games has updated its return policy for players that demand their V-Bucks back, it announced Tuesday. 
Players previously had a lifetime limit on their return requests; if you use them all, that was that. Now, players can make three return requests per year. If you decide that — oops! — this cosmetic item doesn’t quite fit your vibe, you get 30 days to submit a return request. Each request “slot” becomes available again 365 days after it was last used. Basically, there’s a maximum of three return requests to be stacked at once, and once you’ve started using them, one will be refreshed per year.


Of course, you can’t get your real money back — you just get the V-Bucks you spent returned. But it’s a welcome change for players with recent buyer’s remorse. Plus, you’d be surprised how easy it is to accidentally buy Fortnite skins on console.
Epic said the request slots won’t work for stuff like the Battle Pass, Battle Pass levels, and Llamas, which are not returnable. You can find the Return Requests page in Fortnite’s Accounts and Privacy menu, Epic said.</span>

Patch notes now credit Among Us developer Innersloth
 Epic Games said Tuesday that its Fortnite Impostors mode — which is essentially a stylized Among Us remake — is, unsurprisingly, inspired by developer Innersloth’s social deception game. Both Innersloth and Epic Games appear to be teasing a crossover event, too.
The message is just a quick reference to Among Us as Impostors’ inspiration, coming in a blog about Fortnite’s latest patch notes. But it is important, because Epic Games was sharply criticized by Innersloth developers and fans on social media for not originally crediting Impostors’ inspiration. Also, the mode’s name is a direct reference to Among Us’ alien infiltrators, which are called impostors in-game.

                    <span>In iOS 15, Apple added separation alerts to the Find My app, which let you know when you leave an AirTag or other Apple device behind. Thanks to an October 2021 firmware update, AirPods Pro now also support separation alerts. This article explains more about how they work and how you can set them up.





Called &quot;Notify When Left Behind,&quot; the ‌‌Find My‌‌ separation alerts in ‌iOS 15‌ let you know every time you are separated from your item at an unknown location, which can be helpful for items you take with you while traveling or visiting public locations. Like ‌AirPods Pro‌, for example.

                    <span>Apple Watch Series 7 customers are starting to see their orders ship ahead of launch day on Friday, 15 October.





Some customers who obtained a launch day delivery of the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ started to see their order switch to &quot;Preparing to Ship&quot; over the weekend and now orders are starting to ship. New Apple devices are typically marked as shipped as the release date approaches, even if the item itself has been in transit for some time.



The ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ features larger displays and casing sizes, the S7 chip, improved durability, new options colors for the aluminum models, and faster charging. Pre-orders opened on Friday, October 8, and the first ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ orders are set to arrive one week later on Friday, October 15.



There were some indications that the launch of the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ may be delayed prior to its announcement and some customers are now facing delays of up to several months for new orders. Select Apple Store locations will likely have limited in-store availability of the new device starting this Friday.

                    <span>Google is winding down its Material Design custom UI for iOS apps to switch to pure UIKit, according to Google&#x27;s design chief for Apple platforms Jeff Verkoeyen.





Google&#x27;s suite of apps for iOS and iPadOS, including Gmail, Google Maps, Google Photos, Google Drive, and YouTube, have used custom user interfaces that mirror the experience on Android for almost a decade. The purpose of these Material Design guidelines was to unify software design as much as possible across desktop, mobile, and the web for a consistent experience.



In a recent Twitter thread, Jeff Verkoeyen explained that going forward, Google will switch to using the design of UIKit, Apple&#x27;s framework for building interfaces in iPhone and iPad apps. Verkoeyen said that previously UIKit was not viable due to &quot;ga…</span>

                    <span>From an editors’ note appended to a New York Times report over the weekend, about COVID-19 vaccinations for children:
An earlier version of this article incorrectly described actions
taken by regulators in Sweden and Denmark. They have halted use of
the Moderna vaccine in children; they have not begun offering
single doses. The article also misstated the number of Covid
hospitalizations in U.S. children. It is more than 63,000 from
August 2020 to October 2021, not 900,000 since the beginning of
the pandemic.
The report is from Apoorva Mandavilli, the reporter who replaced longtime science report Donald J. McNeil on the Times’s COVID beat — the same reporter who last month approvingly quoted an epidemiologist who was against booster shots for adults on the nonsensical grounds that “the added benefit may be minimal — and obtained just as easily by wearing a mask, or avoiding indoor dining and crowded bars.”
The difference between 63,000 and 900,000 hospitalized children is not a small error — it’s more than an order of magnitude difference. If nearly a million U.S. children had been hospitalized from COVID-19, our entire perception of this pandemic would be fundamentally different. How did this error even make it past editing? It’s not even a remotely plausible figure given our lived experience of this pandemic.
Here’s a good example of how mind-boggling this error is. The median household income in the U.S. is about $68,000. Imagine if The New York Times ran a story about economic policy which stated that the average household income in the U.S. was $900,000. That’s preposterous. Yet that’s exactly how bad the science reporting at the Times has gotten — an error of that magnitude regarding a crucial COVID statistic went into print.

The Flyers’ season opener is just days away and now we know exactly who will be playing!
 The Philadelphia Flyers made their final moves and announced their opening roster for the 2021-22 season on Monday. There were only a few question marks left –– maybe only one, actually –– and we got our answers.
It was originally thought that the Flyers would go with a 20-man roster to begin the season, but they have one more: Kevin Hayes will start on the active roster rather than injured reserve after surgery last month.
The Flyers’ final cuts are Jackson Cates, Nick Seeler, Cam York, and Garrett Wilson. All four of those players will start the season in the AHL with the Lehigh Valley Phantoms. 
The only “disappointing” cut, after Morgan Frost was demoted last …</span>

The Flyers claimed Patrick Brown off waivers on Monday, possibly rounding out their forward group for the season opener.
 The Philadelphia Flyers may have found their 12th forward. They claimed center Patrick Brown off waivers from the Vegas Golden Knights on Monday.
Brown, 29, made his NHL debut with the Carolina Hurricanes in the 2014-15 season. He played parts of three seasons with the Canes, recording two points (one goal, one assist) in 28 games.

Sometimes it takes something else to like something else.
 I’ve been getting back into professional wrestling. What was a quasi-unrelated hobby of mine throughout my school years — motivated mostly by having a family friend that got the WWE pay-per-views for free through his telecommunications job, back when they weren’t available on their stupid subscription network — was just something to completely divert what I thought my interests were. I was this snobby teenager that thought I knew absolutely everything and the perfect trajectory of what to become, teaching music at some university somewhere or being lucky enough to perform for a living. That’s dumb! Who realistically thinks about their future like that?
Wrestling didn’t fit in with that archet…</span>

A test drive with Xbox’s racer offers much more than just postcard scenes and car cheesecake
 La Gran Caldera, Forza Horizon 5’s stratovolcano, takes both the player and the game’s decadelong promise — if you can see it, you can drive to it — to new heights. And it’s not just the postcard views from the summit; the journey up either side gives a good taste of what Playground Games’ latest festival has under the hood.
From the west, you ascend La Gran Caldera along a dirt road in broad, sliding turns; from the east, you get a paved route with tighter switchbacks. It’s about 15 minutes, round trip — up one side and down the other — from the central hub world. All of that time was a seamless transition.

                    <span>Ben Sandofsky, writing for the Halide blog:
The iPhone 13 Pro features a new camera capable of focusing closer
than ever before — less than an inch away. This opens a whole new
dimension for iPhone photographers, but it’s not without
surprises. Let’s take a tour of what this lens unlocks, some
clever details you might miss in its implementation, why its
“automatic” nature can catch you off guard, and much more. At the
end, we have a special surprise for you — especially those not
using an iPhone 13 Pro.
I’ll spoil it: Halide 2.5 adds a nifty macro mode for all recent iPhones, not just the iPhone 13 Pro. But of course, it works best on the iPhone 13 Pro, where it offers manual control over focus distance — useful for macro situations like trying to focus on a window pane instead of through it.

Let the numbers hang from the Farg!
 The Flyers, as an organisation, are second to none at making their alumni feel as if they are part of a pseudo family.
Though there is hardly a metric to judge this characteristic on, the Flyers, at least from observation, do a very good job at honoring their past players. Especially when they make an appearance in front of a rocking Wells Fargo Center crowd, Philadelphia knows how to make the greats of the past feel welcome, and boy do the Flyers know this.
However, there’s one aspect of honors which the Flyers can bestow that is rarely used, and may not be used for some time: jersey retirement. The last Flyer to have his jersey number retired was Eric Lindros back in 2018, and since the Flyers primarily ret…</span>

Apple Watch Series 7 Now Available for Pre-Order


Apple surprised us a bit this week by announcing just a few days ahead of time that the Apple Watch Series 7 would become available for pre-order on Friday, October 8 ahead of a launch on Friday, October 15.

                    <span>Kif Leswing, reporting last night for CNBC:
Apple filed a notice of appeal in the Epic Games case and is
asking for a stay on the injunction that lets developers add
in-app links to payment websites, according to company
representatives and documents filed on Friday.
If Apple wins the stay, which will be decided by a judge in
November, a rule change potentially allowing developers to
circumvent App Store fees of 15% to 30% may not take effect
until appeals in the case have finished, a process that could
take years.
Apple won everything in the case but that one point, but they’d like to win that point too.

Burst of energy in the middle of the second period not enough to overcome the other 50 minutes of the game.
 Alain Vigneault keeps insisting that his Flyers are getting closer — but a familiar theme keeps showing up despite those claims. 
That theme? An inability to churn out a full 60 minutes of hockey. Not 10 or 20 minutes, or even 40 — but a full 60 minutes. 
Sure it’s preseason, and the points don’t matter, but Vigneault’s Flyers turned in less than 20 minutes of quality in last night’s 5-3 loss to the Capitals. That effort, which might have been closer to the lower end of the spectrum, has followed a preseason full of half-empty efforts from the Flyers. 
The only question is just how long the Flyers will last. 
Since Vigneault took over behind t…</span>

The Flyers defenseman has terrible social media game comparatively.
 Social media is a great tool to absolutely lose some hours sinking your teeth into disheartening profiles or simply uploading the same thing over and over again in some mind-numbing ritual to get all of those precious little bursts of dopamine. For hockey players, it’s simply a place to show off fish, dogs, blonde partners, and warm-up shots.
So I was not surprised to find out that Philadelphia Flyers defenseman Ivan Provorov’s dog, Drake (a very good boy), is closing in on the top-pairing blueliner in terms of followers on Instagram. Simply who would opt to look at basic skating-around photos announcing contract extensions, knowing that he went to Mexico one time, or s…</span>

Can’t expect to win a hockey game when you only play well for ten minutes or so, fellas.
 Wrapping up the preseason, the Washington Capitals and your Philadelphia Flyers met tonight to play a hockey game. Surprisingly, it was actually pretty eventful, featuring goals, fighting, and other stuff. What happened, who were the players to watch, and why did this game matter? All of that and more below.
What went right?
Despite a dismal first period, the Flyers got things cooking midway through the second frame and flashed some legitimately exciting finishing ability. Claude Giroux opened the scoring after a dominant shift from the top line, dunking home a rebound with a smooth, patient approach:

Which packs should you invest in?
 The Sims 4 has lots of downloadable content in the forms of Expansion Packs, Game Packs, Stuff Packs, and more recently, Kits. These are all paid packages that add a plethora of new content to the game, whether it’s the ability to have a hot tub in your yard or the addition of magic and spells. Our The Sims 4 DLC guide details the best Expansion Packs, Game Packs, and Stuff Packs, according to the biggest Sims fans at Polygon.
The Sims 4 DLC, explained and priced

                    <span>From 2019 to 2021, a small Spanish football team was renamed Flat Earth FC, both as a publicity stunt and because club president Javi Poves couldn’t understand how water “curves”.
“Football is the most popular sport and has the most impact worldwide, so creating a club dedicated to the flat earth movement is the best way to have a constant presence in the media,” said Poves earlier this year. “Flat Earth FC is the first football club whose followers are united by the most important thing, which is an idea.”
The club’s crest is now a circular image of the earth, pressed flat on to all kits, and fans are encouraged to spark regular conversations in their pursuit of answers from the powers that be. The team mascot? An astronaut. It’s a radical move, but the club is bringing in supporters from afar. “It’s really amazing to be part of this amazing movement,” says Flat Earth player Mario Cardete. “I think it’s more than a club.”


During the pandemic, the club also became anti-mask and anti-vax — because conspiracy theories come in price-saving 3-packs, I guess? Poves resigned in late 2020 and the club was renamed and then purchased by a larger club to become their reserve team. The Earth remains round.

As he explained on Behance, Naumann’s process for designing these is surprisingly simple — he zooms way in on RGB noise to generate a background gradient, blurs the logo, and then refracts the background using the height map. Cool! (via moss &amp; fog)

                    <span>Apple has opted to appeal the ruling meted out by Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in the Epic Games vs. Apple lawsuit back in September, and today filed a notice of appeal with the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.





The Cupertino company is planning to appeal the ruling that would require it to change its App Store rules to allow developers to add in-app links to outside websites, which would pave the way for alternate payment options that do not require developers to use the in-app purchase system. While the appeal is ongoing, Apple has asked the court for a stay on the permanent injunction that requires it to implement those changes by December.

                    <span>Following the release of iOS 15.0.1 on October 1, Apple has stopped signing iOS 15.0, the previously available version of iOS that saw a public release on September 20. With iOS 15.0 no longer being signed, it is not possible to downgrade to that version if you&#x27;ve already updated to iOS 15.0.1.





Apple last week stopped signing iOS 14.8 as well, which means iOS 15.0.1 is the only publicly available version of iOS at this time, and those who have upgraded to iOS 15 cannot downgrade to iOS 14.



Apple routinely stops signing older versions of software updates after new releases come out in order to encourage customers to keep their operating systems up to date.



iOS 15.0 marks a  major version update introducing Focus Mode, Live Text, on-device Siri, iCloud+, Safari changes, and tons more, with details available in our iOS 15 roundup.



iOS 15.0.1 introduced a fix for a bug that prevented an authenticated Apple Watch from being used to unlock an iPhone 13 model when wearing a face mask. It also addressed a bug that could cause the Settings app to incorrectly display a storage full alert and it fixed a bug with audio meditations for Fitness+ subscribers.

                    <span>In September 2021, Apple introduced the Apple Watch Series 7, featuring larger displays, improved durability, and faster charging. This came one year after Apple unveiled the Apple Watch SE, a low-cost Apple Watch option that still offers many of the Apple Watch features that have made the device so popular over the years.





The ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ starts at $399, while the ‌Apple Watch SE‌ is priced much more competitively at $279. As these two models share many key features, including design, water resistance, and an optical heart sensor, it may not be immediately obvious which model is better for you. Is it worth purchasing the cheaper model with fewer features? Our guide answers the question of how to decide which of these two Apple Watch models is best for you.

The aluminum Apple Watch Series 6 was available in Space Gray, Silver, Gold, Blue, and (PRODUCT)RED aluminum color options, while the aluminum ‌‌Apple Watch Series 7‌‌ overhauled the lineup of colors, and is available in Midnight, Starlight, Green, Blue, and (PRODUCT)RED.



These are the same colors offered with the iPhone 13 mini and ‌iPhone 13‌, except there is a Pink option instead of Green. The new iPad mini is also available in a mix of colors, mirroring Starlight and Pink from the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ and ‌iPhone 13‌, carrying over Space Gray, and introducing a new Purple color.

Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Expercom. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.



You&#x27;ll need to sign into your Expercom account to access the special pricing and some models are already selling out, but in general, you&#x27;ll see the following prices and availability for aluminum models at the time of publication:




41mm GPS - $379.05, down from $399 (All colors)


41mm GPS + Cellular - $474.05, down from $499 (All colors except Red)


45mm GPS - $407.55, down from $429 (All colors)


45mm GPS + Cellular - $502.55, down from $529 (Midnight and Blue)


Expercom is currently quoting shipping estimates of 3–6 weeks for new orders, which may not be much different than ordering from Apple considering shipping on some models quickly slipped into November.

Now that Apple&#x27;s official specification pages have gone live, it has been confirmed that the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ models are 10.7mm thick, which is the same as the Series 6 models that have today been discontinued. Both the 41mm and 45mm casings have the same thicknesses.

                    <span>The Apple Watch Series 6, introduced by Apple in September of last year, has been discontinued following the launch of the new Apple Watch Series 7.





Following pre-orders of the Apple Watch Series 7 opening up earlier today, Apple has removed the Series 6 from its website, no longer offering it to purchase for customers. The ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ replaces the Series 6 and now leaves the Apple Watch SE, Apple Watch Series 3, and Series 7 in the lineup.



Apple announced the Series 7 earlier last month but declined to offer availability dates until earlier this week. Between the Series 7&#x27;s announcement and pre-orders, Apple kept the Apple Watch Series 6 available for purchase on its website, but many models were unavailable and out of stock.



The Series 7 is Apple&#x27;s most high-end Apple Watch model, featuring advanced health features and display technology. The Series 7 starts at $399, with the most expensive configuration having a $1499 price tag. 



The ‌Apple Watch SE‌ is the mid-level Apple Watch model; starting at $279, the SE offers customers basic Apple Watch features without advanced functionality, such as a blood oxygen sensor. The Apple Watch Series 3, introduced five years ago, remarkably remains in the Apple Watch lineup and starts at just $199.

                    <span>Apple this month started including 7-day complimentary AppleCare+ coverage with new products purchased through its stores in Australia, including any new Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV, AirPods, HomePod mini, and more. The complimentary coverage is automatically included with the purchase of a qualifying new Apple product.





The addition was brought to our attention today by MacRumors reader Jack Jacobs, but based on recent updates to the AppleCare+ terms and conditions in Australia, it appears the change was implemented last week, on September 30.



The complimentary AppleCare+ period provides the same coverage as a paid AppleCare+ plan, including coverage for up to two incidents of accidental damage, according to the terms and conditions. After the complimentary coverage expires, customers may purchase AppleCare+ as a one-time purchase or on a monthly basis.



It&#x27;s unclear why Apple implemented this change, but it could relate to strong warranty protections under Australian Consumer Law. The complimentary AppleCare+ coverage is not available in the United States or other countries that we checked.

                    <span>Apple Watch Series 7 pre-orders began minutes ago and some configurations are already facing extended delivery estimates into November on Apple&#x27;s online store in the United States, including some aluminum and stainless steel options.





Some customers have expressed their frustration that Apple did not provide more details on Series 7 configurations and pricing prior to pre-orders beginning, forcing some people to decide which model they wanted to purchase in the heat of the moment. For customers who did not manage to pre-order their desired Apple Watch for launch day delivery, some configurations will likely be available for Apple Store pickup on launch day.



Apple Watch Series 7 pricing starts at $399 for aluminum models, $699 for stainless steel models, and $799 for titanium models. Apple has finally updated its Apple Watch Studio page that helps with choosing a case, size, and band, and the Apple Watch comparison page is also now updated to reflect the Series 7&#x27;s tech specs.



Apple Watch Series 7 will begin arriving to customers and launch in stores on Friday, October 15.

                    <span>Apple is now accepting pre-orders for the Apple Watch Series 7 models through its online storefront and the Apple Store app. Pre-orders are available in more than 50 countries.





There were no major design changes to the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ as was rumored, but the new models feature a larger display with slimmer bezels and new 41mm and 45mm case sizes.



Charging is 33 percent faster thanks to efficiency improvements, and Apple is using a more durable crack-resistant front crystal. This is also the first Apple Watch to have an IP6X certification for dust resistance in addition to its WR50 water resistance rating.



The ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ is available in aluminum, stainless steel, and titanium, with pricing that starts at $399. Apple is also offering Nike and Hermes models.



‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ models did not launch alongside the iPhone 13 models because of production issues that may result in supply constraints. For that reason, customers hoping for an ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ on launch day should make sure to order early.



Customers who pre-order one of the new Apple Watch models can expect to start receiving their devices on Friday, October 15, the official launch date for the Series 7.

                    <span>Apple suppliers in China are scrambling to keep production on track ahead of the busy holiday season in the face of widespread power outages in the country, according to a new report from Nikkei Asia.




Widespread power outages in China are reigniting a push by tech manufacturers to shift production away from Asia&#x27;s biggest economy, with suppliers to Apple, Amazon and others scrambling to keep production on track ahead of the busy holiday season.



At a midsize electronics accessories maker in Zhongshan, Guangdong Province, power outages have become the new normal.
One source who spoke to Nikkei said power outages had been sporadic since mid-September, but that now they get notice every week telling them which days the following week that power will be cut. Apple suppliers have …</span>

                    <span>A Google executive is extending an open hand to help Apple adopt RCS, a new communication protocol called Rich Communication Services to iPhone and iPad, that would replace standard SMS and offer improved cross-platform messaging capabilities.





In a tweet, Hiroshi Lockheimer, Google&#x27;s senior vice president of Android, said that &quot;group chats don&#x27;t need to break this way,&quot; referring to a sub-tweet about the inconvenience Android and ‌iPhone‌ users have in communicating via messages. Alluding to the RCS protocol, Lockheimer goes on to state there is a &quot;Really Clear Solution&quot; and that he is offering an &quot;open invitation to the folks who can make this right,&quot; with the &quot;folks&quot; in question being a reference to Apple.



Google has been rolling out RCS for the past several years, and in July, all three major carriers in the U.S. pledged to adopt RCS, which, compared to SMS, offers support for higher quality photos and videos, audio messages, improved security, and better group chats. 



With RCS, Android to Android messaging communication will become fully end-to-end encrypted. In contrast, Android to ‌iPhone‌ communication often referred to as the &quot;green bubble,&quot; will be less secure due to Apple&#x27;s unwillingness to adopt RCS.

                    <span>Apple&#x27;s online store is down as of writing as the company prepares to open pre-orders for the Apple Watch Series 7, but unusually Apple still hasn&#x27;t officially provided full pricing information for the new models.

                    <span>From a Yahoo News story that’s as insipid as you suspect it is from the headline (“Decade After Jobs’ Death, Has Apple Traded Magic for Profit?”):
But are these game-changing innovations in the post-Jobs era?
“Apple lost the ability to bring out products that could
revolutionize a market,” said Tech industry analyst Rob Enderle of
Enderle Group. “They became a financially-focused company very
effective at milking its faithful users,” he added.
Enderle, in May 2015 — mere weeks after Apple Watch shipped — declared it “obsolete” and a month later called it a “failure”.
Keep in mind I linked earlier today to a survey that suggests 30 percent of U.S. teenagers now wear an Apple Watch.

                    <span>CNet’s Connie Guglielmo, writing about a bit from Michael Dell’s new autobiography, Play Nice But Win:
In 1997, Jobs rejoined a struggling Apple after it acquired Next
for $429 million, and he pitched Dell on another business proposal
(as Jobs was evaluating Apple’s Mac clone licensing project,
which he ultimately shut down). Jobs and his team had ported the
Mac software, based on Next’s Mach operating system, and had it
running on the Intel x86 chips that powered Dell PCs. Jobs offered
to license the Mac OS to Dell, telling him he could give PC buyers
a choice of Apple’s software or Microsoft’s Windows OS installed
on their machine.
“He said, look at this — we’ve got this Dell desktop and
it’s running Mac OS,” Dell tells me. “Why don’t you license
the Mac OS?”
I’m not saying Dell is lying…</span>

                    <span>Cultured Code’s renowned to-do app Things added support for Markdown back in August. It’s really well done. You might think that as the creator of Markdown, that I’m in favor of seeing it in use everywhere. That is wrong. In fact, in recent years I think Markdown is in use in far too many places where something truly WYSIWYG is called for.
Things does Markdown right. It doesn’t hide the Markdown formatting characters, it just styles them. Effectively, the notes field for tasks in Things is still just plain text. It’s just styled nicely if you write that plain text in Markdown. That’s the right way to do Markdown. Don’t hide the formatting characters; just style/color them.

True story: I put the dark version of this wallpaper on my iPhone 13 Pro review unit. My son came into my office, saw my lock screen, and commented that he had the same wallpaper installed. I had never once steered his attention in the direction of Basic Apple Guy. Just pure serendipity and similar taste.

From a note to clients by analyst Harsh Kumar that landed on my
desktop Tuesday:
Apple’s share of smartphone ownership remains near record highs in
Piper Sandler’s Taking Stock with Teens Fall 2021 survey (here).
Of the ~10,000 respondents, 87% have an iPhone, which is slightly
below the 88% record set in the Spring 2021 survey. In addition,
the iPhone could return to record highs due to the 88% purchase
intention among teens. […]
A record 30% of teens own an Apple Watch in the Fall 2021 survey.
Apple also has 86% market share among teen smart watch owners.
Larissa Faw, writing for Forbes in January 2013:
Ultimately, in the eyes of today’s youth, massive popularity has
watered down Apple’s coolness. “Teens are telling us Apple is
done,” says Tina Wells of the youth marketing agency Buzz
Marketing Group. “Apple has done a great job of embracing Gen X
and older [Millennials], but I don’t think they are connecting
with Millennial kids. [They’re] all about Surface tablets/laptops
and Galaxy.”

                    <span>Andrei Frumusanu, writing for AnandTech:
In the GPU side, Apple’s peak performance improvements are off the
charts, with a combination of a new larger GPU, new architecture,
and the larger system cache that helps both performance as well as
efficiency.
Apple’s iPhone component design seems to be limiting the SoC from
achieving even better results, especially the newer Pro models,
however even with that being said and done, Apple remains far
above the competition in terms of performance and efficiency.
Overall, while the A15 isn’t the brute force iteration we’ve
become used to from Apple in recent years, it very much comes with
substantial generational gains that allow it to be a notably
better SoC than the A14. In the end, it seems like Apple’s SoC
team has executed well after all.
A thorough review, as usual. Interesting to contrast with Dylan Patel’s much-publicized “Apple CPU Gains Grind to a Halt and the Future Looks Dim” hot take last month, just after the Apple event. The A15 seems more about efficiency — and thus extending battery life — than going faster, but it does go faster, too.

The end is near!
 We’ve reached the end, folks! The Flyers are closing out their preseason with a game against the Capitals. The last time we saw the Capitals, the Flyers picked up their first (and only) win of the preseason over them. The Caps were without many of their top contributors in that game, so the Flyers were able to take advantage of that, but they likely won&#x27;t have the same chance tonight. It’s the last tune-up before the regular season, and all of the regulars are back in the mix. The first real test of what this team, in its most complete form, can do is here.

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *It’s the last game of the preseason tonight and precisely one week until the real season starts! Don’t know about you guys but it’s very exciting!! Anyhoo, Rasmus Ristolainen has not been good. Pretty much ever. But that doesn’t mean he can’t be good now! [Inquirer]
*Big news yesterday was the Flyers announcing their two new inductees into the franchise Hall of Fame. [BSH]
*All of the candidates were clearly deserving of a spot, but it’s hard to argue against their two selections. [Flyers]
*If you had to pick one Flyer to be traded this season, who’d you go with? [The Athletic]
*Teams USA and Canada have already started to name players for their respective Olympic National Teams, which is wild. [ProHockeyTalk]
*Speaking of Canada, the teams up there are looking forward to being able to play teams down here again. [ProHockeyTalk]
*Carey Price has voluntarily entered the league’s player assistance program; here’s hoping he’s able to conquer whatever he’s fighting right now. [Habs Eyes On The Prize]
*Robin Lehner’s recent comments have put the spotlight on the NHL’s reliance on medication, name sleep aids. Why? Because sleeping is a big problem for these guys. [Sportsnet]
*What if instead of New Year’s resolutions we made New Season’s resolutions? Like, for example: “be kinder to each other” or “settle down it’s just sports.” [The Athletic]
*And finally, this week’s brand new Flyperbole takes on the goal song controversy. Which you know will be hilarious. [BSH]</span>

Fans say the change goes against a pledge to only sell cosmetics
 Marvel’s Avengers is now selling XP boosters — paid consumable items called Hero’s Catalysts in the game’s marketplace — as part of an update to Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics’ game that rolled out Thursday. The change isn’t sitting well with Marvel’s Avengers players, who say that the developer has gone back on its pledge to only offer paid microtransactions for cosmetic items, like skins and other flourishes.
The latest patch for Marvel’s Avengers updated the in-game marketplace to add a Consumable category, which now sells Hero’s Catalysts and Fragment Extractors, two consumable items that already existed in the game. Previously, the Marketplace only sold cosmetic items, like…</span>

All the cards a Cleaner could ask for
 Back 4 Blood has a big warning if you attempt to jump in solo, and it’s started to freak some players out. But have no fear, zombie loners: Back 4 Blood with bots isn’t as bad as it sounds. 
If you go into the menu and select Solo Campaign in Back 4 Blood, you’ll see a scary message:
Uses solo decks created in the Fort Hope deck menu. Maps and objectives will be adjusted. Matchmaking and player invites are disabled. Earning Supply Points is disabled. Stat tracking is disabled. Earning progress towards Accomplishments is disabled.

All of that sounds very punishing, like Turtle Rock Studios would really rather you not experience its game this way. But a solo campaign is actually…</span>

Turtle Rock Studios’ modernized zombie shooter keeps it fresh
 If you’ve never fought off a horde of zombies while Dick Dale’s (and Pulp Fiction’s) “Misirlou” blares on a beat-to-shit jukebox, by all means, give it a go. That’s how one of the missions toward the middle of Back 4 Blood’s first act ends. While a group of survivors tries to escape by bus, you and your crew — the Cleaners — get to play bait. And nothing captures the attention of zombies quite like surf rock. 
The jukebox defense is a rare moment in Back 4 Blood where you get to just “be cool, Honey Bunny” instead of stressed. As fans of Left 4 Dead, the spiritual predecessor to Back 4 Blood, know, the zombie horde is something to take seriously. And th…</span>

Meet the Chemtech and Hextech Dragons
 League of Legends works on a seasonal model, where developer Riot Games starts off a fresh year with lots of changes to the competitive game. This upcoming preseason is no exception, and fans can expect big changes to Summoner’s Rift on PC. 
On Thursday, Riot released a video called “Preseason 2022 and the State of the Game,” in which the developer discussed new champion balance — and admitted that some recent champions have had a few too many tools in their belt — as well as new mythic and legendary items, changes to the runes system, new bounties for objectives and towers, and the star of the preview: some wild new dragons.


Dragons are a powerful map objective. They spawn in the river pit on the bottom side of the map, and can come in one of a few elemental varieties. Each elemental dragon changes the terrain of the map, and offers buffs when killed, making it an important task for teams to prioritize.
Preseason 2022 is adding two new dragons. The Hextech Dragon offers gates around the map that allow for teleportation. The Chemtech Dragon grants players extra damage when their health is low, and when they die, they get a second shot at killing their enemies with a short-lived ghost form. In addition, the Chemtech Dragon creates camouflage zones around the map to hide teams. Sneaky!
Preseason 2022 will be available on the game’s test environment in a couple of weeks, and Riot will dial back these new changes if they disrupt the game a little too much. Right now, League of Legends esports teams are competing in the game’s yearly Worlds tournament. Arcane, a television series that explores Hextech and Chemtech in the cities of Zaun and Piltover, will debut on Netflix in November.</span>

Head to the EDZ for some Exotics
 The weekly Exotic item merchant, Xur, hangs out in random locations around the world of Destiny. In Destiny 2, he can appear all over the map, as well as inside the Tower. This week, you can find Xur in the EDZ, standing on a bluff overlooking the Winding Cove.

Growth comes in the form of little moments 
 In Sable, you can sit and enjoy the view. No, not just stand there until an idle animation has your character pop a squat. You can press a button to make the red-cloaked main character sit down cross-legged. This little flourish isn’t key to completing the game — you don’t need it for quests, or to solve puzzles — but it captures the ethos of the game perfectly. Sable’s world is gorgeous and vast, and part of the joy of playing is simply taking a moment to sit and take it all in.
Sable is the debut game from Shedworks — a two-person team based out of the U.K. consisting of Daniel Fineberg and Gregorios Kythreotis. It’s a sweeping, third-person open-world adventure set in a vast desert landscape where you play …</span>

GTA 3, Vice City, and San Andreas get updated in The Definitive Edition
 Grand Theft Auto 3, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas are being updated and re-released on modern platforms later this year, Rockstar Games announced Friday, confirming a series of leaks. The trio of groundbreaking GTA games will collected as Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy — The Definitive Edition, and will feature improved visuals and other enhancements.
Rockstar’s collection promises “across-the-board upgrades including graphical improvements and modern gameplay enhancements” for all three games, “while still maintaining the classic look and feel of the originals.” Rockstar promises more details in the coming weeks, and warns that it will begin removing existing versions of those classic GTA games from digital retailers next week.
Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy — The Definitive Edition is coming to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC (via the Rockstar Games Launcher), Xbox One, and Xbox Series X in 2021. The collection is also coming to Android and iOS devices in 2022.
The release of Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy — The Definitive Edition is timed with the 20th anniversary of Grand Theft Auto 3’s original release on PlayStation 2. Rockstar said on its website that it plans to celebrate the anniversary in Grand Theft Auto Online, promising commemorative clothing and liveries, and teasing “some unusual activity occurring in and around Southern San Andreas.”</span>

Here is a potentially familiar scene. You are exhausted after working a full day, the sort of day when you felt like your attention was drawn in 20 different directions, where you were ricocheting between obligations and meetings and running six minutes late to pick-up and realizing that if you didn’t put that load of laundry in the wash now, at 9 pm, the rest of the week could very well collapse in on itself. You answered emails while stirring something on the stove. You answered different emails while half-listening to a story from a family member or roommate. You might have squeezed in some time for exercise, but you spent most of that time thinking about work:…</span>

                    <span>Walnut is a white-naped crane that lives in a Virginia endangered species breeding facility. She’s 23 years-old, was raised by humans, and developed a reputation for murdering potential mates. But Walnut eventually found a good match in bird keeper Chris Crowe, a 42 year-old human who she has bonded with. Crowe, as part of his duties at the zoo, has embraced his role as Walnut’s mate in order to inseminate her with semen from a male crane.
That summer, however, Crowe noticed that Walnut seemed interested in, well, him. When Crowe stopped by her yard, she would bow her head and raise her wings — motions that Crowe now recognizes as the first moves of a mating dance. “At first, I thought that she was just excited to see me,” Crowe says. “But then I’d see the other pairs doing the same things…</span>

                    <span>The 10 year anniversary of Steve Jobs death took place earlier this week, sparking tech leaders to share their stories of Apple&#x27;s former CEO.





Dell CEO Michael Dell spoke to CNET, reminiscing about the time that Steve Jobs aimed to get Dell to license Mac OS to run on Intel-based PCs and how that might have changed the PC industry.



As the story goes, Jobs first approached Dell about a partnership after being ousted from Apple and establishing NeXT. Jobs wanted Dell to use the NeXT operating system on Dell PCs, and he claimed that it was better than Windows.



Dell told Jobs that it wasn&#x27;t going to happen because there were no applications for it and &quot;zero customer interest.&quot;



After Jobs rejoined Apple, he once again attempted a software licensing deal, trying to…</span>

                    <span>Apple&#x27;s in-app purchase requirements are anti-competitive, the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) has decided, reports Reuters. The ACM has ordered Apple to make changes to the rules that force developers to use in-app payment options.





The Dutch antitrust watchdog has been investigating Apple since 2019, and while the probe started out as a look into whether Apple&#x27;s App Store practices are an abuse of dominant market position, it was scaled back to focus on dating apps.



Tinder owner Match Group said that Apple&#x27;s in-app purchase were preventing it from directly communicating with customers about payments.

                    <span>Apple&#x27;s iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max models exclusively support a video recording feature called ProRes, which allows you to capture, edit, and share professional quality video. Here&#x27;s how to enable it on your iPhone with the iOS 15.1 beta.





Aimed at professionals, the ProRes codec offers higher color fidelity and less compression, and it is often used for commercials, feature films, and TV broadcasts, which is testament to the high quality results that it can achieve.



A one-minute 10-bit HDR ProRes video takes up 1.7GB in HD mode. For that reason, recording ProRes video at 4K at 30 frames per second requires 256, 512, or 1TB of ‌iPhone‌ storage capacity.

Public beta testers can download the macOS 12 Monterey update from the Software Update section of the System Preferences app after installing the proper profile from Apple&#x27;s beta software website.



‌macOS Monterey‌ introduces quite a few major updates for the macOS operating system. When released, Universal Control will let a single mouse, trackpad, and keyboard be used across multiple Mac or iPad devices, and it&#x27;s now possible to AirPlay directly to a Mac from an iPhone, ‌iPad‌, or even another Mac.

Adobe is adding moving overlays like snowflakes or sparkles that can be added to photos, along with animated frames. These can be saved as MP4s and shared as videos on social media networks.

                    <span>Apple is looking to expand CarPlay&#x27;s functionality to include controls for core car functions such as the air conditioning system, radio, speedometer, seats, and more, according to a new report from Bloomberg.





The project, internally codenamed &quot;IronHeart,&quot; is still in its early stages but would include Apple working with carmakers to expand ‌CarPlay‌&#x27;s functionality to control core car functions. Beyond apps for music and navigation, ‌CarPlay‌ doesn&#x27;t let users control any aspect of the car itself. This new iPhone-based project would be looking to change that.

The company is working on technology that would access functions like the climate-control system, speedometer, radio and seats, according to people with knowledge of the effort. The initiative, known as &quot;IronHeart&quot; inte…</span>

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/07/iphone-14-hole-punch-design-with-notch-rumor/">

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(8 min)</span>
                    <span>The iPhone 14 won&#x27;t rely entirely on a hole-punch cutout to house the TrueDepth camera system, possibly meaning Apple may retain the notch alongside a hole-punch design, according to a new rumor from Weibo.





Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has reported that for at least the high-end 2022 iPhone models, Apple will use a hole-punch design, similar to those of some flagship Android smartphones. Following Kuo&#x27;s report, Apple leaker Jon Prosser shared renders of what he claims to be the design of the ‌iPhone 14‌. 



Even if the ‌iPhone 14‌ introduces a hole-punch design, it will be hard for Apple to abandon the notch altogether, according to a now-deleted post on Weibo from @PandaIsBald. The account, which accurately predicted that the ninth-generation iPad would be announced at the September Apple event, claimed that it is &quot;unlikely&quot; that Apple will replace the notch entirely with a hole-punch cutout, and instead, the ‌iPhone 14‌ may continue to feature a notch but with a smaller footprint. 



With the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro, Apple did make the notch smaller in width but slightly taller. Apple did this by shrinking the component sizes of the TrueDepth camera system and reengineering the internals. Apple this year also moved the earpiece to the top of the bezel, freeing up space in the notch. 



Reporting on a hole-punch design for next year, Apple analyst ‌Ming-Chi Kuo‌ did not provide details on how Apple will house Face ID on the high-end ‌iPhone 14‌ models if it uses a hole-punch design. 



Today&#x27;s rumor from Weibo claims that Touch ID will not be making an appearance under the display next year, meaning Face ID may continue to be the only biometric authentication option available to ‌iPhone 14‌ users.

                    <span>Apple has started making a scaled down &quot;Apple TV+&quot; app available on select 2016 and 2017 LG smart TVs. The app is appearing on LG&#x27;s content store in several regions including Germany, Poland, and the Nordic countries, and its existence is confirmed in an LG support document.

First spotted by FlatpanelsHD, the app interface looks very similar to the standard Apple TV app, but it only allows owners of the older webOS-based TVs to watch TV+ content. The iTunes Store and Watch Now tabs have been removed from the top navigation menu, leaving just three options there: ‌Apple TV+‌, Search, and Settings.



The fully fledged ‌Apple TV‌ app, which is available on select Samsung, LG, and Vizio TVs, allows users to stream TV shows and movies from ‌Apple TV+‌, access à-la-carte ‌Apple TV‌ Channels and their iTunes libraries, as well as buy or rent more than 100,000 shows and movies from the iTunes Store. The same services can also be accessed on select Roku and Amazon Fire TV devices.

                    <span>Apple&#x27;s newsroom and leadership pages are both currently experiencing some errors, leading to the appearance of some changes to Apple&#x27;s leadership.





From our knowledge, Apple&#x27;s leadership and newsroom pages have been throwing up errors for the past two hours or so, and it seems to be that Apple is making server-side changes. In an oddity of those changes, Apple mistakenly listed Phil Schiller as Apple&#x27;s senior vice president of worldwide marketing, a role he stepped down from in August of last year to become an Apple Fellow. Apple moments later took down Schiller&#x27;s biography and the entirety of the leadership page. 




Apple&#x27;s website accidentally reinstated Phil Schiler as SVP of marketing


Apple&#x27;s newsroom is where the company issues press releases, updates, and more, while the leadership page lists all of Apple&#x27;s executives. No other pages on Apple&#x27;s website currently seem to be impacted, and it remains unclear whether this is simply an error or telling of something more coming soon. We&#x27;ll update this post when there are any changes.



Update: Moments after we published this article, Apple&#x27;s newsroom and leadership pages were reverted back to their normal states, correctly listing Greg Joswiak as the SVP of marketing and ‌Phil Schiller‌ as an Apple Fellow.

Paddle said it will have a &quot;highly competitive fee structure&quot; with a 10% fee for transactions under $10 and a 5% plus $0.50 fee on transactions over $10.

                    <span>To commemorate the 10th anniversary of Steve Jobs passing away on Tuesday, Apple shared a short film called &quot;Celebrating Steve&quot; on its website, and Apple has now made the video available on YouTube for those who may have missed it.






Apple describes the short film as a tribute to Steve Jobs and a celebration of his life and his extraordinary vision. The video includes many photos and short clips of Steve Jobs from throughout his life, ranging from his early days at Apple with fellow co-founder Steve Wozniak in the 1970s to introducing the original iPhone in 2007.



&quot;Steve believed that &#x27;people with passion can change the world for the better,&#x27;&quot; said Apple in the video&#x27;s description. &quot;He challenged us to see the world not for what it was, but for what it could be. And he helped so many of us see the same potential in ourselves.&quot;



Steve Jobs passed away October 5, 2011 at the age of 56. Apple&#x27;s CEO Tim Cook and former design chief Jony Ive are among those who have reflected on his life.

                    <span>There are some bands whose music is such a t-bone crash of a listening experience that you’re never quite ready. With each release—2015’s Dirty Demo, 2017’s Meathead, and the newest release, Gun—Ingrown have again and again caught the hardcore fanbase unawares and unprepared. In fact, even after dozens of listens, restarting Gun at track one […]

                    <span>Paddle:
The Epic Games v. Apple verdict clears the way for app creators to
choose an alternative to Apple’s payment system (and its 15-30%
fee!). But choose the wrong provider and you’ll be burdened with
managing payment and subscription logic, taxes, fraud, and buyer
support.
Paddle In-App Purchase will let app creators replace Apple’s
In-App Purchase without worrying about any of that.
Paddle is charging a 10 percent commission for transactions under $10, and 5 percent plus $0.50 per transaction at or above $10.
It’s unclear to me exactly how Paddle’s SDK works. They’re calling it “in-app purchase”, but it sounds like it redirects to Paddle’s website in Safari (or whatever your default browser on iOS is). If it redirects to a website, I think it might be allowed; if they’re processing transactions in-app, it’s not going to be allowed.

                    <span>Jeff Johnson:
For the past several days at least, Google search results have not
included AMP links on iOS 15, but they still include AMP links on
iOS 14. I’ve determined that Safari’s User-Agent makes the
difference. (You can spoof the User-Agent on iOS using the
Safari web inspector on macOS.) […]
Important Update: I’ve received a statement from Danny
Sullivan, Google’s public search liaison: “It’s a bug specific to
iOS 15 that we’re working on. We expect it will be resolved soon.”
What a weird bug. It’s made weirder by the (I think) coincidence that there a bunch of popular new extensions for Safari that redirect AMP links to regular non-AMP web pages. I’ve used all three of these extensions, and they’re all great:
StopTheMadness — Johnson’s own $8 extension, that offers a whole bunch of functionality to block shitty website behavior.


Amplosion — $3 extension from Apollo developer Christian Selig. Wins for best icon for sure.


Overamped — $2 extension from Joseph Duffy. Simple and focused.



From the DF archive, January 2017: “The Problem With AMP”.

Two men who are the epitome of what it means to be a Flyer.
 Today the Flyers announced the 2021 inductees into the Flyers Hall of Fame, Paul Holmgren and Rick Tocchet.
Congratulations to Flyers legends Paul Holmgren and @RealRocket22, who will be inducted into the Flyers Hall of Fame during a pregame ceremony on Tuesday, Nov. 16! https://t.co/OTGhLFyc36
— Philadelphia Flyers (@NHLFlyers) October 7, 2021



Holmgren has one of the more illustrious careers in Flyers history. He amassed 500 games played with the Flyers and posted 50 points in 67 playoff games, including 20 in 18 when the Flyers went to the Final in 1980. He then went on to be a coach for the team from 1988-1992 with the difficult task of following up Mike Keenan who went …</span>

Think I’ll have myself a beer...
 Steve and Eamon discuss the finalists for the Philadelphia Flyers’ goal song for the 2021-22 season and lament the fact that, yet again, “Whoomp! There It Is” has been robbed. The guys also discuss Morgan Frost being sent to the Phantoms, the bottom six options, Robin Lehner’s recent tweets about the Flyers and Alain Vigneault, and expectations for Carter Hart.

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *We knew the cuts were coming down the pike today, but not sure any of us expected that Morgan Frost would be cut from the team before the last preseason game was even played. Certainly an interesting decision, if nothing else. [BSH]
*Here’s the thing: Frost is definitely going to play for the Flyers this season. Probably early on. For whatever reason, the coaching staff wants him to get some reps up in Allentown. There’s no reason at all to worry. Probably. [BSH]
*Charlie gets even deeper into why this move shouldn’t be taken to mean more than it does. [The Athletic]
*It was a surprise though! No getting around that. Mostly because while Frost didn’t light the world on fire he certainly wasn’t bad. And he certainly wasn’t less effective than Jackson Cates. [NBC Sports Philly]
*The Flyers, who very clearly picked the new goal song months ago and decided to make a fun “fan vote” charade of the whole thing, have narrowed it down to three choices. [Flyers]
*THEY ARE ALL BAD. [BSH]
*Anyway let’s turn the focus to something good, shall we? Namely, Joel Farabee. Who is very good. And is planning to be better. [Inquirer]
*And finally, back to the bad, Friedman’s latest Thoughts shed some light on what went wrong for the Flyers last season in the wake of Lehner’s comments about AV. Spoiler alert: literally everything. [Sportsnet]</span>

After over a decade, Halo may finally be back
 Despite the hype, Halo Infinite’s first two multiplayer test weekends didn’t grab me. I was initially impressed by its “classic” Halo feel. But despite its pre-release state reminding me of the glory days of Halo 3, I got bored after just a few matches, and began to wonder if a classic arena shooter is even something I want in my life in 2021. 
But I held out hope for my favorite Halo mode, Big Team Battle, to eventually punch my ticket for the Halo Infinite hype train. And after a weekend of playtime in Infinite’s largest maps, with more teammates and power weapons, I now find myself comfortably sitting in coach, actively awaiting that Dec. 8 release date. While it’s still not finished, Halo Infi…</span>

The focus returns to Steph’s story
 Life is Strange: True Colors centers on Alex Chen and her once-estranged brother Gabe, but Life is Strange: Wavelengths, the DLC released in October, refocuses the story to True Colors’ important side character, Steph Gingrich. People who played Life is Strange: Before the Storm know her fairly well, as will anyone who pursued a romance with her in True Colors.
Almost more of an epilogue to Before the Storm than a prologue to True Colors, Wavelengths is the best of Life is Strange, fleshing out the vaguely supernatural world with a character grounded in reality. Wavelengths is a much smaller experience than True Colors, set entirely inside the Haven Springs record store Alex comes to know and love. It’s an intimate l…</span>

Trademark filings highlight EA’s possible plans for a new name
 Earlier Thursday, EA Sports’ top executive said the company is reconsidering its naming-rights agreement with FIFA and could rebrand its top-selling soccer series. A couple of new trademark applications in Europe could point to a name the publisher has in mind.
EA Sports FC is the name filed just last week with the United Kingdom’s Intellectual Property Office and the European Union Intellectual Property Office. In both cases, the brand is for computer game software and online computer game entertainment. The United States Patent and Trademark Office does not have any filing or registration by that mark. EA’s European paperwork was filed on Oct. 1.

The Destiny Content Vault strikes again!
 Destiny 2’s best campaign is going the way of Cayde-6. Yes, the Forsaken campaign, alongside The Tangled Shore destination, are going into the Destiny Content Vault on Feb. 22, 2022, during the launch of The Witch Queen expansion.
For the uninitiated, the Destiny Content Vault is Bungie’s way of purging old content from Destiny 2 and re-adding original Destiny content back into the game. Last year, Bungie vaulted four locations — Io, Titan, Mercury, and Mars — and returned the Cosmodrome and several associated Strikes from the original Destiny. Destiny’s first raid also returned from the Destiny Content Vault earlier this year in a reprised format.

Oh hey there, security robot! Oh wait. OH NO
 Teardown is a terrifically fun voxel destruction game that puts the player in the shoes of a sneaky saboteur pulling off the perfect heist. The game was first showcased in 2019, and is now in early access on Steam. A significant update is on the way from developer Tuxedo Labs, and it’s big enough to constitute the “second half of the game,” although there is no release date as of yet.
What’s on the way? Some additions seem small, although they’ll likely have a big impact. The wire tool, for instance, can tether objects together — and it maintain tension, so players can get some catapult action going with the right set-up.

Designer Joe Shely steps up to lead next Diablo
 Joe Shely is the new game director of Diablo 4, Blizzard Entertainment revealed Thursday. Shely replaces former Diablo 4 game director Luis Barriga, who exited Blizzard in August in the wake of a lawsuit against the company alleging a toxic workplace environment that subjected female employees to gender discrimination and sexual harassment.
Shely has been a member of the Diablo 4 development team since 2017, Blizzard said in his official developer bio. His responsibilities include “guiding efforts to deliver the deep, compelling systems and visceral combat Diablo is known for, and has been the overall caretaker of the combat experience,” Blizzard said, and he led the team responsible for the first playa…</span>

The new season also brings back the Gulag 
 Call of Duty: Warzone season 6 is here, and the new patch brings a few big changes to the game ahead of its Call of Duty: Vanguard update. The season 6 patch brings back Warzone’s iconic Gulag, adds a few new points of interest to Verdansk, and includes some balance changes as well. 
Season 6 will be the last time Warzone players play on Verdansk, according to developer Raven Software. To send the map off in style, Raven is bringing back the classic Gulag, where players can face off in duels for a chance to return to the action. While the area is mostly the same, Raven did add a few updates to keep the arena fresh. 
Also getting a few updates in season 6 is Verdansk itself, which has been destroyed ... again. S…</span>

Top executive says the company could end a licensing partnership going back to 1993
 FIFA, whose name has become synonymous with video game soccer over the past two decades, may no longer headline EA Sports’ globally dominant franchise.
Cam Weber, EA Sports’ general manager and top executive, said Thursday in a note to players that the label is “exploring the idea of renaming our global EA Sports football games. This means we’re reviewing our naming rights agreement with FIFA, which is separate from all our other official partnerships and licenses across the football world.”
In the preceding paragraph, Weber somewhat pointedly mentioned the 300 other licensors EA pays to give the FIFA series its real-world authenticity, from the FIFPRO group lic…</span>

                    <span>A pair of 1300-year-old skis has been discovered in an ice field in Norway. They are believed to be the best-preserved ancient skis ever found — even the bindings are mostly intact. The first of the pair was found back in 2014 and its mate was recently retrieved, an expedition you can witness in the video above.
It has been seven years since the discovery of the first ski at the Digervarden ice patch. We have patiently monitored the melt of the ice patch, in case the second ski of the pair should melt out. We were back in 2016 for a general survey of the ice patch, but the ice had not retreated much then. This year, we could see on satellite imagery that the ice patch had retreated compared to 2014. We decided to send out an archaeologist to check it.


One of the things they were hoping to find is how the skier was able to maintain forward motion with the skis, especially uphill. Modern cross-country skis rely on a texture (or wax) on the bottom of the ski to grip the snow while downhill skiers can apply skins to their skis to climb uphill. More than a thousand years ago, the choice was texture or animal fur:
One of the questions raised by the ski found in 2014 was if it originally had fur on the underside. This has major implications for the use of the ski. There were no nail holes along the sides of the 2014 ski which would have been a clear sign of the fastening of the fur. However, fur can also be glued to the underside, so we could not rule it out.
A furrow on the underside along the length of the ski, as you find on other prehistoric skis (and on modern cross-country skis), would solve the question. Such a furrow would have no function with an underside covered by fur. The 2014 ski did not show a furrow, but the new and better preserved ski does! So, probably no fur-lining.

                    <span>Even for mathematically minded folks, statistics can be hard to grasp. Take statistical paradoxes for example: Simpson’s Paradox is a real mind-boggler. Ryan Anderson explains this paradox in a recent issue of Why is this interesting?
It’s simple to describe, yet it still stops me in my tracks when I see it in the wild. The paradox is that a measurable effect on a large population disappears, or even reverses when that population is split into subgroups. The cause of these results is almost always a material change in the denominators from one period to the next.
Showing is easier than telling with paradoxes, so here is a classic example: In 1995 and 1996, David Justice had a higher batting average than Derek Jeter in each year. However, Jeter had a higher cumulative batting average over those two years.


It’s true; look:

Anderson continues:
How does this work? Jeter’s 1996 stats accounted for over 92% of his total performance over the two years, as he was 20 years old and only called up to the major league for a few games in 1995. Meanwhile, Justice’s 1996 stats were only 25% of his total performance due to a separated shoulder he suffered barely two months into the season. So while Justice performed better on smaller sample size, Jeter’s 183 hits in 1996 were the strongest signal for overall performance.


Read the rest of the piece; he goes on to connect statistical paradoxes to efforts to mislead people about the pandemic and vaccine effectiveness.

                    <span>A bug in iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 is preventing Safari from loading AMP links for Google search results, but the issue is not intentional and Google is preparing a fix that&#x27;s set to be released in the near future.





Developer Jeff Johnson today published a blog post speculating on whether Google had intentionally disabled AMP links for Google search results in Safari on devices running ‌iOS 15‌ (via MacStories) after he noticed their disappearance. 



As he noted, Safari&#x27;s Google search results do not include AMP links on devices running ‌iOS 15‌, but AMP content still loads in iOS 14 and in other browsers like Chrome for iOS. Johnson wondered whether Google had decided to disable AMP in ‌iOS 15‌ due to the prevalence of Safari extensions that feature AMP-blocking features.




It&#x27;s a bug specific to iOS 15 that we&#x27;re working on. We expect it will be resolved soon.
— Danny Sullivan (@dannysullivan) October 6, 2021
 


That Google search results do not include AMP links in the Safari browser on ‌iOS 15‌ is a bug, according to Google&#x27;s public search liaison Danny Sullivan. In a tweet, Sullivan said that Google is working on a fix and that the issue should be resolved soon.



For those unfamiliar with AMP, it stands for &quot;Accelerated Mobile Pages&quot; and it is a feature that&#x27;s designed to make webpages load faster on mobile devices. AMP pages are cached, allowing them to be presented to users more quickly, but it&#x27;s something that is not always popular with users because some website features are disabled when AMP is used.



When Google does re-implement AMP links, iOS 15 Safari extensions like Amplosion are available to redirect AMP links to standard webpages.

                    <span>Apple today released the third beta of iOS 15.1 to developers for testing purposes, and the update introduces some new camera features for iPhone 13 Pro users.





ProRes Video


Today&#x27;s beta adds support for ProRes video capture with the standard iPhone camera app. It can be toggled on by opening up the Settings app and selecting the &quot;Camera&quot; section. From there, tap on &quot;Formats&quot; and toggle on &quot;Apple ProRes.&quot;





ProRes capture is limited to 30fps at 1080p on devices with only 128GB of storage, but higher capacity devices can record in 4K. Apple says that a 10-bit HDR ProRes video takes up 1.7GB in HD mode.



Macro Toggle


To take macro shots, the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ models swap over to the Ultra Wide lens when the ‌iPhone‌&#x27;s camera gets close to an object, which some people do not like because it can be difficult to get a shot with the camera constantly swapping back and forth.





iOS 15.1 beta 3 adds a toggle to turn off Auto Macro, which will prevent the Camera app from automatically switching to the Ultra Wide camera for macro photos and videos.



The feature can be enabled in the Camera section of the Settings app by scrolling down and toggling off the &quot;Auto Macro&quot; option.

For those unfamiliar with AKKO, it&#x27;s a company that offers an AppleCare-like set of protection plans for your devices. There&#x27;s smartphone-only coverage that&#x27;s priced between $5 and $12 per month with full insurance that&#x27;s on par with Apple&#x27;s, but what really sets AKKO apart is its &quot;Everything Protected&quot; Plan.



With the &quot;Everything Protected&quot; Plan, users get coverage for one smartphone and all of their other electronic devices, up to 25 items in total. So for one $15 per month fee, AKKO offers protection for a whole wide range of devices, both new and used.

To install ‌‌‌watchOS 8.1‌‌‌, developers will need to download the configuration profile from the Apple Developer Center. Once installed, ‌‌‌watchOS 8‌‌‌ can be downloaded through the dedicated Apple Watch app on the iPhone by going to General &gt; Software update.



To update to new software, an Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery life, it must be placed on the charger, and it needs to be in range of the ‌‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌‌.



We don&#x27;t yet know what&#x27;s new in ‌watchOS 8‌ and there were no new features found in the first two betas, but we&#x27;ll update this article should anything new pop up in the third beta.

Developers can download the new tvOS 15 beta by downloading a profile onto the ‌Apple TV‌ using Xcode.



Other than new releases, tvOS updates are often minor in scale, focusing on under-the-hood bug fixes and improvements rather than major outward-facing changes. We don&#x27;t yet know what&#x27;s included in tvOS 15.1, but this beta fixes a bug with VoiceOver, according to Apple&#x27;s release notes. 



Though we don&#x27;t often know what&#x27;s new in tvOS during the beta testing process, we let MacRumors readers know when new updates are available so those who are developers can download it upon release.

                    <span>iPhone 13 Pro models feature an upgraded Ultra Wide camera with autofocus that enables macro photography, allowing users to take close-up photos of flowers, insects, and other objects that are as close as 2cm to the camera lens.





Apple&#x27;s Macro Mode is limited to iPhone 13 Pro models, but those with older iPhones can now get in on the action, as Halide today announced that it has updated its popular third-party camera app with its own Macro Mode, with no accessories required. The feature is available on all iPhones with a Neural Engine, including the iPhone 8 and newer.



Halide said its Macro Mode first checks which one of your iPhone&#x27;s camera lenses can focus the closest and switches to it. Then, the feature provides ultra-precise focus control down to the sub-millimeter to ensure the photo looks sharp. Finally, an AI-based feature called Neural Macro further enhances close-up details of the photo once shot.




Halide&#x27;s sample photo shot with its Macro Mode on iPhone 12 Pro


If you already have an iPhone 13 Pro model, Halide said its Macro Mode essentially stacks on top of Apple&#x27;s Macro Mode, resulting in &quot;staggeringly close, microscope-like shots that are even more highly magnified.&quot;



To turn on Macro Mode in the Halide app, first tap the AF button to get into manual focus, and then tap the flower button. The feature is available as a free update for all existing users, with version 2.5 of the app rolling out on the App Store today. For new users, the Halide app is priced at $2.99 per month or $11.99 per year, or $49.99 as a one-time purchase.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Apple today reminded developers that App Store apps that allow for account creation must also allow users to initiate deletion of their account from within the app starting early next year. The requirement applies to all app submissions starting January 31, 2022.





The requirement follows updates to the App Store Review Guidelines in June. Apple encouraged developers to review any laws that may require them to maintain certain types of data, such as electronic health records, sales records, and warranty records.



As discovered earlier this week, Apple also confirmed that a revamped &quot;Report a Problem&quot; link has returned to App Store app pages on iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey so users can more easily report concerns with apps they&#x27;ve downloaded, such as scams. This feature is currently available for users in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States, and Apple says it will expand to other regions over time.



&quot;Problematic apps diminish the App Store experience for users and developers, and we&#x27;re constantly expanding techniques to identify even more types of problematic content for removal,&quot; said Apple. &quot;If we suspect that a developer has engaged in purposeful manipulation, fraud or abuse, we will notify them and take action. Consequences may include removal of apps and may impact their Apple Developer Program membership.&quot;

                    <span>Apple on Tuesday released firmware version 4A400 for the second-generation AirPods, AirPods Pro, and AirPods Max. On the AirPods Pro, the update enables a new Conversation Boost feature that Apple previewed at WWDC earlier this year.





Apple says Conversation Boost is designed to help people with mild hearing challenges stay more connected in conversations. The feature uses the AirPods Pro&#x27;s beam-forming microphones to boost the volume of a person talking in front of you, making it easier to listen to a face-to-face conversation, and there is also an option to reduce ambient noise.



How to Turn On Conversation Boost


To turn on Conversation Boost, the AirPods Pro must be updated to firmware version 4A400. AirPods Pro firmware updates are installed over the air, but there …</span>

                    <span>The European Commission is planning to charge Apple with anticompetitive behavior with regards to Apple Pay, since it is the only payment service that can use the iPhone&#x27;s Near-Field Communication (NFC) chip, Reuters reports.





EU antitrust investigator Margrethe Vestager has been investigating ‌Apple Pay‌ since June last year, but the European Commission has since centered its focus on the NFC chip alone, according to individuals familiar with the matter speaking to Reuters.



The NFC chip in the ‌iPhone‌ and Apple Watch enables tap-and-go contactless payments, but ‌Apple Pay‌ is the only payment service that can use this hardware. On Android devices, multiple payment services can offer contactless payments using the NFC chip, but on the ‌iPhone‌, no rival services are allowed to leverage the NFC hardware.



The Commission&#x27;s preliminary concerns also reportedly include Apple&#x27;s terms and conditions on how ‌Apple Pay‌ should be used in merchants&#x27; apps and on websites. Concerns may have been raised by ‌Apple Pay‌&#x27;s wide reach and better user experience on the ‌iPhone‌ compared to other services, and accelerated by the growth of contactless payments during the global health crisis.



The EU competition enforcer is now believed to be preparing a statement of objections to charge Apple with anticompetitive conduct, which is expected to be sent to the company next year. The antitrust charge could put Apple at risk of a large fine and force it to open the NFC chip to rival payment systems in Europe. Similar investigations have also been opened in Australia.

                    <span>LG Display has begun developing an OLED panel for a 12.9-inch iPad model that features improved brightness, longevity, and durability, according to The Elec.





The Elec recently reported that Apple is preparing to release two new iPad Pro models with low-power LTPO OLED displays in 2023 or 2024. The new models could feature improved ProMotion with a wider range of refresh rates.



Further to that report, The Elec is now claiming that LG Display is planning to begin production of a 12.9-inch OLED display for an ‌iPad‌ between the end of 2023 and 2024. Samsung Display is also expected to be preparing to supply panels for the OLED ‌iPad Pro‌ models alongside LG Display, now that the OLED iPad Air that Samsung was working on for 2022 has reportedly been canceled.

                    <span>Following complaints of &quot;jelly scrolling&quot; on the iPad mini 6 display, another issue has gained traction online that also has to do with the device&#x27;s 8.3-inch Liquid Retina LCD panel.





A poster on Reddit brought attention to a discoloration and distortion issue that they were having when touching the screen with the iPad in portrait orientation.

I got my 64gb Wi-Fi iPad Mini 6 just about a week ago and noticed that there seems to be an LCD clearance issue – if you put your mini in vertical orientation (with the power button on the top right) push very lightly on the screen and you will see distortion and discoloration about an inch down and in from the top right. On most models this will happen in three spots along the top of the display (when vertical).

                    <span>In a new interview, Apple CEO Tim Cook said he&#x27;s worried about the &quot;endless, mindless scrolling&quot; behavior that social media inspires people to undertake and is generally concerned that people are &quot;using technology too much.&quot;





The interview conducted with Bustle touched heavily on Apple&#x27;s support of Shine, an app designed to fight social stigmas around mental health issues and is &quot;another powerful example of how technology can be used to help improve people&#x27;s lives,&quot; according to Cook. During the interview, Cook said that &quot;mental health is a crisis&quot; and that he tackles the day-to-day stress of being Apple&#x27;s CEO by meditation and &quot;being out in nature and feeling so insignificant in the world.&quot;

                    <span>Safari 15 has faced a barrage of complaints about its controversial new design, and while Apple has listened to user feedback and reversed some changes or made them optional, many users still struggle to discern an active tab from a background tab on the Mac browser because of the inverted shading.





Unfortunately for users who do not like the new design, Apple has not made any changes to the shading of tabs in either the Safari 15.1 beta or the latest version of the experimental Safari Technology Preview browser. 



Fortunately however, developer Zhenyi Tan was inspired by John Gruber&#x27;s Daring Fireball article about the issue and has since come up with a simple Safari extension called ActiveTab that provides a solution.



ActiveTab simply makes it easier to spot the active tab in Safari on Mac by drawing a line underneath it. There are eight colors to choose from, and the line below the tab can be customized to be between 1 and 7 pixels wide. 





As Zhenyi notes, the extension works best with the &quot;Separate&quot; tab layout selected and &quot;Show color in tab bar&quot; disabled in the Tab section of Safari&#x27;s Preferences. Zhenyi also cautions that ActiveTab will not work reliably if you have so many tabs in a window that the tab bar becomes scrollable.



ActiveTab is available for $1.99 on the Mac App Store, with no in-app purchases, no ads, and no tracking.

                    <span>MG Siegler:
Yes, I know there is no shortage of third party weather apps. Some of them are great. But the devil is always in the defaults. And that default Weather widget is about to land on tens of millions of iPad screens with the launch of iPad OS 15 this fall. And with that, Apple will be sending tens of millions of dollars (maybe more?) indirectly to weather.com — which, incidentially is now owned by IBM. Insert the Steve Jobs giving the finger image here.
Do weather.com executives hold some sort of blackmail on the iPad OS dev team within Apple? I can’t come up with a better explanation.
The whole situation is bizarre. Apple just redid the Weather app in iOS 15 to be more beautiful. And the widgets reflect that. And they throw it all in the trash compactor when it comes time to drill down on the iPad.
The lack of a built-in iPad Weather app was a little weird before, but now that they have a built-in Weather widget that, when you tap it, takes you to The Weather Channel’s janky-assed website, it’s downright bizarre.

More cuts!
 We’re not going to bury the lede here gang—the Flyers have announced their next round of cuts and there are some big surprises in here. 
The Flyers have loaned the following players to the Lehigh Valley Phantoms:
Linus Sandin
Morgan Frost
Tyson Foerster
Isaac Ratcliffe
Linus Hogberg
In addition, the following players have been placed on waivers for the purpose of being assigned to the Phantoms:
Adam Clendening
Gerry Mayhew
Connor Bunnaman
German Rubtsov
And finally, Cal O’Reilly has been released from his PTO and will report to the Phantoms. 
The Flyers’ training camp roster now sits at 24 players (excluding those who are injured), and you can see that full roster here. 
So where does that leave us? The Flyers are carrying ei…</span>

If you were hoping the Flyers would have an improved goal song this season, things aren’t looking too great!
 After two miserable seasons of “Feel the Shake” by Jetboy being the Flyers’ goal song, the team is mercifully (?) moving on to something different for the 2021-22 season.
Unfortunately, a new goal song doesn’t necessarily mean it’ll be a better goal song.
Last month, the Flyers announced they were turning to the fans in an effort to find a new goal song, and they tested some of the top fan-submitted requests throughout the preseason. Among the tested goal songs were “Here Comes the Hotstepper” by Ini Kamoze, “Call on Me” by Eric Prydz and, Broad Street Hockey’s personal favorite, “Whoomp! (There It Is)” by Tag Team.

The 22-year-old finds himself in a unique spot having fallen into a top-nine role despite having logged just two games in the last year.
 So here’s the thing about Morgan Frost through three preseason games — it’s too early to worry about Morgan Frost. 
Now that the obvious is out of the way — and we can’t stress this enough — it’s just too soon to worry about Morgan Frost, we can delve into some of what we’ve seen from the play that suggests that you should…well, you get the idea. 
For starters, the three games the 22-year-old has played in the last two weeks is more than he played all of 2020-21 — not including the lost workout time and bizarre rehabilitation schedule as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. And we’re not even talking about a play…</span>

Some observations for your morning…
 Well gang, the Flyers played their second game of the back to back last night with very much their B squad, against a more loaded Islanders team, in their AHL arena, in a game you could only watch on a sort of lackluster stream on their website and socials. It went about as well as you might have expected. The Flyers showed a bit of flash but the mismatch got them in the end, and they dropped this one 3-0. It was a bit of a yawner, but we do still have some takeaways to hit on before we can finally put this one to bed.

A bit of offense was done
It was a bit of a struggle, particularly early on, for the Flyers’ offense to get rolling in this one. And in some ways th…</span>

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *There was a games yesterday, but no one could watch it. Did it really happen? Schrodinger&#x27;s Hockey Game. The Flyers lost, so yeah let’s just pretend it never happened. RECAP! 
*We DID get to watch the one before that, though. And the Flyers won, and we learned some stuff. [BSH]
*Judging by Alain Vigneault’s comments yesterday, today is the day the final roster starts to get finalized. Exciting! 
Alain Vigneault said before tonight&#x27;s preseason game that by Thursday&#x27;s practice, they&#x27;ll be down to 22-24 players on their camp roster, in anticipation of the final preseason game on Friday. So basically their final roster.
— Charlie O&#x27;Connor (@charlieo_conn) October 5, 2021



*To that end, the Flyers made some not-all-too-surprising cuts yesterday. [BSH]
*Meltzer has some thoughts on the latest at training camp. [Flyers]
*The roster isn’t the only thing that needs figuring out, though. The preseason games are a great place to try and figure out how to make your special teams actually work. [Inquirer]
*Charlie gave us 10 Things from that Boston game the other night, always good stuff. [The Athletic]
*Charlie mentions it in his article but it bears calling out: Robin Lehner has walked back his comments on AV, claiming he never meant to suggest the Flyers or Vigneault were involved in this whole medications accusation. Lehner is now involved in talks with the league to try and get some resolution. [ESPN]
*And finally, the full season predictions and models are dropping, and DGB’s got some ideas about how all 32 teams will shake out. [The Athletic]</span>

That was painful to watch, but at least it’s over.
 Before the recap something has to be said. How does NEW YORK, a city with how many local sports networks, not carry this game on TV? It’s 2021, folks, what are we doing here?
First Period
Well, it wasn’t the best of beginnings for the Phan — I mean the Flyers, as Nicolas Aube-Kubel took an early penalty leading almost immediately to a Anthony Beauvillier goal. Penalties really seemed to kill NAK last season, and have always been an issue for the tenacious winger. 
Philadelphia would get a power play of their own just minutes later, but alas would do nothing with it. Linus Sandin made a nice move in close, but newcomer to Long Island Cory Schneider was up to the task.

Valve cautions people against opening up their console 
 It’s not every day that a company posts a video tutorial on how to alter its hardware. However, Valve went slightly against the grain on Wednesday when it published a video teardown of the Steam Deck on YouTube. The video presented a perfect how-to guide for modding your Steam Deck hardware, after it launches in December. It also gave Valve the opportunity to send this PSA: Don’t modify the console, because you’ll likely ruin it. 
In the video, a Valve representative gives detailed step-by-step instructions for replacing the thumbsticks and the solid-state hard drive. The footage helps clarify what will and won’t be possible with the console once it launches at the end of the year. Because Valve’s ne…</span>

New action RPG will still have that oil paint look
 PlatinumGames is changing the look of its action-RPG for Square Enix, Babylon’s Fall, which was something of an acquired taste when it was re-revealed earlier this year. While Platinum is intentionally going for “oil painting style” graphics with Babylon’s Fall, some found the aesthetic to be too muddy and stylized. So Platinum’s changing that.
On Wednesday, PlatinumGames and Square Enix showed off the revised graphics for Babylon’s Fall, which, while certainly clearer, still maintain the studio’s “brushwork style” that’s based on classical European oil paintings. You can see the revised graphical style in the slider image below, with the new graphics shown on the right.


On Babylon’s Fall’s official website, the developers revealed the new graphics in an update from the game’s closed beta test. Regarding the graphics, the developers said, “This was an area we received many strong opinions and requests about in Phases 1 and 2 of the Closed Beta Test, particularly regarding poor visibility. Accordingly, we have been working to improve the overall visual clarity, while still keeping the distinctive classic fantasy oil painting aesthetic.”
So, yeah, things are far less blurry in the latest version of Babylon’s Fall — which does not have a release date.
Square Enix and PlatinumGames announced Babylon’s Fall way back in 2018. After a period of concerning quiet, the game reemerged this summer, with Platinum confirming that the project would be a live-service multiplayer game. Babylon’s Fall is bound for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC.</span>

Grounded’s Hot and Hazy update arrives on Oct. 20
 Grounded, the backyard survival game from Obsidian Entertainment, is getting a big update on Oct. 20. The free download will add several new areas for players to explore, including a sandbox and a pile of trash. It will debut simultaneously for both the PC and Xbox versions of the game.
Launched in July 2020, Grounded is a departure for Obsidian, which is best known for role-playing games like Outer Worlds, Pillars of Eternity, and Fallout: New Vegas.

                    <span>Using data from Johns Hopkins, this time lapse video shows the spread of Covid-19 across the US from Feb 2020 to Sept 2021. This looks so much like small fires exploding into raging infernos and then dying down before flaring up all over again. Indeed, forest fire metaphors seem to be particularly useful in describing pandemics like this.
Think of COVID-19 as a fire burning in a forest. All of us are trees. The R0 is the wind speed. The higher it is, the faster the fire tears through the forest. But just like a forest fire, COVID-19 needs fuel to keep going. We’re the fuel.
In other forest fire metaphorical scenarios, people are ‘kindling’, ‘sparks being thrown off’ (when infecting others) and ‘fuel’ (when becoming infected). In these cases, fire metaphors convey the dangers posed by people being in close proximity to one another, but without directly attributing blame: people are described as inanimate entities (trees, kindling, fuel) that are consumed by the fire they contribute to spread.

                    <span>This is Samson and Delilah, a painting attributed to the Flemish master Peter Paul Rubens that hangs in the National Gallery in Britain.

Since the late 90s, there’s been some doubt cast upon the painting’s authorship, summarized in this short video:

From a recent piece in the Guardian about an AI art-analysis algorithm that declared Samson and Delilah is not a Rubens painting:
Critics have long argued that it is only a copy of a Rubens original that is known to have been painted between 1608 and 1609 for his Antwerp patron Nicolaas Rockox which then disappeared after his death in 1640.
They argue that the National Gallery picture is a different painting, one that only surfaced in 1929, declared a Rubens by Ludwig Burchard, an expert who, after his death in 1960, was found to have misattributed paintings by giving out certificates of authenticity for commercial gain.
The picture’s critics dismiss its colours as uncharacteristic of Rubens’s palette and its composition as awkward. They question why, for example, it differs from two contemporary copies made from Rubens’s original. The toes of Samson’s outstretched right foot, for example, are cropped in the National Gallery version, while they are shown in an engraving by Jacob Matham and a painting that depicts the Samson and Delilah hanging in Rockox’s home by Frans Francken the Younger.

                    <span>So let’s say, for the sake of argument and against all scientific evidence to the contrary, the Earth was flat instead of being an oblate spheroid. What would life on a flat Earth be like? Well for one thing, gravity would present some challenges. From a 2018 piece by Doug Main at the Columbia Climate School:
People who believe in a flat Earth assume that gravity would pull straight down, but there’s no evidence to suggest it would work that way. What we know about gravity suggests it would pull toward the center of the disk. That means it would only pull straight down at one point on the center of the disk. As you got increasingly far from the center, gravity would tug more and more horizontally. This would have some strange impacts, like sucking all the water toward the center of the wor…</span>

                    <span>Back on launch day for the iPhone 13 last month, a number of Apple Card users had difficulties placing orders for their devices, with many of those users ultimately resorting to different forms of payment in order to ensure their orders went through in a timely fashion.





As shared by a number of MacRumors readers, Apple today sent out emails to affected customers, letting them know that they will be credited with the 3% Daily Cash they would have earned on their ‌iPhone 13‌ purchases even though they were unable to complete their purchases with their Apple Cards.
You successfully completed your iPhone pre-order with a payment method other than Apple Card. We understand that your initial purchase attempt with Apple Card was declined and you didn’t earn 3% Daily Cash. 



We apologize for the inconvenience you experienced and want to make it up to you. We are providing you a credit for the Daily Cash on the initial payment of your iPhone 13. You’ll see this appear as a Balance Adjustment in the Wallet app. This will also appear on your October monthly statement. 



If you would like to continue earning Daily Cash back on future iPhone payments with your Apple Card, please visit citizensoneloan.com to update your payment method.



If you have any questions, contact an Apple Card Specialist.
The 3% Daily Cash credits are already going through, with users able to check the Wallet app to confirm their credit has been received.

With the update, ‌AirPods Pro‌ and ‌AirPods Max‌ are able to take advantage of the ‌Find My‌ network, allowing them to be located through connections with the Apple devices owned by other people.



Prior to now, ‌AirPods Pro‌ and ‌AirPods Max‌ were listed in the ‌Find My‌ app, but if they were out of Bluetooth range, they would only display last known location. Through the update, the ‌Find My‌ network will provide an approximate location for the AirPods to help you get within Bluetooth range to track down your headphones using the Play a Sound feature.

                    <span>Apple device users are largely underwhelmed by the iPhone 13 lineup and the Apple Watch Series 7, according to the findings of a new survey by SellCell.





The survey asked 5,000 iPhone users aged 18 or over in the United States between September 23 and 30 what they thought of the recently announced ‌iPhone 13‌ models and ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌.



64 percent of users said that the ‌iPhone 13‌ lineup is &quot;not very&quot; or &quot;not at all&quot; exciting. 21.5 percent felt that the ‌iPhone 13‌ models are &quot;somewhat&quot; exciting, and only 14.4 percent said that they are &quot;extremely&quot; or &quot;very exciting.&quot;

All three of the AirPod models are now running 4A400 firmware, up from 3E751 for the standard ‌AirPods‌, 3E756 for the ‌AirPods Max‌, and 3E751 for the ‌AirPods Pro‌.





Apple has also released new firmware for the Beats Solo Pro, Powerbeats 4, and Powerbeats Pro.

                    <span>Apple CEO Tim Cook today reflected on Steve Jobs in a touching memo to employees that was obtained by Bloomberg&#x27;s Mark Gurman. Jobs passed away 10 years ago today at the age of 56 following a lengthy battle with pancreatic cancer. 





In the memo, Cook said that Jobs was a husband, a father, a friend, and a visionary who left an extraordinary legacy behind, adding that not a day goes by that he doesn&#x27;t think about him. Apple&#x27;s former design chief Jony Ive shared similarly heartfelt comments about Jobs this week, describing him as the most inquisitive human he has ever met.



Cook&#x27;s full memo reads as follows:
Team,



Today marks the 10th anniversary of Steve&#x27;s passing. It&#x27;s a moment to celebrate his life and to reflect on the extraordinary legacy he left behind.

                    <span>A number of banks are currently pressuring Visa to make changes to the way it processes some payments made via Apple Pay, moves that would reduce the fees the banks pay to Apple for certain transactions, reports The Wall Street Journal.





At the heart of the issue are automatic recurring payments like memberships and streaming services. Visa is aiming to change the way it issues tokens for ‌Apple Pay‌ cards such that Apple would only receive a transaction fee on an initial subscription payment and not on subsequent transactions.
When Apple introduced Apple Pay in 2014, the iPhone had already clobbered music players, cameras and GPS systems. Banks and card networks worried it also would displace card payments.



Banks agreed to pay Apple 0.15% of each purchase made by their credit cardholders. (They pay a separate fee on debit-card transactions.) Those fees account for most of the revenue that Apple makes from its digital wallet, according to people familiar with the matter.
Aside from the fee arrangement, Apple garnered several other concessions from credit card issuers as it rolled out ‌Apple Pay‌, and in exchange, Apple agreed not to launch its own credit card network to go up against Visa and Mastercard.



With the launch of Apple Card in partnership with Goldman Sachs, Apple has become more of a direct competitor to other banks, and some bank executives have reportedly been angered by Apple&#x27;s move and are seeking ways to reduce the payments they make to Apple.



Apple has unsurprisingly informed Visa that it objects to the proposed change that would reduce the fees it receives on recurring transactions, so it remains to be seen whether Visa will follow through on its plans, which are scheduled to go into effect next year.

                    <span>Apple CEO Tim Cook has previously stated that Apple&#x27;s greatest contribution to mankind will be related to health, but Insider&#x27;s Blake Dodge today reported that the company&#x27;s health team has faced internal issues and a series of high-level departures.





The report, based on conversations with 11 current and former Apple employees and the review of dozens of documents, claims that Apple&#x27;s health team has faced organizational problems that have left the group &quot;without clear direction and struggling to mesh Apple&#x27;s hardware-oriented culture with the practices of the medical business.&quot; 



Some of the employees cited in the report said colleagues faced negative treatment after raising concerns, while some employees expressed concerns about inaccurate information reaching Apple&#x27;s senior leadership, including Apple&#x27;s COO Jeff Williams, who oversees both the Apple Watch and the company&#x27;s broader health initiatives.



In a statement, Apple said many of the assertions in the story &quot;are based on incomplete, outdated, and inaccurate information,&quot; adding that &quot;any and all allegations of retaliatory behavior are investigated thoroughly and handled with appropriate corrective actions.&quot;



Insider&#x27;s report provides more details about specific allegations from within Apple&#x27;s health team.

Teen smartwatch ownership has climbed from 30 percent in the fall of 2020 to 35 percent in the fall of 2021. 30 percent of teens now own an Apple Watch, an increase of five percent from the same time last year. Apple now has an 86 percent market share among teen smartwatch owners. 



Rolex was previously the reigning most popular watch brand among upper-income teens, but Apple is now the most popular watch brand in this demographic. In the spring of this year, only 13 percent of teens intended to buy an Apple Watch, but this has now increased slightly to 15 percent.

                    <span>Apple is planning two new iPad Pro models with low-power LTPO OLED displays for release in 2023 or 2024, according to Korean website The Elec. The report claims that one of the new models will likely have a 12.9-inch display.





While the iPad Pro has featured ProMotion since 2017, the device supports a smaller range of refresh rates between 24Hz and 120Hz. Following in the footsteps of the iPhone 13 Pro, the switch to LTPO OLED display technology could pave the way for future iPad Pro models to support a wider range of refresh rates between 10Hz and 120Hz.



Refresh rates supported by 2017 and newer iPad Pro models:
120Hz


60Hz


40Hz


30Hz


24Hz
Refresh rates supported by the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max:
120Hz


80Hz


60Hz


48Hz


40Hz

In an investor note with TF International Securities, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently claimed that Apple abandoned its plans to release an iPad with an OLED display in 2022, with multiple sources now agreeing on a 2023 or later timeframe.



It&#x27;s worth noting that, back in July, Display Supply Chain Consultants analyst Ross Young claimed that the first iPad with an OLED display would be released in 2023. Young has proven to be a reliable source for display-related rumors, including accurately revealing that the new iPad mini would feature an 8.3-inch display.

                    <span>Following three months of beta testing, Microsoft has officially released Windows 11, which brings a new design, new multitasking features, and other software additions to the PC-using public.






Perhaps inspired by macOS, the main Windows 11 screen features rounded corners on several interface elements including application windows, and in combination with a new theming system that combines specific wallpapers with colors, the overall design looks modern, with more depth and less clutter than Windows 10, which is now six years old.



In the clearest design change, the refreshed desktop moves the Start menu and taskbar, interface elements that are familiar to all Windows users, to the center of the screen, a location not dissimilar to where the Dock lives in macOS.

                    <span>Apple today commemorated the tenth anniversary of Steve Jobs&#x27; passing with a special commemorative homepage on its website, including pictures and a link to a short film that captures some of his most memorable quotes and moments at Apple&#x27;s helm.





The homepage also includes a statement from the Jobs family, reproduced below:

For a decade now, mourning and healing have gone together.

Our gratitude has become as great as our loss.



Each of us has found his or her own path to consolation,

but we have come together in a beautiful place of love

for Steve, and for what he taught us.



For all of Steve&#x27;s gifts, it was his power as a teacher that has endured. He taught us to be open to the beauty of the world, to be curious around new ideas, to see around the next corner, and most of all to stay humble in our own beginner&#x27;s mind.



There are many things we still see through his eyes, but he also

taught to look for ourselves. He gave us equipment for living,

and it has served us well.



One of our greatest sources of consolation has been our association of Steve with beauty. The sight of something beautiful — a wooded hillside, a well‑made object — recalls his spirit to us. Even in his years of suffering, he never lost his faith in the beauty of existence.



Memory is inadequate for what is in our hearts: we miss him profoundly. We were blessed to have him as husband and father.
Also in commemoration, Apple&#x27;s former design chief Jony Ive has penned a remembrance of his friend and colleague for the Wall Street Journal Magazine.

                    <span>Apple&#x27;s new iPhone 13 series features its latest A15 Bionic processor, which the company says is 50% faster than the competition. That vague claim was the entry point for AnandTech&#x27;s investigation into the chip&#x27;s performance, efficiency, and graphics core improvements, and the review&#x27;s conclusions easily back it up. 




Compared to the competition, the A15 isn&#x27;t +50 faster as Apple claims, but rather +62% faster. While Apple&#x27;s larger cores are more power hungry, they&#x27;re still a lot more energy efficient.
Two new CPU microarchitectures feature in the A15, both for the two performance cores and the four efficiency cores, which are likely made on a 5nm+ process, which TSMC refers to as N5P, a &quot;performance-enhanced version&quot; of its 5nm process that allows for higher maximum frequencies.

                    <span>Apple on Friday reached a $95 million settlement that, pending court approval, will resolve a class action lawsuit that accused the company of violating the Magnuson–Moss Warranty Act and other U.S. laws by replacing customers&#x27; devices covered by AppleCare with refurbished devices, according to court documents accessed by MacRumors.





Apple&#x27;s Repair Terms and Conditions for the U.S. state that, when servicing a customer&#x27;s product, the company &quot;may use parts or products that are new or refurbished and equivalent to new in performance and reliability.&quot; However, plaintiffs in the lawsuit alleged that refurbished or &quot;remanufactured&quot; devices are not &quot;equivalent to new in performance and reliability&quot; and thus sought monetary damages from Apple.

                    <span>So many of us lost our entire world beginning in March 2020. Whether it was through the physical loss of human beings in our lives, or the perceived loss of our entire identity when we were cut off from what we’d come to know as “normal.” For some of us, it meant a reunion with […]

                    <span>When did I first see the art of Alfonso Azpiri? Most likely it was on late-night TV while I was watching Night Flight, my gateway for everything underground during the late 70s/early 80s. This was the place where you could see Heavy Metal magazine come to life. Azpiri’s work has always had an effect on me because […]

                    <span>Jony Ive, in a remembrance of his friend for The Wall Street Journal (News+):
I loved how he saw the world. The way he thought was profoundly
beautiful.
He was without doubt the most inquisitive human I have ever met.
His insatiable curiosity was not limited or distracted by his
knowledge or expertise, nor was it casual or passive. It was
ferocious, energetic and restless. His curiosity was practiced
with intention and rigor.
Many of us have an innate predisposition to be curious. I believe
that after a traditional education, or working in an environment
with many people, curiosity is a decision requiring intent and
discipline.
In larger groups our conversations gravitate towards the tangible,
the measurable. It is more comfortable, far easier and more
socially acceptable talking about what is known. Being curious and
exploring tentative ideas were far more important to Steve than
being socially acceptable.
Our curiosity begs that we learn. And for Steve, wanting to learn
was far more important than wanting to be right.

                    <span>This blog is almost 22 years old, and in all that time I’ve been solid about posting regularly — until this recent dry spell.
I skipped the summer. Last post was in June. There was just one that month, and just one in May.
I have an explanation: while my health and physical circumstances are unchanged and, happily, fine, I have not felt the drive to write here that I always felt.
I never, in all these years, had to push myself. I’d get an idea and I would be compelled to write it up and publish it. It was always that simple.
But I haven’t felt that way in many months, and I’m not sure I will again.
Maybe this is temporary, and there will be hundreds more posts to come.
But I kind of think not, because there’s a bigger issue: I expect and hope that eventually I will no longer be a public person — no blog, no Twitter, no public online presence at all.
I have no plan. I’m feeling my way to that destination, which is years off, surely, and I just hope to manage it gracefully. (I don’t know of any role models with this.)
Anyway. In case I don’t write here again — in case these are the last words of this blog — thank you. I loved writing here, and you are why.</span>

                    <span>Yesterday there was a big Facebook outage caused by BGP. I’ve been vaguely
interested in learning more about BGP for a long time, so I was reading a
couple of articles.
I got frustrated because none of the articles showed me how I could actually
look up information related to BGP on my computer, so I wrote a tweet asking for tools.
I got a bunch of useful replies as always, so this blog post shows some tools
you can use to look up BGP information. There might be an above average number
of things wrong in this post because I don’t understand BGP that well.
I can’t publish BGP routes
One of the reasons I’ve never learned much about BGP is – as far as I know, I don’t have access to publish BGP routes on the internet.

Off to the Phantoms with you. 
 At long last, the first proper round of cuts is here! With the somewhat frenetic schedule the Flyers have been dealing with to start the preseason, they’ve needed a few more bodies around to keep anybody from getting too worn down, so this has been a long time coming. It isn’t a massive trimming of the roster, but it’s something!
The Flyers have assigned the following players to the Lehigh Valley Phantoms:
Samuel Ersson
Logan Day
Samu Tuomaala
Mason Millman
Maksim Sushko
Wyatte Wylie
Max Willman
Matthew Strome
In addition, they have also returned Elliot Desnoyers to Halifax of the QMJHL. 
And there’s not too much that’s surprising here. All of these players were pretty well outside of the mix for a spot with the Flyers righ…</span>

Oh c’mon, the Islanders again? Really?
 Coming off of a second preseason victory against the Boston Bruins on Monday night, the Flyers are set for their penultimate preseason contest against the New York Islanders in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Who are the players to watch, what are the overarching story lines, and what kind of music awaits at the bottom of today’s preview? All of that (and more) below.



The Islanders
The Isles arrive in Bridgeport with their roster mostly solidified, outside of a few pieces here and there with the ability to be shuffled. Notably, standout prospect Oliver Wahlstrom has had a difficult camp according to those around the team. While it feels more likely than not that the talented shooter will m…</span>

Some observations for your morning…
 They picked up their first win of the preseason on Saturday, and since that dam was broken, the Flyers seem to be rolling here. They faced a lineup of effectively, if we’re honest here, Providence Bruins, and while goaltender Jeremy Swayman once again gave them a lot of trouble, the Flyers put together a pretty dominant effort, kept their heads down, and picked up a win in overtime. They were without a number of what should be their regulars, but they still looked sharp all the same, and there was a lot to like in this showing.

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *Back at it again tonight against the stupid Islanders. Did you miss last night? Well, the good guys won! RECAP! 
*We got a good look at Elliot Desnoyers last night, that was pretty fun. Kid looked good! [NBC Sports Philly]
*In fact it was a bit of an exhibition for a few young guys, as AV sorts out the last few roster spots. [Inquirer]
*The Flyers practiced before the games yesterday but all anyone wanted to talk about, shockingly enough, was Robin Lehner’s tweets. [BSH]
*The big takeaway from AV’s comments was that he was, more than anything, disappointed by Lehner’s accusations. [ESPN]
*The big (small?) man in charge had some things to say about Lehner’s tweets as well. [Sportsnet]
*And finally... who else forgot about this? Admit it!!!

A good ol’ fashioned preseason goalie duel!
 First Period
As to be expected with two defensively-minded squads, it was a pretty boring first 20 minutes of hockey in South Philly. Both goalies had minimal stressful situations, but both made saves when they needed to. Jeremy Swayman made a fantastic save on Nicolas Aube-Kubel who used a power move to beat the defender, and tried to score with a cross-body shot.
NAK was by far the most impressive Flyer of the period, and looked more like the player we saw come into his own in 2019-20. Last season wasn’t the season we expected from him, but with a normal training camp and normal preseason, it finally looks like the old NAK is back. 
Two youngsters on the blueline played well in Wyatt Wylie and Linus Hogberg. …</span>

Crafting is serious business
 New World offers a lush island for players to explore, and nearly everything you can encounter can be chopped down, picked up, or skinned to create materials for some kind of crafting. One of the most humble (and calming) professions is fishing. But New World’s most dedicated players aren’t fishing for fun — they’re trying to get sick buffs for their big PvP battles.
In a post on the game’s Reddit page, a user called BlakeGarrison62 explains that certain legendary fish can be crafted into a foodstuff that increases a certain stat by 40. The buff lasts 30 minutes, which is enough to turn the tide in a major battle. Certain classes, like fire mages, would see a massive increase in their damage. In short, knowledge is power, an…</span>

The Halo Infinite Technical Test finally let players into Big Team Battle last weekend
 Halo Infinite just completed its third multiplayer test weekend, and Twitter has been ablaze with various highlight clips and plays. With the addition of Big Team Battle — Halo’s large-scale multiplayer mode that features a variety of vehicles and super weapons — the clips got even more elaborate. Here’s a look at some of the most fun Halo Infinite clips we could find.
Most Halo Infinite clips out there feature one of two things: vehicles or the new grappling hook. The best clips feature both.

The Big Love Rocket, Mac’Aree zone, and certain jokes have been removed
 Blizzard is continuing to update World of Warcraft in the lead-up to patch 9.1.5. While some of these changes are gameplay related, others have to do with removing suggestive or inappropriate content from the game. 
On Aug. 27, Blizzard posted a statement on social media about upcoming changes to the game. This included “updates to improve the game environment for our community, including additional changes to some content to better reflect our shared values.”

A new look for the Doctor, plus muskets!
 Dread Hunger is an excellent social sabotage game that is currently in open access. Players take the role of a doomed expeditioner in 1847. Dark thralls from beneath the ice have taken over a small number of the crew with the intent of sabotaging the expedition and causing a whole lot of trouble for everybody. The game is moving along nicely, and is now set for a full release on Steam on Nov. 10.
While waiting for future updates, the Dread Hunger developer has released an update called Bad Medicine. The doctor class has gotten a sharp looking update, so he looks a little more distinctive among the other folks on the ship — which is useful, considering his healing perks can save the ship from disaster.

There’s also a ship armory, full of powerful muskets. The trick is that there’s an elaborate lock on the door, and it’ll take six codes gathered from around the map to crack the door open. You also want to make sure that the right person gets their hands on a musket, and not the thrall traitors, lest you find yourself in a pickle.</span>

The new season also adds Alex Mason as an Operator
 Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War season 6, the game’s last season, is coming coming this week. On Tuesday, Treyarch revealed what players can expect from the season 6 battle pass, including new Operators and new weapons for both Black Ops Cold War and Warzone. 
Cold War season 6’s battle pass will add a couple of new weapons to the game. The first is the new .410 Ironhide shotgun, which is available at Tier 15. The Ironhide is extremely slow, but it’s a heavy hitting weapon with a pretty long range one-shot kill — at least for a shotgun. The battle pass also adds the Grav assault rifle at Tier 31. The Grav will have a range similar to the QBZ-83 and the fastest muzzle velocity of any assault rifle in the game, along with a 35-round magazine on the base version.
The season 6 battle pass will include Alex Mason as the game’s newest Operator. The protagonist from the original Call of Duty: Black Ops has seen better days, but he’s back for the fight as the Cold War continues. The pass will also add several Operator skins including an Adler skin, the Aurora Borealis Mason skin, and more.
The new season patch will arrive on Oct. 6 at 12 a.m. ET for Black Ops Cold War and Oct. 7 at 12 a.m. ET for Call of Duty: Warzone. On Nov. 6, in the middle of season 6, Call of Duty: Vanguard is scheduled to be released, but it’s not clear if that will change anything about Warzone or season 6, or if we’ll have to wait for the start of a new season for the changes.</span>

Ghost Recon Frontline from Ubisoft Bucharest goes into testing soon
 The next Ghost Recon game from Ubisoft is something different: It’s a free-to-play, player-versus-player-focused first-person shooter with support for 100-plus players. It’s called Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Frontline, and it goes into testing next week in select territories. 
Ubisoft Bucharest, which developed the Tom Clancy’s HAWX games and co-developed other Tom Clancy titles, is leading development of Ghost Recon Frontline. The studio aims to combine the tactical military action of the nearly 20-year-old Ghost Recon franchise and the massive engagements of the battle royale genre. 
Ghost Recon Frontline will feature multiple game modes, but Ubisoft is specifically highlighting o…</span>

Someone help me budget this
 I love games that give me stress dreams. Something about being on the precipice of dying or just getting punched in the face — I find it all very motivating, in a Marie Kondo “I love mess” sort of way. When the table stakes feel high I get to reward my lizard brain with each newly completed task. Gridlock me in an unforgiving wave of these little to-do items, and I will sit glued to the computer for hours and hours, like the time I played Frostpunk until 3 a.m.
Gas Station Simulator is a fever dream that mixes these stressful management elements with retro graphics and an arcade minigame feel. Its look and animation are pretty hideous, and the individual elements of gameplay don’t necessarily make for a fun game on their own.…</span>

Fortnite’s Halloween event is a season within a season
 It’s Halloween time in Fortnite, and that means the return of the Fortnitemares event. In a blog on Tuesday morning, Epic Games revealed that Fortnitemares, that game’s annual Halloween spectacular, is back in 2021. But this year, Epic’s creepy bash will be bigger than ever, with new content regularly throughout October.
Players can get their hands on new and unique pumpkin and trick-or-treat costumes, as well as costumes based on Halloween classics like Frankenstein’s Monster and The Mummy. New costumes will be revealed regularly in the shop. There’s a new Short Nite — a kind of mini-film festival — coming. And Fortnite Creative players will get new content as well. The island itself will include Dual Fiend Hunters and a new crossbow-like weapon.
Last year, Fortnitemares came with the subtitle, “Midas’ Revenge,” and offered a direct story tie-in, and this year’s event involves the mysterious Cube. Epic still has more information to reveal around this year’s Fortnitemares, and will update its blog with new reveals over the next few weeks.</span>

The history and evolution of the genre
 The act of noticing something, with your eyes or hands or nose, comes naturally to humans. When you start playing a video game, it’s one of the first things you do: notice things. What buttons do I press? Which way do I go? What items can I grab? Hidden object games focus singularly on this one idea — the gameplay of searching — to create compelling environments, to tell stories, and to build out worlds.
You could argue that there are elements of hidden object games in most video games. The inherent mechanic is in reacting to things hidden in an environment, whether that’s a patterned ledge, as an environmental clue, or an object literally hidden within a space. Going even further, people have been pl…</span>

                    <span>Train wheels do not sit completely flat on the tracks — they’re designed with a slight taper that increases the stability of the train and allows the train to go around curves without any of the wheels skidding. In this short video, Tadashi Tokieda explains how those conical wheels keep trains on track.

                    <span>To raise awareness around plastic’s resistance to decomposition (it won’t break down for 1000 years), Vietnamese creative agency Ki Saigon has designed a book out of recycled plastic containing letters to read a millennium from now.
“There was a lot of trial and error” when putting the book together, says Kumkum. For starters, what does one say to their future family members? Ki Saigon decided to provide a guide for the letters, asking each participant to imagine what they would like to hear from them, given the fact the book will still be around in 1000 years. Each letter is also hand written, adding another dimension to the project while “staying true to the spirit of the project.”


A time capsule with no container needed.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/04/intel-social-experiment-pc-vs-mac-ad/">

                    <span>Intel today shared a new ad titled Breaking the Spell: Social Experiment. In the four-minute video, Intel invites 12 supposed Apple fans to a focus group showcasing features of &quot;upcoming devices&quot; that were, in fact, PCs that are already on the market. The ad was spotted earlier by French website MacGeneration.






The video starts out by saying that many Apple fans only care about Apple products, and Intel attempts to change that viewpoint. The supposed Apple fans are ushered into a room that looks similar to an Apple Store, creating the impression that they are being shown new Apple products, but the devices are actually PCs powered by Intel processors. 



According to Intel&#x27;s Ryan Shrout, the ad features each participant&#x27;s &quot;real&quot; reactions instead of scripted ones. &quot;It&#x27;s surprising to see how many people that utilize tech still don&#x27;t know the capabilities of the PC,&quot; he said in a tweet.



The ad is part of Intel&#x27;s #GoPC marketing campaign that it launched last year after Apple started transitioning to custom Apple Silicon chips in Macs. Intel even recruited former &quot;I&#x27;m a Mac&quot; actor Justin Long for some of the ads.

                    <span>Apple today informed Apple Authorized Service Providers that it will be adding the third-generation Apple TV and its AA battery charger to its vintage products list on October 31, according to a memo obtained by MacRumors.





The third-generation Apple TV was released in March 2012 and many third-party apps have already phased out support for the device. The third-generation model is also the last Apple TV that does not run tvOS, and thus lacks access to the App Store.



Introduced in July 2010, the Apple Battery Charger was priced at $29 and included six rechargeable AA batteries for use with the original Apple Wireless Keyboard, Magic Trackpad, and Magic Mouse for the Mac. Apple discontinued the charger around 2016 and the Magic accessories now have built-in batteries that can be recharged via Lightning.



In the past, vintage Apple products were no longer eligible for repairs at the Genius Bar or at Apple Authorized Service Providers, but Apple now provides service for up to seven years on vintage products, subject to parts availability.



The original Apple Watch was added to Apple&#x27;s vintage products list last week.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/04/safari-15-tab-design-complaints/">

                    <span>Safari 15&#x27;s controversial new design on the Mac has led to complaints about the way the browser indicates which tab is active.





As illustrated by Daring Fireball&#x27;s John Gruber, there was never any ambiguity about which tab is active in previous versions of Safari, as an active tab is shown with lighter shading that matches the browser&#x27;s toolbar.



In Safari 15, however, tabs have a new button-like design with a rounder and more defined appearance. Apple has also inverted its shading of tabs, with an active tab now having darker shading and inactive tabs having lighter shading. The change has annoyed Gruber and other users, as evidenced by this Reddit thread with nearly 1,000 upvotes.



&quot;The design is counterintuitive,&quot; wrote Gruber. &quot;What sense does it make that no matter your settings, the active tab is rendered with less contrast between the tab title and the background than background tabs? The active tab should be the one that pops.&quot;



In a Safari 15 window with two tabs open, especially from the same website, Gruber said determining which tab is active is basically a guessing game. Gruber acknowledged that it is easier to discern the active tab when more than two tabs are open, but he said the confusion with exactly two tabs should have been reason enough to scrap the design change.



&quot;I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I closed the tab that I needed because of this,&quot; one Reddit user expressed in frustration.



Unfortunately for users who do not like the new design, Apple has not made any changes to the shading of tabs in either the Safari 15.1 beta or the latest version of the experimental Safari Technology Preview browser.

Throwboy is well-known for its pillows that look like classic Apple products, but the company also has a popular line of T-shirts that feature designs immediately recognizable by Apple fans.





The 9:41 shirt highlights the exact time that Steve Jobs unveiled the original iPhone, and a &quot;Think Different (again)&quot; shirt pairs the famous phrasing with rainbow coloring.





There&#x27;s a &quot;1984&quot; design featuring a mouse pointer and Apple&#x27;s iconic typeface, along with a &quot;Command&quot; shirt, which is Throwboy&#x27;s most popular. It has the same iconic Command logo featured on all of Apple&#x27;s Macs.

Magazine. In his first public comments about Jobs since delivering his eulogy in 2011, Ive reflected on his memories of Jobs across nearly 15 years of working together.





&quot;We had lunch together most days and spent our afternoons in the sanctuary of the design studio,&quot; wrote Ive. &quot;Those were some of the happiest, most creative and joyful times of my life. I loved how he saw the world. The way he thought was profoundly beautiful.&quot;



Ive said that he and Jobs had a shared curiosity that formed the basis of a joyful collaboration. &quot;He was without doubt the most inquisitive human I have ever met,&quot; wrote Ive.

                    <span>At its September special event, Apple introduced the Apple Watch Series 7. The Series 7 replaces the Apple Watch Series 6, which was announced in September of 2020, as the company&#x27;s flagship wearable.





The Apple Watch Series 7 offers a number of upgrades and improvements on last year&#x27;s Series 6, offering a larger display with bigger casing sizes, faster charging, and the S7 chip, for a price starting at $399. 



Although the Apple Watch Series 6 has now been discontinued by Apple, it continues to be available at many third-party resellers. If you already have an Apple Watch Series 6, you may be wondering if it is worth upgrading to the Series 7. You may also be using an older Apple Watch and are looking to upgrade, but cannot decide if you should buy the Series 6 or the Seri…</span>

                    <span>Amazon today is offering $10 in Amazon credit when you spend $100 or more on the Apple Gift Card. This card is digital and will be delivered to you via email, and the offer will automatically be applied at the checkout screen.

Amazon&#x27;s wording on the sale is somewhat confusing, so if you don&#x27;t see the sale automatically applied at checkout, you can use the code APPLEOCT at the checkout screen to get the deal. For most shoppers, however, the deal should apply automatically.



It&#x27;s been just over a year since we last tracked deals on iTunes gift cards, because Apple phased those out in favor of the new Apple Gift Card. This makes Amazon&#x27;s sale today of particular note, since you won&#x27;t find a straight cash discount on these cards again, but can at least get credit added to your Amazon account.




$10 CREDIT

All of the Apple Gift Cards on this page are supported under the new promotion, as long as you customize one to be worth $100 or more. The gift cards are sold by ACI Gift Cards, LLC, which is owned by Amazon and was related to iTunes gift card discounts in the past.

                    <span>Today marks the 10th anniversary of Apple&#x27;s marketing chief Phil Schiller and former iOS chief Scott Forstall introducing the iPhone 4S with an all-new voice assistant, Siri.





&quot;For decades, technologists have teased us with this dream that you&#x27;re going to be able to talk to technology and it&#x27;ll do things for us,&quot; said Schiller, at a small press conference at Apple&#x27;s former Infinite Loop headquarters.



Schiller then invited Forstall on stage to provide a live demo of Siri. The crowd applauded as he demonstrated what are now basic Siri tasks such as checking the weather, setting an alarm, and searching the web, as Siri was the first system-level voice assistant on a smartphone. A decade later, however, it is a commonly held opinion that Siri has fallen behind competitors like…</span>

                    <span>Apple today announced that pre-orders for the new Apple Watch Series 7 will start on Friday, October 8, with availability on Friday, October 15. 





While Apple announced the Series 7 alongside the iPhone 13 last month, the company didn&#x27;t provide any information on availability besides saying it will be available &quot;later this fall.&quot; The new Apple Watch will officially be available for pre-orders at 5 a.m. PDT on Friday, October 8, and will start shipping a week later on Friday, October 15.



The Series 7, compared to the Series 6, features a larger display with slightly more rounded corners, which allows the display to appear to curve on the sides. The new Series 7 also sports improved IP6X certification for dust resistance in addition to WR50 water resistance. The new watch, however, keeps the same CPU as the Series 6. 



The Series 7 comes in five aluminum case finishes, including a refined blue case, (PRODUCT)RED, midnight, starlight, and green. Stainless steel options in silver, graphite, and gold stainless steel alongside &quot;Apple Watch Edition&quot; in titanium and black titanium will also be available. The Series 7 starts at $399 and joins the Apple Watch SE and the Apple Watch Series 3 in the lineup.

                    <span>After being removed several years ago, Apple has restored the &quot;Report a Problem&quot; option on the App Store in an effort to flag issues and combat scams.





Spotted by Richard Mazkewich and Kosta Eleftheriou and highlighted by The Verge, the option allows users to report individual ‌App Store‌ listings in iOS 15. When selected, the option directs users to a website with a drop-down menu to report ‌App Store‌ violations, including a specific option to &quot;Report a scam or fraud.&quot;



The previous option, which was difficult to access, allowed users to &quot;Report suspicious activity&quot; redirected to Apple Support. Users were only able to report &quot;a quality issue&quot; with apps if they had actually paid for a scam app or in-app purchase, meaning that there was no ability to easily report obvious scams.




In a major reversal, Apple quietly added back the “Report a Problem” @AppStore button in iOS 15: pic.twitter.com/UopiPDEV7e
— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) October 3, 2021
 




The &quot;Report a Problem&quot; option appears to be rolling out slowly, starting with free apps with in-app purchases on the ‌App Store‌ in the United States. The addition comes just days after Apple added the ability for users to rate their own apps on the ‌App Store‌.

                    <span>Apple has managed to ramp up chip orders for its new iPhone 13 lineup by reducing equivalent orders for the older-generation iPhone models that the company still sells, according to a new DigiTimes report.




Apple has scaled down its chip orders for older-generation iPhones, while ramping up wafer starts at TSMC for its iPhone 13, the sources said. Apple has also not made any changes to its chip orders placed with TSMC for 2021, the sources noted.
Apple continues to sell the iPhone 12, iPhone 12 mini, and iPhone 11 on its online store, and also offers the iPhone SE 2 for users who prefer an affordable ‌iPhone‌ with a Home button. Apple discontinued the ‌iPhone‌ XR, ‌iPhone 12‌ Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max when it launched the ‌iPhone 13‌ series in September.

                    <span>The iPhone 13 Pro costs Apple around $20 more to build compared to last year&#x27;s iPhone 12 Pro, but despite the lower margin of revenue for the company, the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ still starts at the same $999 price point as last year&#x27;s entry-level Pro iPhone.





TechInsights did a costs analysis breakdown of the new ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌, finding that due to higher component costs related to the improved camera, A15 Bionic chip, ProMotion displays, and presumably the large battery, the newest ‌iPhone‌ costs $570 to build, while the ‌iPhone 12‌ Pro cost merely $548. Compared to the Samsung Galaxy S21+, both iPhones are however significantly more expensive to build.





The increase in build costs from the ‌iPhone 12‌ Pro to the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ is notable but not as pronounced as last year&#x27;s increase from the iPhone 11. The ‌iPhone 12‌ introduced 5G support, a new 5nm chip, and the return of flat edges. Those changes resulted in the iPhone 12 being 21% more expensive for Apple to build than the ‌iPhone 11‌.



In the run-up to the launch of the iPhone 13 and ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ last month, a report suggested that due to increased costs for chip production, Apple would increase the price of the iPhone 13 as a means of compensating. That did not occur, and Apple instead kept the same price points for the ‌iPhone 13‌, on top of introducing more aggressive carrier subsidies. Another report suggested that Apple was looking at new ways to assemble the cameras in an ‌iPhone‌ to save costs.

                    <span>Apple has toggled end-to-end encryption for Safari bookmarks in iCloud, further expanding the type of user data that the company fully encrypts, offering the highest level of privacy and data protection.





Spotted on Reddit, an update to Apple&#x27;s &quot;iCloud security overview&quot; page has indicated that alongside Safari tabs and history, Safari bookmarks are now end-to-end encrypted, meaning no one, not even Apple, can access users&#x27; saved Safari bookmarks. Based on the timing of the update, Apple likely did this change around the release of iOS and iPadOS 15. Apple didn&#x27;t respond to a request for comment.



With Safari bookmarks now an added data point that&#x27;s end-to-end encrypted, what remains not end-to-end encrypted is worth noting. ‌iCloud‌ backups, for example, are only protected using 128-bit AES encryption, alongside Photos, Reminders, Notes, and more. In recent months, Apple has come under pressure to make iCloud Photos and ‌iCloud‌ backups fully end-to-end encrypted, but the company has yet to make those changes.

                    <span>Tuesday marks 10 years since Apple co-founder Steve Jobs passed away, and those who met him have begun to share stories about his life.





CNET&#x27;s Roger Cheng today recounted his memory of Jobs visiting The Wall Street Journal&#x27;s headquarters in New York to offer him and a small group of other reporters an early look at a prototype iPhone, shortly after the device was unveiled in 2007.



Cheng revealed that when one reporter asked about the iPhone&#x27;s durability, Jobs reacted by tossing the prototype he was holding into the air toward the center of the room, resulting in a small gasp followed by immediate silence as the device hit the carpeted floor. Cheng said the iPhone survived unscathed, adding that the move was the kind of calculated risk that Jobs was known to take as a showman.



&quot;The memory underscores the kind of lengths Jobs went to in order to make an impression,&quot; wrote Cheng. &quot;Imagine how disastrous it would&#x27;ve been if that iPhone had broken or shut down in front of so many journalists.&quot;






Jobs famously introduced the original iPhone as if it were three separate products: a widescreen iPod with touch controls, a revolutionary mobile phone, and a breakthrough internet communications device. The crowd at Macworld San Francisco erupted with cheerful applause upon realizing that Jobs was referring to a single device.



Jobs passed away October 5, 2011 at the age of 56. Apple maintains a Remembering Steve page on its website with messages from people all over the world.

Tom Strickx and Celso Martinho, writing for the Cloudflare blog:
“Facebook can’t be down, can it?”, we thought, for a second.
Today at 1651 UTC, we opened an internal incident entitled “Facebook DNS lookup returning SERVFAIL” because we were worried that something was wrong with our DNS resolver 1.1.1.1.  But as we were about to post on our public status page we realized something else more serious was going on.
Social media quickly burst into flames, reporting what our engineers rapidly confirmed too. Facebook and its affiliated services WhatsApp and Instagram were, in fact, all down. Their DNS names stopped resolving, and their infrastructure IPs were unreachable. It was as if someone had “pulled the cables” from their data centers all at once and disconnected them from the Internet.
How’s that even possible?
DNS is deep dark stuff, and even at the pidgin level at which Daring Fireball operates, it terrifies me. Can’t even imagine how complicated it is at Facebook’s scale. What a fiasco.

                    <span>Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai, reporting for Motherboard:
A company that is a critical part of the global telecommunications
infrastructure used by AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, Verizon and several others
around the world such as Vodafone and China Mobile, quietly
disclosed that hackers were inside its systems for years,
impacting more than 200 of its clients and potentially millions of
cellphone users worldwide.
The company, Syniverse, revealed in a filing dated September 27
with the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission that an
unknown “individual or organization gained unauthorized access to
databases within its network on several occasions, and that login
information allowing access to or from its Electronic Data
Transfer (EDT) environment was compromised for approximately 235
of its customers.”
For a moment I thought, 235 customers — that’s not too bad. Then I realized that Syniverse’s “customers” are entire carriers, not individual people. So, yeah, this is bad.
Syniverse repeatedly declined to answer specific questions from
Motherboard about the scale of the breach and what specific data
was affected, but according to a person who works at a telephone
carrier, whoever hacked Syniverse could have had access to
metadata such as length and cost, caller and receiver’s numbers,
the location of the parties in the call, as well as the content of
SMS text messages. […]
The company wrote that it discovered the breach in May 2021, but
that the hack began in May of 2016.
Not what you want.

                    <span>John Jurgensen, writing for The Wall Street Journal (News+):
Now he’s attempting to re-engage with a show that offers fewer
jokes and a more earnest agenda. With his new biweekly series,
“The Problem With Jon Stewart,” his first challenge is getting
people to notice it at all. Apple TV+ is decidedly more plush but
less entrenched than basic cable.
Fans will find aspects of “The Problem With Jon Stewart” familiar.
In front of an audience, he sits at a table for an opening
monologue (now wearing a T-shirt and bomber jacket instead of a
suit and tie). He twirls his pen, pauses for deadpan stares into
the camera, stifles giggles behind his fist and makes
self-deprecating cracks like, “I am what’s left of Jon Stewart.”
Breaking from his previous format, the show includes unscripted
segments in the show’s writers’ room, where Mr. Stewart and his
staff banter over each episode’s topic (expanded on in a weekly
companion podcast). A separate panel discussion captures the
show’s sober tone.
I watched the first episode and was bored to tears. I certainly sympathize with the plight of U.S. veterans who’ve been gravely harmed by the burning of toxic waste, but the show itself felt like a droll hour-long lecture — not a good sign when the show was in fact only 40 minutes long. Strong “When is this going to be over?” vibes. It was like being stuck back in school.
I’m not saying Stewart can or should only do comedy. I like serious issue-based shows, too, but the good ones, like 60 Minutes, move along at a fast clip. John Oliver’s Last Week Tonight devotes itself to the most serious issues in the world today, but the show is entertaining, fast-paced, and funny as hell. It moves. The premiere of The Problem With Jon Stewart can only be described as “plodding”. I’ll give it another shot this week, but one more like last week’s and I’m out.

                    <span>Kevin Roose’s take on the inside look at Facebook revealed by The Wall Street Journal’s “Facebook Files” series, which in turn is based on Frances Haugen’s whistleblower leaks:
It’s far too early to declare Facebook dead. The company’s stock
price has risen nearly 30 percent in the past year, lifted by
strong advertising revenue and a spike in use of some products
during the pandemic. Facebook is still growing in countries
outside the United States, and could succeed there even if it
stumbles domestically. And the company has invested heavily in
newer initiatives, like augmented and virtual reality products,
that could turn the tide if they’re successful.
But Facebook’s research tells a clear story, and it’s not a happy
one. Its younger users are flocking to Snapchat and TikTok, and
its older users are posting anti-vaccine memes and arguing about
politics. Some Facebook products are actively shrinking, while
others are merely making their users angry or self-conscious.
Facebook’s declining relevance with young people shouldn’t
necessarily make its critics optimistic. History teaches us that
social networks rarely age gracefully, and that tech companies can
do a lot of damage on the way down.

                    <span>Keith Zubrow, writing for 60 Minutes Overtime:
Haugen stated that some of Facebook’s own research found that
“angry content” is more likely to receive engagement, something
that content producers and political parties are aware of.
“One of the most shocking pieces of information that I brought out
of Facebook that I think is essential to this disclosure is
political parties have been quoted, in Facebook’s own research,
saying, we know you changed how you pick out the content that goes
in the home feed,” said Haugen. “And now if we don’t publish
angry, hateful, polarizing, divisive content, crickets. We don’t
get anything. And we don’t like this. We know our constituents
don’t like this. But if we don’t do these stories, we don’t get
distributed. And so it used to be that we did very little of it,
and now we have to do a lot of it, because we have jobs to do. And
if we don’t get traffic and engagement, we’ll lose our jobs.”
Haugen’s whistleblowing jibes exactly with my theory all along: Facebook prioritizes growth and engagement over all else, and when they discovered that polarizing angering content drives engagement more than anything else, they let it fly. It’s that simple.

                    <span>Apple Newsroom:
Apple today announced Apple Watch Series 7, featuring the largest
and most advanced Apple Watch display ever — and a reengineered
Always-On Retina display with significantly more screen area and
thinner borders — will be available to order beginning Friday,
October 8, at 5 a.m. PDT and available in stores starting Friday,
October 15.
So the Series 7 watches are only shipping three weeks after the iPhones 13. Not bad, but let’s see how supply-constrained they are.
While I’m writing about Apple Watch, let me put on the record my theory about the flat-sides industrial design that a slew of rumor guys claimed was coming for Series 7, but in fact, did not. (I put forth this theory on the latest episode of The Talk Show, with guest Jason Snell.)

We want some dang goals.
 The Philadelphia Flyers march on in their preseason and tonight will be facing the Boston Bruins at home in a matchup that might mean something and might not. It’s hump day; the fourth of six warm-up games that are meaningless because we basically know who is going to be in the final lineup. Regardless, it’s something to do.
All we want to do is get together and clap our damn hands together as we mindlessly watch some dudes skate around on the ice with a puck. Can we just enjoy the Flyers scoring more goals than the other team as well?



Three Players To Watch

He’s here because it’s fun to watch him. Like, it’s always just so much fun. I don’t even care if he does anything but skate around looking…</span>

Golden Knights goaltender Robin Lehner put Alain Vigneault and the Flyers on blast with the belief that the team is distributing highly addictive drugs to its players.
 The big story from Saturday night should have been the Flyers’ 3-1 win over the Washington Capitals. However, the hockey community was buzzing after Vegas Golden Knights goaltender Robin Lehner made some pretty gargantuan accusations about the Flyers and their medical practices.
Minutes after the Flyers’ first victory of the preseason, Lehner took to Twitter to accuse the Flyers of giving benzodiazepines (benzos) and Ambien — highly addictive drugs used to treat anxiety and insomnia — to its players.
He then demanded that the Flyers fire head coach Alain Vigne…</span>

And some spooky skeletons to get October started
 Indie developers continue to push the envelope with the wild and weird worlds we get to play in. A lot of the joy of this column comes from seeing what developers create, when left to their own devices — and this week it’s a third-person shooter where you’ll take on the world, fighting as a coffee bean who barrels headfirst into James Bond-level action. 
We have dangerous coffee beans and more in Cool WIP, Polygon’s weekly roundup of eye-catching clips, and screenshots of works in progress. Each week, the Polygon staff scours the internet for the most interesting games still under construction, to give you a sampler of the coolest up-and-coming projects.

The flaming-spear-wielding Thoma also makes his debut
 Genshin Impact’s Inazuma region continues to grow with the latest update of the game. The open-world adventure will be getting its 2.2 update, Into the Perilous Labyrinth of Fog, on Oct. 13, Mihoyo announced Monday. The addition will bring the last of the islands of Inazuma, a new playable character Thoma, and a series of new challenges and minigames to Genshin Impact. 
Also, all players regardless of the platform can now claim Aloy from Horizon Zero Dawn, as long as they’re above adventure rank 20.
This update builds on the Inazuma update, which brought a new story and giant Japanese-inspired region to the game. The 2.2 update will add Tsurumi Island, a dark and foreboding island filled with more powerful monsters.

Genshin Impact is a free-to-play adventure game where players use gacha mechanics to unlock characters. In addition to introducing a new character named Thoma, this update will bring back fan-favorites like Childe and Hu Tao under new banners and will once again give players a shot at unlocking them.
As far as non-character updates go, the update will bring a new rhythm minigame as part of the Tuned to the World’s Sounds event, as well an Inazuma-themed Realm style and Furnishing Blueprints, so you can design your home based on the architectural flourishes of the region. Also, fans will now be able to use their DualSense controllers on the PC version.</span>

WoW patch 3.1.0 made him ‘realize what horrors centralized services can bring’
 Maybe take this with a grain of salt, but, the creator of Ethereum — the blockchain that spawned the NFT craze — says he was driven to create decentralized money because his World of Warcraft character was cruelly nerfed.
“I happily played World of Warcraft during 2007-2010, but one day Blizzard removed the damage component from my beloved warlock’s Siphon Life spell,” Vitalik Buterin, the programmer who developed Ethereum’s original concept in late 2013, says in a bio hosted at about.me. “I cried myself to sleep, and on that day I realized what horrors centralized services can bring. I soon decided to quit.”

Just in time for Halloween!
 Ghosts are very scary, and this is why Phasmophobia is an exciting game. Players take the role of amateur ghost hunters, plumbing the depths of suburban homes and abandoned high schools in search of specters. It looks like a new kind of ghoul is coming to the game, according to a post on Kinetic Games’ social media.
The teaser image shows two new ghost types, although their names and the specifics are blurred out. This brings the total number of ghosts in the game to 18. Previous updates have included new types like the Yokai and the Hantu, who hail from different regions around the world
What could they be? Very spooky   #Phasmophobia pic.twitter.com/rmo9mXehtL
— Phasmophobia (@KineticGame) October 4, 2021



These two new mysterious ghost friends appear to be part of the Halloween Update, which is currently listed as “In Progress” on the developer’s public Trello board. In addition, there is an upcoming Nightmare Difficulty option for particularly hardy hunters, some features that are simply marked as REDACTED, and more.
More details about Phasmophobia’s next update will be released closer to Halloween, but it looks like it’ll be a great time to pick the flashlight back up and explore what the early access title has to offer. Since launch, Kinetic Games has continued to add features to the game that help make it a mainstay on Twitch, with features like new ghosts and levels, or the ability to scare your friends by throwing things at them as a ghost after you’ve died.</span>

Hades and Rocket League will be among the first to get Epic Achievements
 The Epic Games Store is finally getting a unified achievement system. The system is called Epic Achievements, and it will be added to a few games starting next week, Epic announced Monday. 
Epic Achievements will be available first for Rocket League, Hades, Pillars of Eternity, Humankind, Zombie Army 4, Defense Grid, and a few more titles that Epic hasn’t announced yet. Other developers will get access to the tools soon, which means that even more games should be getting their official Epic Achievements before the end of the year. 
The details page of each game with Epic Achievements will display all achievements, as well as progress toward unlocking them. The achievements will also give XP that will level up Epic accounts, letting players show off their feats to their friends. The rarer — and more difficult — the achievement, the more experience it will give. Here’s a list of the achievement tiers and how much XP they can grant.
Bronze — 5-45 XP
Silver — 50-95 XP
Gold — 100-200 XP   
Platinum — 250 XP
This isn’t the first time that games on the Epic Games Store have had achievements, but it is the first time those achievements will be part of a unified system that will be tracked outside of each individual game. Thankfully, all of the developer achievements, which were exclusive to specific games before, will still be available in any game they were a part of. 
In fact, according to Epic, if a game previously had developer achievements and switches over to the new Epic Achievements, all progress will carry over right away, and you’ll get the XP you already earned.</span>

Choo-Choo Charles is a terrifying concept
 Survival horror train game Choo-Choo Charles looks like the unusual combination of Blair Witch and The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks, with a Thomas the Tank Engine-fueled nightmare for extra spice. It’s the logical conclusion of nearly a decade of Thomas the Tank Engine video game mods, only the locomotive here isn’t a stand-in for a Skyrim dragon, but a bloodthirsty, spider-legged monstrosity named Charles.
Two Star Games’ announced Choo-Choo Charles on Friday, and a viral tweet from the developer quickly illustrated the appeal of this unique horror game. Turns out no one wants to be chased by a hungry-for-human-flesh spider-train-beast, but they do want to play a video game where you can upgrade a modest train with a mounted machine gun and kill that kind of creature.
According to Choo-Choo Charles’ official description, Charles is terrifying a local village and it’s up to you to destroy him. You’ll complete missions for local townsfolk, loot for scraps to upgrade your train’s armor, mobility, and damage, and ultimately take down Charles.
While Two Star Games’ newest release seems perfect for Spooky Month, Choo-Choo Charles won’t be out until the first quarter of 2022, according to its Steam listing. In the meantime, Two Star Games has three free horror games on Steam you can try: Cloud Climber, My Friend is a Raven, and Night in Riverager.</span>

An awe-inspiring odyssey
 I don’t function well under pressure. So when my parents and teachers told me that I’m the last hope of my people, I was prepared to be pretty stressed about the next steps. Then, a couple of hours later, I’m chasing a pink light known as a brine wisp above beautiful crystal waters, doing donuts above the ocean while playing with this new life form.
Jett: The Far Shore delights in these contrasts.  
We’ve all been to space before — I personally love dabbling (and, occasionally, dying horrifically) in games like No Man’s Sky and Hardspace Shipbreaker. But while other games focus on the danger or the adventure of interstellar travel, Jett places all of its emphasis on the unsettling, awe-inspiring, and utterly alien beauty …</span>

Remedy’s Alan Wake: Remastered doesn’t add much, but it’s a great excuse to replay a classic
 Alan Wake is a frustrating masterpiece. It’s rife with charm, and overflowing with a mysterious atmosphere, and both are on display in Alan Wake: Remastered more than ever before. However, its issues are still as glaring as they were 11 years ago, and this remaster does nothing to mitigate them.
Let’s get this out of the way up front: The actual act of playing Alan Wake was already boring in 2010. By today’s standards, it’s a legitimate slog. A good 40% of certain levels consist of just jogging through the woods or down a road, and Alan can only run for about five seconds without slowing down and huffing for air — a relatable trait, from one writer …</span>

                    <span>After its first event of the fall, Apple is on track to hold a Mac focused event within the next month, where it will debut brand new MacBook Pros with a faster &quot;M1X&quot; Apple silicon chip, an updated design, and improved display technology, according to Bloomberg&#x27;s Mark Gurman.





Apple last year held its Mac event in November, but in the past, it has held Mac events in October. Till now, there&#x27;s been some unknown about whether Apple will stick with its November or October timeframe for this year. 



In his latest Power On newsletter, Gurman says the company is poised to announce M1X powered MacBook Pros within the next month, noting that &quot;Apple typically does its major new Mac introductions in October. So stay tuned.&quot; In the paywalled section of the newsletter, Gurman also reiterated what we can expect performance-wise from the new machines. 

The Apple M1X chip, the likely name for a more graphics-intense and professional-focused M1 chip, is indeed still on tap for 2021. We&#x27;ll likely see it show up first in a new range of MacBook Pros in the next month and a higher-end Mac mini at some point. The M1X has been developed in two variations: both with 10 CPU cores (eight high-performance and two high-efficiency) and either 16 or 32 graphics cores.
Previous report suggests that alongside the new MacBook Pros, Apple may also announce a redesigned Mac mini. Apple last month announced the iPhone 13, Apple Watch Series 7, a new generation iPad, and the sixth-generation iPad mini, and besides new Macs, the company is also rumored to be releasing third-generation AirPods before the end of this year.

                    <span>Amid rumors that the Apple Watch Series 7 could go on sale in just a matter of weeks, new images shared with MacRumors allegedly show the new Apple Watch in the wild, giving us our first real-world look at Apple&#x27;s latest watch.





The images were initially posted on a Facebook group for Apple Watch enthusiasts, but it has been taken down since its posting. The poster of the photos claimed that they are working for a carrier who was testing the Series 7 before it officially goes on sale &quot;later this fall.&quot;



We&#x27;ve so far only seen the Series 7 in Apple&#x27;s marketing and promotional materials, and the company has yet to announce a date for when it will be available for purchase. The images shared today offer us our first hands-on look at the Series 7 with its larger and more expansive display. Despite rumors, the Series 7 does not feature flat-edges but instead &quot;more rounded and softer corners,&quot; which allows the display to curve slightly over the sides.



The larger display is one of just a few design changes for the Series 7 compared to the previous generation. The Series 7 features an improved IP6X rating for dust and water resistance but internally maintains the same CPU as the Apple Watch Series 6.



While there certainly could be more internal changes for the Series 7, we&#x27;ll have to wait until we get our hands on the watch itself to learn about them. For a full rundown of everything we know, be sure to check out our comprehensive roundup.

Some observations for your morning. 
 They did it! After two somewhat dicey showings to start the preseason, the Flyers were back last night with just about as close to their opening night roster as you could get against the Capitals, and with a pretty strong showing, they were able to pick up their first win of the preseason. It wasn’t perfect, but it was certainly a right direction, and if nothing else, a solid start for what very well could be that opening night lineup. It’s a bit of positivity, and we’ll certainly take it.

The Flyers won their first game of the preseason with their projected opening night lineup together for the first time.
 The Philadelphia Flyers looked like, well, the Philadelphia Flyers for the first time this preseason against the Washington Capitals. 
After mixed lineups in their first two games with several AHL (or worse) players on the ice, Alain Vigneault sent out all of the Flyers’ big guns in this one. The Flyers lineup we saw tonight just might be the lineup that we see against the Vancouver Canucks on October 15th.
The Flyers were the much better team throughout the game in their 3-1 win. Claude Giroux, Cam Atkinson, and Scott Laughton lit the lamp as Martin Jones made 21 saves on 22 shots in the victory.
The two teams practiced a shootout after the…</span>

Nine Favorite Things Happy October! The start of the holiday season is officially here. Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas – they’re all coming in hot. I love this time of year, but we all know that it can be busy (and often stressful too). But I’ve told myself that I’m really going to make an effort to…

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Apple has canceled its plans to release an updated iPad Air with an OLED display next year due to concerns around quality and costs, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said today in an investor note obtained by MacRumors. 





In March, Kuo reported that Apple had an ‌iPad Air‌ with an OLED display in the pipeline for next year. Today, Kuo has revised his prediction, saying that will not be the case since Apple has canceled those plans due to costs and performance not meeting the company&#x27;s expectations. 



Kuo had previously stated that the 11-inch iPad Pro would be receiving a mini-LED display next year, and Kuo today doubled down on that claim by saying it will be the &quot;focus of [the] iPad line in 2022.&quot; Currently, only the 12.9-inch iPad Pro includes the newer mini-LED technology. One reason Kuo states that Apple had canceled its OLED ‌iPad Air‌ is that it may have been detrimental to the sales of the forthcoming 11-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ with a mini-LED display. 



While Apple plans to stick with an LCD display for the ‌iPad Air‌, Kuo says the company continues to research and develop newer display technologies for the ‌iPad‌ line. A report last week suggested that Apple and Samsung had abandoned their joint plans to develop an OLED display for a forthcoming updated 10.9-inch ‌iPad Air‌.

                    <span>The flurry of activity following Apple&#x27;s event and the launches of iOS 15 and the iPhone 13 has started to calm down, but that doesn&#x27;t mean there hasn&#x27;t continued to be a ton of news out there.





With almost two weeks out in the public, iOS 15 has proven to include a number of bugs, so some users may want to hold off on updating if they haven&#x27;t already. Apple has already pushed out one bug fix update, and a more significant update is currently in beta testing.



Other news this week included teardowns of the iPhone 13 and new iPad mini, as well some rumors about the next MacBook Air, so read on for details on all of these stories and more!

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Apple today ended a program that offered customers with possibly defective iPhone 8 models with a free repair for their logic board, which in some cases caused the device to restart and become unresponsive. 





The program officially launched in August of 2018 and targeted a &quot;very small percentage&quot; of ‌iPhone‌ 8 devices that may have had a defective logic board. According to Apple, at the time, affected models were sold between September 2017 and March 2018 in China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Macau, New Zealand, and the U.S. The ‌iPhone‌ 8 Plus was not part of the program, and Apple had previously prompted customers to its support website to check if they were eligible for a free repair.



Now, the program has officially ended, and Apple has removed it from its repair program list on its website. The program ran for more than three years, and while it has finished, customers still experiencing issues with their ‌iPhone‌ 8 should still contact Apple support as they may still be willing to help.

                    <span>Mike Isaac, Sheera Frenkel, and Ryan Mac, reporting for The New York Times:
But some of Facebook’s containment has at times backfired with
its own workers. This week, the company downplayed the internal
research that The Journal had partly based its articles on,
suggesting that the findings were limited and imprecise. That
angered some employees who had worked on the research, three
people said. They have congregated on group chats to decry the
characterizations as unfair, and some have privately threatened
to quit.
That’s what it takes for these researchers to think about quitting Facebook? Their research shows that Facebook is doing harm to society and harm to teenagers, but what makes them threaten to leave is having their work disparaged? What a magnet for sociopaths this company is.

First the basic facts!

Good things please?
 We’re back with a bit of weekend hockey on deck! After dropping their first two games of the preseason this week to the Islanders and Bruins, the Flyers are back with most of their big guns in tow and hoping to pick up a win over the Capitals tonight. They’ll be facing a Capitals team without a number of their biggest contributors, so if there was ever a time they could pull a reverse and take advantage of a bit of a talent mismatch, well, the time is now.

He may actually be the best forward on the team at this rate. 
 If it isn’t fairly apparent from even a cursory glance, Joel Farabee is a quality hockey player. 
At Broad Street Hockey, we’ve all sung his praises fairly regularly. He was ranked second in our top 25 under 25, improved on his performances substantially, and when his name was being kicked around in Seth Jones trade rumors, it was shut right down. Fortunately, the Flyers signaled their intentions by near immediately signing Farabee to a new contract.

                    <span>If you have been experiencing issues with paying off or managing your Apple Card today, you are not alone, as Apple has confirmed ongoing issues.





&quot;Some users may not be able to apply for Apple Card, pay their bill, lock/unlock their physical card, request a new or replacement physical card, or request a new card number,&quot; reads a notice posted on Apple&#x27;s system status page.



The issues began within the past few hours and affect only some cardholders. We&#x27;ll update this story when Apple indicates the issues have been resolved.




Looks like there’s issues paying #AppleCard @MacRumors @9to5mac. My payment errored twice but I received a receipt for my Apple Cash withdraw. The money is gone from my Apple Cash but hasn’t been applied to the card. Also no clue if my bank draft went through or not. What a mess. pic.twitter.com/jrm75Mubrb

                    <span>Comparing the iPhone 13 models to the iPhone 12 models makes the ‌iPhone 13‌ update seem uninspired and unnecessary, but for those who have an older iPhone, it&#x27;s a different story, especially when it comes to camera quality.

We compared the ‌iPhone 13‌ to the iPhone 11 Pro, ‌iPhone‌ 8, and ‌iPhone‌ 6, and have come to the conclusion that if you have an older model and take a lot of pictures, the ‌iPhone 13‌ is worth the upgrade. Check out our video up above and our comparison photos to see if you agree.





It will come as no surprise that the ‌iPhone 13‌ outperforms the ‌iPhone‌ 6, and this is where we see some of the starkest differences. The ‌iPhone‌ 8 is closer in quality and has a color profile that&#x27;s actua…</span>

                    <span>Apple on late Thursday seeded the first beta of Safari 15.1 for macOS Big Sur and macOS Catalina to developers for testing. Safari 15.1 beta is also included in the eighth beta of macOS Monterey seeded earlier this week.





The release notes for the Safari 15.1 beta are largely recycled from the initial release of Safari 15, but in our own testing, the beta appears to fix an issue where bookmarking a YouTube page would result in the browser crashing. Apple will likely be implementing additional bug fixes by the time Safari 15.1 is released to the public, but an issue with the browser showing old tabs upon being reopened does not appear to be fixed yet.



Safari 15.1 beta can be downloaded from the Apple Developer website on the More Downloads page when logged in. In order to install the beta, developers must be running the latest versions of macOS Big Sur or macOS Catalina, according to Apple. 



Safari 15 features redesigned tabs that have a rounder and more defined appearance, faster performance, improved security, and more. The browser will come preinstalled on macOS Monterey when the software update is released later this year, and Apple has also made the browser available for macOS Big Sur and macOS Catalina users.

                    <span>United Airlines today announced that its Travel-Ready Center is offering Apple Health app integration to make it easier for customers to share their verified vaccination records ahead of traveling.





Apple in iOS 15 added a feature that lets iPhone owners add their SMART Health Card formatted vaccination records to the Apple Health app, with those records able to be used for vaccine verification purposes. Apple also introduced new Health Record sharing features, which United is taking advantage of.



United Airlines customers who have installed ‌iOS 15‌ and who have uploaded their vaccination records to Apple Health can connect the Health app to United&#x27;s Travel-Ready Center to be instantly reviewed on United&#x27;s platform.

                    <span>Apple today released iOS 15.0.1, which is the first official update to the iOS 15 operating system that was released in September. iOS 15.0.1 comes two weeks after the launch of ‌iOS 15‌, and it is a bug fix update.





The iOS 15.0.1 update can be downloaded for free and the software is available on all eligible devices over-the-air in the Settings app. To access the new software, go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update.



Today&#x27;s update likely fixes an Apple Watch bug that has been affecting iPhone 13 users. Many ‌iPhone 13‌ owners have been unable to use the feature that&#x27;s designed to allow an iPhone to unlock with an authenticated Apple Watch when the user is wearing a mask.

                    <span>Apple CEO Tim Cook is in New York City today for a meeting with Margrethe Vestager, the European Commissioner for Competition, according to a person familiar with the matter. Vestager was a keynote speaker at Fordham University&#x27;s annual Conference on International Antitrust Law and Policy earlier today.





It&#x27;s unclear when Cook and Vestager are scheduled to meet or what topics will be on the agenda. In April, the European Commission informed Apple of its preliminary view that it abused its dominant position for the distribution of music streaming apps through the App Store by charging high commission fees on Apple Music rivals like Spotify, which had filed a complaint against Apple with the European Commission in 2019.



While in New York, Cook stopped in at Apple&#x27;s retail store in the SoHo neighborhood this morning, sharing a photo of his visit on Twitter. Cook also tweeted a photo of his visit to the International Center of Photography.




Good morning Apple SoHo! 👋 Great to feel the excitement and energy, from team members and customers alike! pic.twitter.com/frOZVgvbMa

Following his trip to New York, Cook is reportedly scheduled to speak at the Silicon Slopes Summit in Salt Lake City, Utah on October 13, and he will headline a fundraising dinner on the same day. In late August, Cook reached his 10th year as Apple CEO.

                    <span>All possible configurations of the iPhone 13 Pro and ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ Max are currently showing a 3 to 4-week, even up to a month delay in shipments in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, with in-store stock varying in availability.





At the time of writing, in the United States, every possible configuration of the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ Max, regardless of color or storage, shows a 3 to 4 week wait time for shipments, with in-store stock varying across the country. In the United Kingdom and Canada, the situation seems direr, with all configurations showing up with up to a one-month delay, also with in-store stock varying. The iPhone 13 and ‌iPhone 13‌ mini seem less affected, with expected shipment delays and availability across all stores.



Apple&#x27;s CEO Tim Cook warned during the company&#x27;s last earnings calls that industry-wide shortages could be impacting iPhone production in the coming months, added on top of increased demand for the latest iPhones. The ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ Max are likely doing well thanks to ProMotion displays and improved camera capabilities. 



Early analyst numbers suggested that pre-order demand for the new high-end iPhones was initially off to a strong start. Despite the phones having started shipping to customers one week ago, the supply continues to be dry. 



Apple&#x27;s suppliers are reportedly struggling to keep up with Apple&#x27;s high demand for the new iPhones amid the global health crisis and new energy regulation in China. Apple&#x27;s supply chain will continue to be more strained in the coming months thanks to new MacBook Pros and the imminent launch of the Apple Watch Series 7.

                    <span>Microsoft today announced that Office 2021 for Mac will be released on October 5 with many new features. The suite of Office 2021 apps available on Mac includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote, with the option for Outlook.





Office 2021 includes many of the collaboration features already available to Microsoft 365 subscribers, such as real-time co-authoring of documents and Microsoft Teams access for chatting and video calling with others. Microsoft outlined additional new features in a support document, including new inking tools, data types, functions, translation and editing tools, motion graphics, ease-of-use features, and more.



The non-subscription version of Office Home and Student 2021 is priced at $149.99 in the United States and includes access to Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote for personal use. There is also Office Home and Business 2021 for $249.99, which includes everything in Home and Student, plus Outlook and the rights to use the apps for business purposes.



The new versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, and more can also be had with a Microsoft 365 subscription, with pricing set at $6.99 per month or $69.99 per year for individuals and at $9.99 per month or $99.99 per year for families.



Office 2021 will be available on Microsoft.com and at retailers worldwide starting October 5. Microsoft said Office 2021 will be supported on the three most recent macOS releases, which presumably refers to macOS Monterey, macOS Big Sur, and macOS Catalina.

                    <span>We&#x27;re still a year away from ever seeing the iPhone 14 and not even a month since the iPhone 13. Despite that, the rumors are already floating on what Apple has planned for next year. The latest rumor suggests that for the ‌iPhone 14‌, Apple plans to include a whopping 2TB storage option. 





With the iPhone 13 Pro and ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ Max, Apple added a 1TB storage option for customers, the largest ever storage configuration offered on an iPhone. The new option was due primarily to new camera features, such as ProRes for videos launching later this year. ProRes videos, in addition to 4K 60FPS videos shot on the ‌iPhone‌, consume significantly more storage than regular videos.

Apple&#x27;s last event took place on Tuesday, September 14, but the reliable Bloomberg journalist Mark Gurman, who often reveals accurate insights into Apple&#x27;s plans, has said that the company has another event planned to take place within the next several weeks.

                    <span>The third-generation AirPods are still on track to be launched before the end of this year, despite their lack of appearance during the iPhone 13 and Apple Watch Series 7 event earlier last month, according to DigiTimes.





Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reported the weekend before Apple&#x27;s September 14 &quot;California streaming&quot; event that the third-generation ‌AirPods‌ would make an appearance during the fully digital event. While that did not happen, the new ‌AirPods‌ are rumored to already be in mass production, and Apple is seemingly gearing up to launch them before the end of the year.



The new ‌AirPods‌ will be the first significant update to the ‌AirPods‌ lineup since the AirPods Pro three years ago. The new ‌AirPods‌ are expected to feature an updated design that takes inspiration from the higher-end ‌AirPods Pro‌ but lacking in &quot;Pro&quot; features. Rumors are unclear on whether the new ‌AirPods‌ will feature silicone ear tips or not, as leaked images and renders depict both possibilities.



Apple announced its ‌AirPods Pro‌ via a press release in 2019, and besides their initial announcement on stage in 2016, ‌AirPods‌ have not yet been given dedicated airtime during an Apple event. Apple could announce the new third-generation ‌AirPods‌ via a press release in the coming weeks, or alternatively include them in its rumored second event for the fall, expected to take place later this month or in November.

                    <span>When I meditate I see white noise, When I meditate I hear the static of myself and travel into my thoughts. When I listen to Field of Fear, my mind digs deep into their fuzzed-out drone and sleeps in their shower of sonic grey noise. You don’t just listen to Field of Fear, you experience […]

Any marketing director, any talent promoter, would have looked at early Full of Hell, an anomalous mix of early emoviolence, lo-fi harsh noise, Norwegian black metal, and Canadian crust, and they would have said the band was […]

                    <span>Johfra Bosschart (1919-1998) was a Dutch surrealist who, in his own words, painted images of “psychology, religion, the Bible, astrology, antiquity, magic, witchcraft, mythology, and occultism.” So, pretty much everything I’m into, with the exception of The Bible, but I’m thinking about doing an alternative read of that, too. The earliest stages of his work were […]

                    <span>Reuters:
South Korean Internet service provider SK Broadband has sued
Netflix to pay for costs from increased network traffic and
maintenance work because of a surge of viewers to the U.S. firm’s
content, an SK spokesperson said on Friday.
The move comes after a Seoul court said Netflix should
“reasonably” give something in return to the internet service
provider for network usage, and multiple South Korean lawmakers
have spoken out against content providers who do not pay for
network usage despite generating explosive traffic.
Some really odd legal decisions and laws coming out of South Korea lately. I detect a whiff of protectionism. Would they be going after app store payment systems if the dominant one belonged to Samsung? I doubt it.

I asked Brian if I could could talk to one of those regulars. I
don’t want to make fun of them, I said. “Oh no,” he says. “We’re
making fun of them.” Brian has been ripping them all morning long
because those guys, those regulars, have tickets to the concert
tonight. “They’ll pay $400 for a ticket on the floor,” Brian says,
“but they don’t recognize Mick Jagger when he walks in the door.”

What’s new in iOS 15. Includes before and after comparisons

I’ve been using iOS 15 all summer, and there are a slew of changes illustrated here that I hadn’t noticed. (You may recall a similar collection from Burnett for iOS 12 to 13. As I wrote then, Twitter is a good medium for this sort of thing.)

                    <span>Chance Miller, writing for 9to5Mac:
As we’ve detailed in the past, it can be quite confusing when
trying to find the correct USB-C cable for your devices. Even
though the connectors all look the same, USB-C cables all meet
different standards for power delivery speeds, data transfer, and
more. Here are the highlights of the USB-IF’s announcements today:
USB-IF establishes new Certified USB Type-C Cable Logos to
display cable power capabilities in watts, clearly indicating
support for 60W or 240W as defined by the USB Power Delivery 3.1
Specification.


Certified USB4 Logos updated in parallel to unify branding
across the Certified USB Logo Program.




These beautiful, totally professionally-designed new logos will clear it all up, I’m sure. Perhaps with a little regulatory help from the product design savants on the European Commission.

It wasn’t pretty, but hey, it’s preseason!
 1. Joel Farabee is still amazing
Farabee broke out in a big way last season by leading the Flyers in goals. Last night, he picked up right where he left off scoring the only two goals of the game for the good guys. The first flashed his special talent of finding the soft spots in the defense against a very good Bruins penalty kill. JVR made a beautiful pass from the goal line to a cutting Farabee and he snapped the shot by Swayman. His instincts are arguably his greatest talent, and they were on full display on this goal. 
That JVR to Joel Farabee connection though. pic.twitter.com/Qo5AXajfav

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *The Flyers lost last night — twice, really — but the real fun came from the inaugural TNT hockey broadcast. The chaos was beautiful. But yeah, the game itself was not a pretty one for Your Boys. RECAP! 
*ANOTHER PROSPECT IS INJURED WHAT IN THE WORLD IS GOING ON HERE???!? [NBC Sports Philly]
Ahem. 
*Thankfully, this one doesn’t appear to be too too too terrible:
Zamula will be out 3 to 4 weeks.
— Bill Meltzer (@billmeltzer) September 30, 2021



*In better news, so far Derick Brassard is looking like a solid pickup. Yes, it is only preseason. Yes, it’s still good to see. [BSH]
*Given how amazing Wayne Simmonds is, it’s really, really enraging that he has had to deal with so much... bullshit. Sorry, no other word. And despite it, he’s amazing. [Sportsnet]
*Margarita Bob, still bad at retirement, has already anointed next year’s #1 overall. So that’s cool. [TSN]
*Boy, Evander Kane just refuses to be a decent human being, huh? What a shame. So much talent. [Fear The Fin]
*And finally, DGB, ever the optimist (for a Leafs’ fan), finds hope in the hopeless. [The Athletic]</span>

Just a little Glass Houses reference for you there.
 The Philadelphia Flyers and Boston Bruins allegedly played tonight, although it was hard to tell behind a deluge of hilarious technical difficulties via NHL on TNT. To be honest, being largely unable to see what was happening on the screen might have been to fans’ benefit. What did we learn, who stood out, and what were the funniest live production gaffes of the night? Let’s dive in.
What went right?
Joel Farabee looked like his usually dazzling self, scoring two beautiful goals on the power play.
Let’s back on track in the second period.

Publisher says it ‘reflects our new Purpose,’ yes, with a capital P
 Bandai Namco is messing with its branding again. Don’t worry, it’s not changing back to Namco Bandai. No, it’s just ditching its logo (Orange 021 C and good ol’ Process Yellow making a rich Pantone 185 C) in favor of an anodyne word-balloon wordmark.
In a statement, the company said the outgoing logo “expresses the fusion of Bandai and Namco that was created when the two companies integrated,” although not necessarily in that order, back in 2006. “It will be replaced with a new logo that reflects our new Purpose.”
Sooooo … what is that new purpose? If you had “Fun for All into the Future,” on your bingo card, come to the desk for your prize. “Bandai Namco exists to share dreams, fun, and inspiration with people around the world,” the company said in the same statement.
Image: Bandai Namco Entertainment
  
“Connecting people and societies in the enjoyment of uniquely entertaining products and services, we’re working to create a brighter future for everyone,” says the Purpose. That’s putting a lot on Goku’s shoulders, but he’ll manage.
So, anyway, it’s now Bandai Namco inside a word balloon, taking effect in April 2022. As to that, Bandai Namco says the balloon is an homage to “Japan’s manga culture that has become so popular everywhere.” And Bandai Namco is a big stakeholder in that culture, with Dragon Ball, Gundam, Naruto, and several other anime and manga franchises in its stable.
Still, some fans seem not to be diggin’ it. Kotaku on Friday morning pointed out that users on 2ch, Japan’s largest bulletin board, were throwing shade on Bandai Namco’s new look:
“Looks like Twitch’s logo,” says one (speaking for me, too). “And the orange logo was so nice,” said another. And, speaking for most of us, “It’s fine. I don’t really care about logos.”</span>

BULLSHIT [Cranks up the volume on metal music]
 At first, Jack, the protagonist from Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin, didn’t seem all that notable. He was just the dude who wore a plain black shirt in one of the most fashionable and eye-catching franchises in the history of JRPGs. However, the man continues to make a name for himself, and not just for his fashion choices. Gameplay from a new demo for Stranger of Paradise shows an absurd, extremely emo scene: Jack says “Bullshit” and blasts metal music in his wireless earbuds, before strutting out of the castle.

Fans told to expect a big post-launch roadmap, but not for fixing a mess like this
 Well, Pro Evolution Soccer’s transition to fully free-to-play eFootball is quite the hot mess.
Konami’s futbol game launched on Wednesday with player expectations already set into the future, thanks to a development roadmap promising a lot of core features coming via title updates. But that doesn’t even begin to account for the cavalcade of jank players have encountered — particularly PC players, who have made it the worst-rated Steam game of all time, according to one site’s metric.
What exactly is going on? Well, this:

I still have so many questions
 Every single morning, Deathloop’s protagonist Colt Vahn wakes up on a beach, surrounded by empty beer bottles. He’s reliving the same day over and over, along with all of the other residents of the Isle of Blackreef. He wants to break the time loop, but a mysterious woman named Julianna won’t let him. Julianna and Colt spend the game trading bullets and quips with each other. Their chemistry was my favorite part of the game — that is, until Deathloop’s ending left me cold.
Now that I’ve beaten the game and seen all of the possible endings, I wish I hadn’t. I miss the version of myself who was 90% of the way through the story, still intrigued by the possibilities and mysteries yet to unfold. Becau…</span>

Square Enix’s Dungeon Encounters features a fat cat and a pup with a sword in its mouth
 On Friday, Square Enix revealed Dungeon Encounters, a new dungeon crawler led by Final Fantasy veteran Hiroyuki Ito, the director of Final Fantasy 6, Final Fantasy 9, and Final Fantasy 12, and the creator of the franchise’s classic Active Time Battle system. To describe Ito’s new game as minimalist might be underselling it; players appear to walk through grid-based labyrinths, are rewarded for mapping them out, and occasionally fall into menu-based battles against monsters. Dungeon Encounters’ first trailer is perplexing and perhaps a bit distressing for fans of Ito’s past work — but I remain hopeful.
In addition to Ito, Final Fantasy 12: The Zodiac Age producer Hiroaki Kato — who also worked on Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together and two Final Fantasy Tactics games for Square Enix — is also working on the game. Musical director Nobuo Uematsu is “overseeing” the soundtrack, and Dungeon Encounters features character art from designer Ryoma Ito, whose talents are on display here.

While it appears we’ll see many of the game’s characters in 2D static artwork form, there is a big fat cat named Sir Cat and a dachshund with a sword in its mouth named Jufren, and I already want to spend time with them.
Beyond that, Square Enix promises “100 levels of thought-provoking challenges,” so I’m approaching Dungeon Encounters from the angle of “this looks like a good puzzle game, not something with an actual budget” and hoping for the best.
Dungeon Encounters will be available digitally for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Windows PC via Steam on Oct. 14. The game will cost $29.99, but is currently discounted to $23.99 for pre-orders.</span>

Amazon doesn’t quite capture the magic of an MMO
 New World promises a lush and strange continent for players to explore and conquer, full with dangerous enemies and the promise of glory and treasure. It’s a modern MMORPG in every way — absolutely gorgeous, surprisingly stable for launch, and well voice-acted. There’s also an extensive network of constant player communication. While the queues are piling up, and players are trying to join the same server as all of their friends, once I get online I enjoy a smooth ride through developer Amazon&#x27;s world of adventure.
New World feels like the first MMO designed without World of Warcraft’s DNA as a core feature. It’s not concerned with killing Blizzard’s goliath, but rather, content to be something of its own…</span>

How the game tries to lure long-time fans of the franchise
 Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin, the new action game from Koei Tecmo’s Team Ninja and Square Enix, immediately feels different from its Final Fantasy predecessors. Just one hour into the game, I found myself clawing through a magical forest as its protagonist, the manly-man Jack, slew a beautiful griffin by grabbing it by the head and then body-slamming it to the ground with a well-timed finisher. As the beast died, blood-colored crystals burst from its body, and then the creature evaporated into thin air. A Final Fantasy game has never felt so brutal. 
This high-difficulty Souls-like spinoff will be a “bold new vision” for the Final Fantasy franchise, according to producer Jin Fujiwara, and o…</span>

                    <span>Over at Print, R.E. Hawley writes about a book cover design trend you may have noticed: Behold, the Book Blob.
This design trend, well into its third or fourth year in the major publishing houses, has attracted plenty of nicknames and attendant discourse online — culture critic Jeva Lange calls it “blobs of suggestive colors,” while writer Alana Pockros calls it the “unicorn frappuccino cover,” and New Yorker writer Kyle Chayka once referred to it on Twitter as “the Zombie Formalism of book covers.”


I hadn’t really noticed this, but only because I thought these were all mostly the same book. Eep.

                    <span>Every few days, Nenet reindeer herders in the Siberian Arctic break camp and erect their tents (called chums) in a new location. This video documents how they do it.
The Nenet reindeer herders need to move their tent every few days throughout most of the year. Every time they migrate they must pack the whole tent away, drag it across the tundra on sledges, and erect it again in a fresh place, sometimes in temperatures of minus thirty degrees. Survival depends on working together as a team.
After staying in the wooded taiga for two months they start to migrate north following the ancient paths of migrating reindeer (caribou). In four months they will travel up to 1200km and must pack and move every three to five days to keep up with their herd. They must reach their summer quarters before the snows melt and flood great rivers with icy waters too cold and deep for the calves, born along the way, to cross.

                    <span>Colossal has a selection of photos of predatory birds taken by Mark Harvey — prints are available in his shop.
Shot with his signature style that applies a hearty dose of drama to the already striking creatures, the photos are shot one at a time in a slow, medium format. “Lighting is a key aspect of my work to help draw out fresh views of well-known subjects, and these birds are no exception, set within an intricate lighting setup to ultimately show the birds in a new light,” Harvey shares. “With their wings spread wide, these top avian predators’ beauty is put on full display.”

                    <span>The Apple Watch Series 7 will ship in mid-October with pre-orders to begin &quot;as early as next week,&quot; claims leaker Jon Prosser, citing sources &quot;familiar with the release.&quot;





Apple introduced the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ at its September &quot;California Streaming&quot; event alongside the iPhone 13 models, but at the time, said the new Apple Watch would ship later in the fall.



There has been no official word on when the Series 7 will be available, but most Apple Watch Series 6 models have been sold out in the United States for a couple of weeks now. Rumors suggest the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ was delayed because of manufacturing issues caused by the complexity of the device, which pushed back mass production.

                    <span>Apple today seeded a macOS Big Sur 11.6.1 beta to developers for testing purposes, with the update coming two weeks after the launch of macOS Big Sur 11.6.





Registered developers can download the beta through the Apple Developer Center and once the appropriate profile is installed, betas will be available through the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences.



According to Apple&#x27;s release notes, the update &quot;improves the security of macOS.&quot; It&#x27;s not clear why it&#x27;s being released as a beta rather than to all users, but there&#x27;s also a developer beta of a security update available for macOS Catalina as well.

                    <span>Apple is offering customers in India free AirPods with the purchase of an iPhone 12 or an iPhone 12 mini in celebration of the upcoming Diwali festival, which starts on November 4.





Apple&#x27;s promotion will kick off on Thursday, October 7, and last year, it was highly popular with supplies selling out in just a couple of hours. According to Apple, the deal will be available from October 7 to November 4, though it&#x27;s not clear how long supplies will hold up this year.



There is limited stock available on a per model basis, and Apple says that the promotion will only be available while stock lasts, so those in India hoping to take advantage of the deal should order early on October 7.



Customers in India can get the standard AirPods with Charging Case free with the promotion savings of INR 14900, or can pay extra to upgrade to the ‌AirPods‌ with Wireless Charging Case or the AirPods Pro. Pricing on the ‌iPhone 12‌ starts at INR 59900, but monthly payments are available, as are discounts with older device trade-ins.

                    <span>All four iPhone 13 models still ship with EarPods in the box in France due to a law in the country that requires all smartphones to include a &quot;hands-free kit&quot; in order to protect children under 14 years of age from potential electromagnetic radiation.

Apple&#x27;s website in France confirms the inclusion of EarPods with a Lightning connector with all iPhone 13 models sold in the country, as was the case with iPhone 12 models. To accommodate this, Apple ships the iPhones in two boxes in France, with the standard iPhone box placed inside a larger white box that contains the EarPods.  



Starting in October 2020, Apple stopped including EarPods and a charger in the box with all new iPhones that it sells. The company said omitting these accessories helps to reduce carbon emissions and avoids the mining and use of rare-earth elements. Apple added that many customers have switched to wireless headphones like AirPods. Outside of France, all new iPhones only include a Lightning to USB-C cable in the box.



Apple continues to sell EarPods separately, with pricing set at $19 in the United States.

                    <span>Apple today updated its list of vintage and obsolete products to add the 38mm and 42mm Apple Watch models to the vintage list, marking the first time that the Apple Watch has been included.





The first Apple Watch was introduced more than six years ago in April 2015, with the &quot;Series 1&quot; replacement and Series 2 upgrade following in 2016. Apple has continued on updating the Apple Watch each year, and in 2021, we&#x27;re expecting the Apple Watch Series 7 to see a release sometime in October.



The original 2015 Apple Watch now qualifies for Apple&#x27;s &quot;vintage&quot; list, which includes devices that Apple stopped distributing for sale more than five years ago and less than seven years ago.



For most products, the vintage designation means that they&#x27;re no longer eligible for repairs at the Genius Bar in Apple retail stores or from Apple Authorized Service Providers, but Apple does offer extended repairs of some vintage products and in locations where extended repairs are required by law.



In another couple of years, the original Apple Watch will move on to the obsolete list and hardware service will be entirely discontinued.

                    <span>Apple today released a new update for Safari Technology Preview, the experimental browser Apple first introduced in March 2016. Apple designed the ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ to test features that may be introduced into future release versions of Safari.





‌Safari Technology Preview‌ release 133 includes bug fixes and performance improvements for CSS, CSS Cascade Layers, CSS Font Loading API, Accessibility, JavaScript, Web API, WebRTC, Media, WebGL, and Web and App Extensions.



The current ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ release is built on the new Safari 15 update included in macOS Monterey, and as such, it includes several Safari 15 features. There&#x27;s a new streamlined tab bar with support for Tab Groups to organize tabs, along with improved support for Safari Web Extensions.

                    <span>Alongside the new iPhone 13 models, Apple introduced an updated version of the MagSafe Wallet that has Find My built in. The new MagSafe Wallet is designed to be easier to find should it slip off of an iPhone or fall out of a pocket, but some new ‌MagSafe‌ Wallet owners are unable to get ‌Find My‌ to connect.





According to a long thread on Reddit, affected users do not get the proper ‌Find My‌ pop up when attaching a ‌MagSafe‌ Wallet to an ‌iPhone‌. The issue seems to be impacting ‌iPhone 13‌ models in particular, but there are also some complaints from iPhone 12 owners.

                    <span>iOS 15 adoption has reached an estimated 19.3% since the software update was released September 20, according to mobile analytics company Mixpanel.





Mixpanel measures iOS adoption based on visits to websites and apps that use its mobile analytics SDKs, so the data is not official. Apple has yet to share iOS 15 adoption stats, having last reported an 85% adoption rate for iOS 14 back in June.



iOS 15 adoption appears to remain slower than iOS 14 adoption so far, and there are likely several reasons for that, including Apple providing iOS 14 users with the option to continue receiving important security updates, several iOS 15 features being delayed, and iOS 15 suffering from a handful of early bugs that still need to be fixed.



For example, Apple said an issue preventing some iPhone 13 users from using the Unlock with Apple Watch feature will be fixed in an upcoming software update. The feature is designed to let you unlock your iPhone while wearing a mask, but some users have encountered an &quot;Unable to Communicate with Apple Watch&quot; error message.



There&#x27;s another iOS 15 bug where performing an iCloud Backup can result in photos saved from an iMessage conversation that is later deleted to disappear from the Photos app, intermittent touchscreen issues on iPhone 13 models, and other problems.



Apple is currently beta testing iOS 15.1, which includes a fix for the Unlock with Apple Watch bug at a minimum, but there is no timeframe for the software update&#x27;s release. It&#x27;s quite possible that Apple will opt to release a smaller update such as iOS 15.0.1 to more quickly address some of the bugs and security vulnerabilities that have surfaced.

                    <span>Adding to the list of issues facing iOS 15 and iPhone 13 users, a new, seemingly widespread bug is causing CarPlay to suddenly crash whenever a user attempts to play music, such as through Apple Music or third-party providers like Spotify. 





Dozens of posts on Apple Support [1],[2],[3],[4],[5],[6], the MacRumors Forums [1],[2],[3],[4], and Twitter include users complaining that only on their new ‌iPhone 13‌ does ‌CarPlay‌ not work correctly. According to users, attempting to play music from any ‌CarPlay‌ app causes the system to crash, but it works just fine when they try on older iPhones. As one MacRumors reader chronicles:

Updated my iPhone 11 to iOS 15, drove to store with no issues with Carplay. While there, I activated my new iPhone 13 mini (and disabled the 11) and now C…</span>

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Apple now lets users rate and review pre-installed iPhone apps on the App Store, such as Maps, Podcasts, Mail, and others, bringing the company&#x27;s apps to parity with how users criticize and/or laud third-party apps on the platform.





Spotted first by 9to5Mac, Apple now lets users leave a zero to five-star rating for a number of its pre-installed apps, further enabling users to write their reviews. At the time of writing, the Podcasts app, which has faced a flurry of criticism, has a 2 out of 5-star rating out of 156 reviews, with other Apple apps varying.



Presently, no Apple app has a perfect five-star rating, with even the company&#x27;s built-in Stocks app struggling to reach a 4 out of 5 grade. Notes has earned just 3.6 out of 5, while even Maps, which has received more attention from Apple over the years, has only a 3 out of 5 ratings.



By opening up its apps to ratings and reviews, Apple and its teams are now better able to receive more direct feedback for individual apps on ‌‌iPhone‌‌ and iPad. In light of recent ‌App Store‌ litigation, this move also nixes a potential criticism from Apple&#x27;s detractors, who could have previously argued that by withholding ratings and reviews for pre-installed apps, Apple was being anti-competitive.



Apple&#x27;s pre-installed apps, such as Mail, Podcasts, and Maps, don&#x27;t receive regular ‌App Store‌ feature updates as other apps do; instead, their major updates are bundled with significant iOS releases.



Apple refines and tweaks all of its apps with each minor update for iOS and iPadOS, but significant changes, such as the ones that are likely to be requested through ratings and reviews, are not expected to come sporadically throughout the year, but instead, users will have to wait for the next major iOS release to see if their wishes have come true.

                    <span>Researchers in the U.K. have demonstrated how large unauthorized contactless payments can be made on locked iPhones by exploiting Apple Pay&#x27;s Express Transit feature when set up with Visa.





Express Transit is an ‌Apple Pay‌ feature that allows for tap-and-go payment at ticket barriers, eliminating the need to authenticate with Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode. The device does not need to be wakened or unlocked to use Express Transit.



Computer Science researchers from Birmingham and Surrey Universities demonstrated to the BBC how the attack works by exploiting a weakness in the Visa contactless system through the use of a small piece of commercially available radio equipment, which is placed near the phone and masquerades as a ticket barrier.

                    <span>Joerggum is a German artist who creates striking portraits of rubber, PVC, and leather-clad dominant women in a BDSM context. The women in his works are drawn in soft, almost dreamlike lines but the page exudes their power and demands you to kneel before them. Nuns caressing breathing tubes, strap-wielding headmistresses, and vinyl-gloved nurses all look […]

                    <span>Nintendo:
A news report on Sept. 30, 2021 (JST) falsely claims that Nintendo
is supplying tools to drive game development for a Nintendo Switch
with 4K support. To ensure correct understanding among our
investors and customers, we want to clarify that this report is
not true.
We also want to restate that, as we announced in July, we have no
plans for any new model other than Nintendo Switch — OLED Model,
which will launch on October 8, 2021.
What news report? This news report, from Bloomberg reporters Takashi Mochizuki and Olga Kharif. Quite the strident denial. It’s certainly possible Nintendo is lying here, or stretching the truth to the point of absurdity (like, say, if they supplied 4K Switch development tools in the past, but are not “supplying” them now).
We should know the answer soon — if Bloomberg’s report is simply wrong, I’m sure they’ll promptly issue a correction and retraction.
(“Big Hack” snark aside, here’s a theory that adds up: third-party developers are working on games for a 4K-capable Nintendo gaming console, which console is probably Switch-like and will play Switch games, including updated 4K versions of existing Switch games, but that new console (a) is not imminent, and Nintendo doesn’t want to Osborne the actually imminent Switch OLED in the meantime, and (b) will not be called a “Switch”.)

This is a very fresh release with iconic Agathocles and new blood from Singapore – Heraclides. The tape is damn short but interesting and cheerful. Belgian mince veterans start this split with damn raw song. Guys used only two songs for this work… and I don&#x60;t really know what to say about it, because I&#x60;ve talked about this band so many times, haha. So the sound is freaking raw, the first track “Piss On Flemish Myths ” is aggressive and nice, nothing outstanding, …</span>

More preseason hockey for your enjoyment.
 After a messy, drawn-out debut Tuesday, the Flyers are set to take on the Boston Bruins in another exhibition game. Want to know the story-lines and players to watch, or just looking to scratch your hockey itch? You’re in the right place.



The Bruins
Boston hasn’t iced many members of its main roster yet, opting to use Tuesday’s outing against the New York Rangers as a chance to break in some youngsters. In a 3-2 loss, the Bruins only featured four NHL regulars in their lineup (Tomas Nosek, Curtis Lazar, Mike Reilly, and Linus Ullmark) and still hung tough with a Rangers team playing significantly more of their established names (Artemi Panarin, Kappo Kakko, Jacob Trouba, Igor Shesterkin).

The Flyers signed Derick Brassard late in the offseason, but he could become a key addition with Kevin Hayes out.
 When the Flyers signed Derick Brassard just over a month ago, he was viewed as nothing more than a depth piece. Perhaps a safety net in the bottom six. Now, after the injury to Kevin Hayes (and less so Wade Allison), Brassard is looking more and more like a necessary signing.
The 34-year-old forward had the best years of his career with the New York Rangers under Alain Vigneault. From 2013 to 2016, Brassard missed just five regular-season games. He recorded 163 points (64 goals, 99 assists) in 241 games for the Blueshirts. In recent years, Brassard has become more of a defensive-minded center with his play-driving taking a dip.

Entering open beta on Oct. 5
 World of Warcraft Classic was a return to a simpler time, without the bells and whistles of the modern retail game. But time kept marching onwards, and Classic has proven popular enough to lead to the game’s first expansion, Burning Crusade, to have its own Classic iteration. Now Blizzard is returning to Classic with Season of Mastery, a fresh start to the throwback style that begins its open beta on Oct. 5.
Season of Mastery will have some changes to the World of Warcraft Classic experience, which Blizzard has detailed in a blog post on its official site. The six content release phases will remain, but they’ll unlock much faster, with the full cycle completing within 12 months.

Deathloop has no sense of morality, and that makes it fun
 I didn’t expect to like Deathloop. Don’t get me wrong, I loved its vibe from the moment I saw the first trailer. A ’60s murder thriller with classic spy vibes? What isn’t there to like? But knowing Deathloop was an Arkane joint had me skeptical — I’ve always enjoyed Arkane’s worlds, but seldom the way the studio marries gameplay and story. Still, hearing it was one of the best games of the year, I dove in feet first. And I found a playground that finally let me engage in my preferred playstyle without mucking up the story.
Deathloop’s world is inherently chaotic. Using Colt’s own vernacular, he’s on Blackreef to fuck shit up and he doesn’t care who gets hurt in the proc…</span>

Train your Grey Knights, kick Chaos butt
 Warhammer 40k is a rich setting with tons of bad guys to punch, and many of the games that exist in the setting let you do so with aplomb. The upcoming Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters takes a different, more tactical approach to things. In Chaos Gate, players take the role of the Space Marine chapter known as the Grey Knights, and take the fight to Chaos in an X-Com style game.
The Grey Knights are a mysterious Space Marine chapter; while games like Space Marine focus on the Ultramarines, who take the front lines, the Grey Knights are more about the mystical and faith-based sides of the Imperium. In battling back Chaos Space Marines and a mysterious disease known as the Bloom, the Grey Knights will need to update their base of operations, build new facilities, run research projects, and head into combat missions. 
Once Grey Knights are in the field, players will need to upgrade them into classes. There are four classes, and players can customize their armor and facial options to create their own special squad. Chaos Space Marines evolve as well, which escalates combat and forces players to focus on strategy.
The narrative is written by Black Library author Aaron Dembski-Bowden, so this should have some interesting lore for Warhammer fans.
Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters is currently planned to release on PC in 2022.</span>

A ‘no spoilers’ explanation of why you must play this masterpiece
 The introduction to Outer Wilds: Echoes of the Eye is Hall of Fame worthy, so comically hidden that players could complete the entirety of Outer Wilds without knowing they’d missed the entirety of its expansion. Once found, the reveal is unforgettable and worth the hour or more of head scratching required to find the proverbial front door. Its creators apparently agree; they managed to conceal the entirety of what the DLC is from its marketing campaign. I admire that choice while wondering if the ambiguity’s been detrimental to calling attention to this gem in an already crowded market.

 A new season is coming to both Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and Warzone. Season 6 is scheduled to start on Oct. 7, and the update brings some interesting changes to Verdansk, introduces new characters, and rolls out a host of other changes. Verdansk is getting blown apart in the course of the story, opening new tactical options for players hunting down their foes.
In a blog post on the official Activision site, the developer entails some changes that players can expect in the new season. The first set of changes are detailed for Warzone, and are as follows:

Die-cast visuals and strong racing action bring back great memories of a living room grand prix
 A thumbprint stamped across the hazy driver’s side window of my 1985 Audi Sport Quattro, at the end of a race, says it all. In the impressively detailed and altogether delightful Hot Wheels Unleashed, launching Thursday, the cars feel like toys that actually have been played with, and like I’m the one doing the playing.
Previous Hot Wheels games (Unleashed is the 27th, by my count) have generally presented player and car at equivalent scale, through shrinking the viewer’s perspective into their world or making one of them life-size to ours.

Capcom also briefly mentioned some new monsters coming to Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak
 Capcom hosted a Monster Hunter stream on Thursday to offer a few new details on Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak — the upcoming expansion revealed during last week’s Nintendo Direct — and details around Rise’s long-awaited PC debut on Jan. 12, 2022.
Monster Hunter Rise is finally coming to PC after nearly a year of Switch exclusivity. The PC version will feature all of the patch content and monsters, but with 4K support, high-res textures, higher framerates, and optimized keyboard and mouse controls. It also supports ultra-wide displays. Players can download a demo for the PC version on Oct. 13.
In terms of Sunbreak, Capcom revealed that Malzeno is the new elder dragon and flagship monster who appears heavily in the expansion’s trailer. There is also a new castle ruins location — which also features in the reveal — where the sky turns red. Shogun Ceanataur is also coming to Sunbreak, a returning monster that first appeared in Monster Hunter 2. Those are the only two monster Capcom was able to talk about on Thursday’s stream, but the studio revealed that more old monsters will return with Sunbreak’s release next summer.</span>

Rumored remaster to include GTA 3, Vice City, and San Andreas for modern platforms
 A new rating for Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition appears to verify reports that a remaster of the original PlayStation 2 and Xbox-era trilogy is coming to modern platforms. 
Korea’s Game Rating and Administration Committee, generally a reputable indicator of releases, recently published a rating for Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition for unspecified platforms from publisher Take-Two Interactive. Take-Two has not announced the Definitive Edition release, but the publisher said in August that it has three “new iterations of previously released titles,” which it describes as “ports and remastered titles,” in its pipeline.
A remaster of the trilogy — Grand Theft Auto 3, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas — has long been rumored. A report from Kotaku in August, citing sources, said that the three games are being remastered in Unreal Engine with a mix of new and old graphics, as well as an updated (but still classic) user interface.
A Rockstar Games spokesperson did not provide comment on the rating when contacted by Polygon.
Rockstar Games already publishes those Grand Theft Auto games under the title Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy for other platforms, according to listings on the PlayStation Store for PlayStation 4 and Steam for Windows PC.</span>

More than a few shadows hang over this faithful remaster
 With Diablo 2: Resurrected, developer Vicarious Visions had the unenviable task of releasing a game published by Activision Blizzard. 
Beginning in July,  a storm of controversy has raged around the publisher, which has faced several lawsuits alleging toxic workplace environments, a “pervasive frat boy culture,” and discrimination against women, one of which was instituted by a federal agency and ended with a recent settlement. Vicarious Visions released its creation into an environment engulfed in cynicism and anger at its affiliate publisher, and the creator of the original game. Longtime players have stopped participating in the Activision Blizzard ecosystem; high ranking employees have lef…</span>

                    <span>This video highlights one of the ways in which the Netherlands makes their streets safer for pedestrians: continuous sidewalks. Instead of sidewalks ending at the curb and picking up on the other side of the street, many sidewalks in Dutch cities continue across roadways, at the same height and using different surface materials, forcing cars to slow and signaling to drivers to be alert for pedestrians.
It’s hard to describe how much nicer it is to walk in an environment like this. It feels like the people walking are in control and that drivers are a guest in their environment, not the other way around.

                    <span>HERMITS are tiny experimental robots developed by researchers at MIT’s Media Lab that can move between different “shells” to gain new capabilities.
Inspired by hermit crabs, we designed a modular system for table-top wheeled robots to dock to passive attachment modules, defined as “mechanical shells.” Different types of mechanical shells can uniquely extend and convert the motion of robots with embedded mechanisms, so that, as a whole architecture, the system can offer a variety of interactive functionality by self-reconfiguration.

                    <span>Ed Yong: We’re Already Barreling Toward the Next Pandemic. The US is throwing too little money at high-tech, ultimately private sector solutions but much of the problem comes down to our underfunded public health system and “profoundly unequal society”.
“To be ready for the next pandemic, we need to make sure that there’s an even footing in our societal structures,” Seema Mohapatra, a health-law expert at Indiana University, told me. That vision of preparedness is closer to what 19th-century thinkers lobbied for, and what the 20th century swept aside. It means shifting the spotlight away from pathogens themselves and onto the living and working conditions that allow pathogens to flourish. It means measuring preparedness not just in terms of syringes, sequencers, and supply chains but also in terms of paid sick leave, safe public housing, eviction moratoriums, decarceration, food assistance, and universal health care. It means accompanying mandates for social distancing and the like with financial assistance for those who might lose work, or free accommodation where exposed people can quarantine from their family. It means rebuilding the health policies that Reagan began shredding in the 1980s and that later administrations further frayed. It means restoring trust in government and community through public services. “It’s very hard to achieve effective containment when the people you’re working with don’t think you care about them,” Arrianna Marie Planey, a medical geographer at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, told me.

                    <span>In 1976, Santos “Frenchie” Ramos opened a gym in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Every day of his life from that point forward was dedicated to that gym and to his members. In the gym’s 43-year history, Frenchie only missed two weeks of work; now that’s dedication.

                    <span>With the recent release of iOS 15, Apple appears to have made some changes to Siri functionality that have removed features relied on by low vision and blind iPhone users.





Several ‌Siri‌ commands that provide details on phone calls, voicemails, and sending emails no longer appear to be working. The following commands used to be functional, but have recently been removed.



 	
Do I have any voicemails?


 	
Play my voicemail messages


 	
Check my call history


 	
Check my recent calls


 	
Who called me?


 	
Send an email


 	
Send an email to [person]




Over the last two weeks, we&#x27;ve received several emails from ‌iPhone‌ users who are missing this key ‌Siri‌ functionality, or their relatives who are attempting to help them navigate the changes. The ‌Sir…</span>

                    <span>A serious bug in the iOS 15 Messages app can cause some saved photos to be deleted, according to multiple complaints we&#x27;ve heard from MacRumors readers and Twitter users.





If you save a photo from a Messages thread and then go on to delete that thread, the next time an iCloud Backup is performed, the photo will disappear.



Even though the image is saved to your personal iCloud Photo Library, it appears to still be linked to the Messages app in ‌iOS 15‌, and saving it does not persist through the deletion of the thread and an ‌iCloud‌ backup.



To replicate this bug, the following steps must be taken:



 	
Save a photo from a Messages conversation to your Camera Roll.


 	
Check to see that the photo has been saved.

                    <span>iFixit today tore apart one of Apple&#x27;s new iPad mini models, and in the process of the teardown, the repair site gave a detailed overview of why the new tablets are displaying an issue that has been dubbed &quot;jelly scrolling.&quot;






Some new iPad mini 6 owners have noticed that text or images on one side of the screen appear to be tilted downward when scrolling through content, which affects all LCD screens but is particularly noticeable on the ‌iPad mini‌.



According to iFixit, jelly scrolling usually isn&#x27;t as prominent as it is on Apple&#x27;s new 8.3-inch tablet, and it&#x27;s caused by the way the screen refreshes. The screen refreshes from one side to another, in a wave-like pattern, rather than all at once. On the ‌iPad mini‌, iFixit speculates that the direction the screen is scanni…</span>

                    <span>iOS 15 was released last week with a long list of new features, but there is one change that is proving to be an annoyance to users.





On the Apple TV, users who prefer not to input text using the Siri Remote can use a nearby iPhone or iPad to type. Whenever a text field appears on the Apple TV, a notification appears on the iPhone or iPad, and after tapping the notification, users can use the on-screen keyboard on the iPhone or iPad to enter text on the Apple TV.



The issue is that iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 no longer offer a way to disable the Apple TV keyboard notifications, despite Apple advertising this option in its tvOS 15 User Guide. On devices running iOS 14 and iPadOS 14, there was a toggle switch for turning off the notifications in Settings &gt; Notifications &gt; Apple TV Keyboard.



The inability to turn off the Apple TV keyboard notifications has prompted complaints from users. We&#x27;ve reached out to Apple to see if the company will consider reintroducing the toggle switch in a future software update, and we&#x27;ll update this story if we hear back.

                    <span>Apple today seeded a new public beta of the macOS 12 Monterey beta to public beta testers, allowing non-developers to test the new macOS Monterey software ahead of its public release. The update comes just a few day after Apple provided the eighth beta to developers. 





Public beta testers can download the macOS 12 Monterey update from the Software Update section of the System Preferences app after installing the proper profile from Apple&#x27;s beta software website.



‌macOS Monterey‌ introduces quite a few major updates for the macOS operating system. When released, Universal Control will let a single mouse, trackpad, and keyboard be used across multiple Mac or iPad devices, and it&#x27;s now possible to AirPlay directly to a Mac from an iPhone, ‌iPad‌, or even another Mac.

                    <span>Apple today seeded the second public betas of upcoming iOS 15.1 and iPadOS 15.1 betas, one week after seeding the first betas and a little over a week after releasing iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 to the public.





Public beta testers who have signed up for Apple&#x27;s beta testing program can download the iOS and ‌iPadOS 15.1‌ updates over the air after installing the proper certificate from the Public Beta website.



SharePlay makes a return in iOS 15.1, with Apple once again testing the feature that was removed before the launch of iOS 15. SharePlay is designed to let users call their friends and family and interact by watching movies, watching TV, or listening to music together.

                    <span>Despite not being advertised by Apple, the iPhone 13 Pro Max is capable of faster charging at up to 27W speeds when connected to a 30W or higher USB-C power adapter, according to testing conducted by ChargerLAB. For comparison, the iPhone 12 Pro Max is capable of charging at up to around 21W to 22W speeds with an equivalent power adapter.





It&#x27;s worth noting that the iPhone 13 Pro Max does not sustain peak 27W power for the entire charging cycle due to heat considerations, but the device should still charge slightly faster than the iPhone 12 Pro Max overall.






It&#x27;s unclear if the smaller iPhone 13 Pro is also capable of charging at up to 27W speeds — we&#x27;ve asked ChargerLAB and we&#x27;ll update this story if we hear back. The standard iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini are limited to roughly the same charging speeds as the equivalent iPhone 12 models, according to a user on Chinese social media platform Weibo.



Apple no longer includes a charger in the box with new iPhones, but it does sell a 30W USB-C power adapter for $49 for users who want to charge their iPhone 13 Pro Max as quickly as possible in light of this discovery.



Update: ChargerLAB has informed MacRumors that the smaller iPhone 13 Pro achieved max charging speeds of 23W in its testing.

                    <span>Facebook today announced that it&#x27;s bringing Reels, its short-form videos that were previously only available on the Instagram platform, to its main Facebook app on iOS and Android in the United States. 





While the two share the same name and style, Reels content on Instagram and Facebook will differ. Facebook says it is testing the ability for Instagram Reels content creators to share their Reels to the Facebook audience, but doing so is entirely in a creator&#x27;s control. Reels on Facebook can consist of effects, text, music, and more. Facebook&#x27;s concept of Reels is wholly inspired by TikTok and follows its lead in featuring short, &quot;entertaining,&quot; and trend-making videos. 
With the ability to create reels and have their Instagram reels suggested to people on Facebook, creators — whether they’re just starting out or already have a large following — will have more ways to express themselves, grow their communities and reach new audiences.



Reels on Facebook can consist of music, audio, effects, and more. You can find them in News Feed or in Groups, and when viewing a reel on Facebook, you can easily follow the creator directly from the video, like and comment on it, or share it with friends.
Facebook also today announced it would be offering a new bonus program for content creators in hopes of spurring-up more Reels content on its platform. Reels in Facebook will be available starting today in the United States on iOS and Android.

                    <span>Apple and Google have been asked to provide compliance plans for a newly amended law in South Korea that bars both tech giants from forcing developers to using their in-app purchase payment system for their respective app distribution platforms, Reuters reports.





In August, South Korea passed an amendment to an existing law that bans Apple and Google from mandating developers to use their own proprietary in-app purchasing system. Apple&#x27;s in-app purchasing system gives the company a 15 to 30% commission for all purchases made and has been a hot topic for Apple and the discussion around the App Store for some time. Under the new law in South Korea, which is yet to go into effect, Apple and Google will be required to allow developers to use third-party payment methods within their app. 



Apple has in recent weeks made some concessions to its ‌App Store‌ policy, most notably pivoting to allow developers to add links in their apps to external websites where purchases can be made. Those concessions come short of the mandate created by South Korea, which permits developers to add third-party payment methods directly within their app. 



Apple has continued to call its in-app purchasing system the most trusted and safest way for customers to make purchases. Still, in light of recent decisions in its lawsuit against Epic Games, the Cupertino tech giant is being forced to rethink its model. 



Apple operates the ‌App Store‌ under a single set of policies worldwide, and while the law passed in South Korea pertains to South Korean users, it will undoubtedly play a domino effect across the globe. With the mid-October deadline now set in South Korea for Apple and Google, we&#x27;ll likely see how this decision could have repercussions around the world for Apple users soon.

                    <span>The newly launched iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro are apparently hitting a snag in production, mainly due to a new wave of health concerns and limited manufacturing capacity for the devices&#x27; camera systems in Vietnam, according to a new report from Nikkei Asia. 





The ‌iPhone 13‌ mini, ‌iPhone 13‌, ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌, and ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ Max all feature sensor-shift optical image stabilization, a feature that was previously exclusive to the iPhone 12 Pro Max, and the feature’s expansion is reportedly the root cause of production difficulties.

                    <span>Strong iPhone 13 demand in Taiwan and China has led Taiwanese component suppliers to prioritize production lines for Apple over rival Samsung and many Chinese mobile vendors, according to a new DigiTimes report.




Taiwan-based makers of VCMs (voice coil motors), wire winding and other components of smartphone-use lens modules are giving priority to production for Apple, amid strong pre-sales of iPhone 13 series in China and Taiwan, according to industry sources.
The report states that Samsung&#x27;s third-quarter sales this year fell short of expectations, while Chinese smartphone vendors including Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi have high inventory levels of components.

                    <span>Some new iPhone 13 users are reporting intermittent touch issues on their new devices, a phenomenon where the iPhone does not respond to touch inputs by the user, sometimes requiring an entire device force restart to solve, or in other cases, repeated taps to trigger the system to react.





Posts on Reddit, the MacRumors Forums, Twitter, and Apple Support include reports of ‌iPhone 13‌ customers having touch sensitivity issues on their new phones. Users report problems with tap to wake, where the ‌iPhone‌ doesn&#x27;t respond after a tap on the screen to wake, and other instances of system-wide and in-app touch inputs not responding. 




Anyone&#x27;s iPhone 13 not registering touch events consistently? Is that an app thing, an iOS 15 thing, or my iPhone 13 thing

                    <span>Apple&#x27;s latest developer beta of macOS Monterey contains references to a &quot;High Power Mode&quot; that could boost performance when a MacBook isn&#x27;t connected to a power adapter. 





The reference, spotted by 9to5Mac, harks back to a similar so-called &quot;Pro Mode&quot; that was found in a developer beta of macOS Catalina 10.15.3 back in January 2020. 



&quot;Pro Mode&quot; was referred to in the code as making apps run faster at the expense of consuming more battery and increasing fan noise, but the feature never made it to the public Catalina release and references to such a mode were absent in Monterey until beta 8, which was released on Tuesday.



&quot;High Power Mode&quot; isn&#x27;t available to users, and beyond the name appearing in code, nothing is known about the referenced feature, although a &quot;Low Power Mode&quot; already exists in ‌macOS Monterey‌ that reduces performance in MacBooks to conserve battery life, so presumably &quot;High Power Mode&quot; will operate at the other extreme and let users run apps and hardware at maximum performance when not connected to power.



It&#x27;s unclear whether Apple will announce &quot;High Power Mode&quot; as an upcoming feature in ‌macOS Monterey‌. Likewise, there&#x27;s no way of knowing if the feature would be available on all Macs or be exclusive to certain models, such as the upcoming 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models rumored to drop this fall. Apple is expected to release ‌macOS Monterey‌ in the next few weeks.

                    <span>Apple has called off a joint project with Samsung to use a Samsung-developed OLED display for a forthcoming 10.9-inch iPad Air, according to a new report today from The Elec. 




The project was stopped due to either the single stack structure of OLED panel or profitability issues or both, people familiar with the matter said.
Single stack refers to the current widely used OLED panel structure where red, green and blue form one emission layer. 



Apple is reportedly not satisfied with the brightness levels of single stack OLED panels and is also wary of the panel&#x27;s lifespan, since consumers typically hold onto iPads for longer compared to smartphones, which have a more aggressive upgrade cycle. 



Instead, Apple wants to use a two-stack tandem structure for its first OLED iP…</span>

                    <span>Apple&#x27;s 96W USB-C power adapter that is designed for use with the 16-inch MacBook Pro currently faces a lengthy 2-3 months shipping estimate on the company&#x27;s online store in the United States and many other countries. The adapter is also listed as unavailable for in-store pickup at most Apple retail stores around the world.





In some countries like Japan, the 2-3 months shipping estimate began showing up in August, and the delay has since extended to more countries. 



While redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models are rumored to launch later this year, many tech companies are facing supply constraints due to a global chip shortage, so the reason for the 96W power adapter&#x27;s shipping delay is ultimately unclear.



Apple has included the 96W power adapter with the 16-inch MacBook Pro since the notebook launched in November 2019, and it is also sold separately for $79, albeit now with the lengthy shipping delay. The previous-generation 15-inch MacBook Pro was bundled with an 87W power adapter, which Apple has since discontinued.



Apple&#x27;s smaller 20W, 30W, and 61W power adapters are currently not facing any extended shipping delays in the United States.



A source at an Apple Authorized Reseller informed MacRumors that their distributors currently do not have any stock of the 96W power adapter, suggesting that the power adapter is facing significant supply constraints across multiple channels.



Apple is widely rumored to be planning redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with a faster version of the M1 chip and brighter mini-LED displays. Rumors suggest the notebooks will return to a design with an HDMI port and SD card reader, a magnetic power cable, and physical function keys instead of the Touch Bar.

                    <span>Jason Snell, Six Colors:
The problem is that most people don’t buy a new iPhone every year.
The primary upgraders to the iPhone 13 will be coming from the
iPhone 7, or 8, or X, or XS, or XR. For them, several years of
Apple innovations will be rolled into a single purchase. But
reviews of the new iPhones will not address what happened in 2018,
or 2019, or 2020.
Here’s an attempt to provide a little more of a big-picture
overview for owners of older iPhones who are wondering what’s new
in the iPhone 13. I’ve simplified matter a little — if you own a
“plus” or “max” model of iPhone, obviously your phone will be a
little larger, and you may want to consider the direct upgrade to
the iPhone 13 Pro Max to continue with your large phone. The
iPhone 13 mini is also a great option for those who prefer a
smaller phone with all the same power as the larger iPhone 13.
This is a fantastic idea. You just scroll down to whatever iPhone you’re currently using, and boom, there’s a list of the top upgrades you’d experience if you upgrade to an iPhone 13. Apple’s excellent iPhone Compare page has all this information, but the Compare page also tells you everything that’s the same or roughly equivalent between models. Snell’s guide focuses on the big changes from iPhone Old and iPhone New.

                    <span>Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai, reporting for Motherboard:
On Thursday, a security researcher published details of three
iPhone vulnerabilities that are unpatched as of today. The
security researcher, whose name is Denis Tokarev, said he decided
to publish the bugs’ details as well as the source code that makes
it extremely easy to reproduce and exploit them, because he was
tired of waiting and felt like Apple ignored him.
Tokarev reported the vulnerabilities to Apple between March 10 and
April 29, but the last time he heard back from Apple about the
three vulnerabilities was August 6, August 12, and August 25,
respectively. Then the researcher said he told Apple on September
13 he would publish details of the bugs unless he heard back.
It was only after he went public with details about the unpatched
bugs that Apple reached out, according to Tokarev, who shared
Apple’s email with Motherboard.
“We saw your blog post regarding this issue and your other
reports. We apologize for the delay in responding to you,” an
Apple employee wrote. “We want to let you know that we are still
investigating these issues and how we can address them to protect
customers. Thank you again for taking the time to report these
issues to us, we appreciate your assistance. Please let us know if
you have any questions.”
Tokarev, in his follow-up post:
Indeed, I do have questions.

YouTube is taking down several video channels associated with
high-profile anti-vaccine activists including Joseph Mercola and
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who experts say are partially responsible
for helping seed the skepticism that’s contributed to slowing
vaccination rates across the country.
As part of a new set of policies aimed at cutting down on
anti-vaccine content on the Google-owned site, YouTube will ban
any videos that claim that commonly used vaccines approved by
health authorities are ineffective or dangerous. The company
previously blocked videos that made those claims about coronavirus
vaccines, but not ones for other vaccines like those for measles
or chickenpox.
Misinformation researchers have for years said the popularity of
anti-vaccine content on YouTube was contributing to growing
skepticism of lifesaving vaccines in the United States and around
the world.

Apple and Alphabet’s Google have been asked to turn in by
mid-October compliance plans for a new South Korean law that bans
major app store operators from forcing software developers to use
their payment systems, a regulatory official said on Wednesday.
Apple and Google did not have immediate comment.
Get your popcorn ready; I have no idea what to expect here.

I retweeted TopTechGeek’s iPhone 13 Pro unboxing video over the weekend, and quipped that, as requested, I’d be staying tuned for more content. Didn’t take long to pay off.

                    <span>Cloacal Protuberance is a gore project from the USA. This debut stuff was recorded live, and must say the result is very cool. I think that is because members of CP played/playing in Invidiosus, Rottenness, ex-Deterioration, Violence Condoned, as you may see these boys know how to make a nice noise. As, almost all, bands in this genre guys used a disgusting image for the cover… nothing new, but I like the final result. I know that everything here is made in DIY way and more of the riffs is improvisation, but damn, this shit is loud, haha! Yes, generally …</span>

A depth option for the Flyers will have to go under the knife.
 The Philadelphia Flyers will be without one of their safety nets at forward this season, as head coach Alain Vigneault announced on Wednesday that center Tanner Laczynski will be out for the entirety of the 2021-22 season.
This unfortunately isn’t anything new for the 24-year-old, as just last season he had to undergo hip surgery to repair a torn labrum in April, cutting that campaign short. Now just five months later — one month out of his recovery timeline — he has injured the opposite hip and needs another surgery, ending his entire season and will hold him away from a professional hockey game for over 17 months. This dude just cannot catch a break.

Let’s talk standouts!
 We’re back, folks! Hockey is back and the Flyers kicked off the preseason in perhaps the most Flyers way possible—with an exciting comeback to tie the game and a prompt loss in overtime—last night against the Islanders. The result was a tough one, but we remind ourselves that it was the first game back after all, and a lot of rust is being shaken off. Expectations are manageable here, so we’re focusing on a pretty simple question as we ease into the preseason—who looked sharp right out of the gate?

Not the outcome you’d like, but not half bad either.
 Flyers hockey is officially back. The Orange &amp; Black opened up the preseason tonight with a match in the Wells Fargo Center against Barry Trotz and the hated Islanders. What were the storylines, who stood out, and what unreasonably hyperbolic conclusions can we draw from the 60 minutes of play we witnessed? All of that and more below.
What went right?
The Flyers had some strong individual player performances tonight, even if they ebbed and flowed in terms of team success. Derick Brassard, Ryan Ellis, Oskar Lindblom, and Yegor Zamula particularly stood out as positives, although that’s not saying that guys like Sean Couturier, Claude Giroux, or Keith Yandle didn’t impress either.

Roblox developers are copying the show’s bloody games
 A series of knockoffs of Squid Game, Netflix’s latest battle royale show, have proliferated across the gaming platform Roblox. The platform’s trending section is now littered with titles like “Squid Game” and “Red Light Green Light,” with 8.3 million visits and 27.6 million visits, respectively. 
Squid Game is a new Korean thriller on Netflix that hit the streaming service on Sept. 17. Since then, it’s become a viral hit; it’s the most-watched show on Netflix in the United States, and it’s currently on track to become its most-watched show of all time worldwide, according to Netflix.

The MMO has hundreds of thousands of players and massive queue times
 Amazon’s MMO New World was finally released on Tuesday after months of testing and delays, but it’s already a little too popular for its servers. This has led to long queues as players try to log into the game.
During its official launch day of Sept. 28, New World peaked at number two on Steam with a player count of just over 700,000. This massive player count is good news for Amazon, but the game’s servers apparently weren’t up to the task. The game has over 26,000 Steam reviews, and most of them — which Steam labels as Mixed, with just 48% skewing positive at the time of writing — complain about the game’s massive queues and limited server capacity. 
Of course, Amazon Game Studios is more than aware of New World’s problem. In a launch day update post on the game’s website, the developer explained that its short-term goal is setting up new servers and working to expand the capacity of the ones that are already online, in order to help everyone log in and play as soon as possible. 
Amazon Game Studios also has a long-term plan to let players transfer their characters to an entirely new server for free in the next two weeks. This should help balance the load so that certain overpopulated servers aren’t too stressed, while lower-population servers — with lower queue times — should get a boost in players to even things out.
While all of these plans should help reduce the queue times in the future for New World, it’s likely that players will still have to deal with a wait to log in for the next few days, especially on more populated servers. But as Amazon rolls out its solutions, and the hype eventually dies down a bit, players should hopefully be able to get into Aeternum a little more quickly.</span>

Pro players become Champions in an all-out international brawl
 The 2021 League of Legends World Championship is about to begin, but first, Riot is kicking off the event with another new song and animated video featuring many of the world’s best pro players. This time around the track is called “Burn it All Down” by the synth-pop band Pvris, while the video was created by Haoliners Animation. 
The new video features several current and former League of Legends stars battling it out and transforming into some of their signature champions. Lee “Faker” Sang-hyeok, one of League’s most famous players and most frequent world champion, returns for this video, which is particularly fitting since he’s back on the Worlds’ stage this year after missing out in 2020. The video also features players like last year’s Worlds’ MVP Kim “Canyon” Geon-bu, and former-world champions Kim “DoinB” Tae-sang, who is one of the top players heading into the tournament this year. 
Riot releases a new Worlds theme song every year, generally partnering with new artists each time. In 2014 Imagine Dragons wrote the song Warriors for the event, while Zedd, who worked with Riot on creating weapon skins in Valorant earlier this year, wrote Ignite for Worlds 2016. This is the first time that Riot has worked with Pvris. Meanwhile Chinese animation studio Haoliners Animation had worked with Riot on several projects before partnering for this video. 
The 2021 League of Legends World Championship will begin with its preliminary play-in stage on Oct. 5 in Reykjavík, Iceland. The tournament’s Grand Finals will be held on Nov. 6, the same day that Riot will premiere the first episodes of its Netflix animated series Arcane.</span>

                    <span>Balloon artist DJ Morrow has been branching out recently. Morrow makes elaborate balloon animals and other things but two of his latest creations are his amazing interpretations of Francisco Goya’s Saturn Devouring His Son and Judith Beheading Holofernes by Caravaggio. I can’t stop looking at these. And prints are available! (thx, caroline)

When an AirTag is set in Lost Mode, it generates a URL for https://found.apple.com and it lets the AirTag owner enter a contact phone number or email address. Anyone who scans that AirTag is then directed automatically to the URL with the owner&#x27;s contact information, with no login or personal information required to view the provided contact details.



According to KrebsOnSecurity, Lost Mode does not prevent users from injecting arbitrary computer code into the phone number field, so a person who scans an AirTag can be redirected to a phony iCloud login page or anot…</span>

                    <span>Apple today updated its investor relations page to announce that it will share its earnings results for the fourth fiscal quarter (third calendar quarter) of 2021 on Thursday, October 28.





The fourth quarter earnings call will provide some insight into the early sales of the new iPhone 13 models and the new iPad options, giving us our first hints into how 2021 sales compared with 2020 sales.



Apple again declined to provide guidance for the fourth quarter of 2021 during its third quarter earnings call due to the ongoing global health crisis, which is continuing to cause uncertainty for product launch timelines and sales.



Apple in the third quarter brought in $81.4 billion in revenue, marking a new June quarter record thanks to strong sales of the iPhone, ‌iPad‌, and Mac.



The quarterly earnings statement will be released at 1:30 PM Pacific/4:30 PM Eastern, with a conference call to discuss the report taking place at 2:00 PM Pacific/5:00 PM Eastern. MacRumors will provide coverage of both the earnings release and conference call on October 29.

                    <span>Apple today seeded the eighth developer beta of macOS Monterey, the newest version of the macOS operating system. The eighth beta comes one week after Apple released the seventh macOS Monterey beta.





Registered developers can download the beta through the Apple Developer Center and once the appropriate profile is installed, betas will be available through the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences. 



According to Apple&#x27;s release notes, attempts to install ‌macOS Monterey‌ into a virtual machine will no longer fail sporadically after updating to the latest beta. 



‌macOS Monterey‌ will bring Universal Control, a feature that lets a single mouse, trackpad, and keyboard be used across multiple Mac or iPad devices, plus there&#x27;s a new AirPlay to Mac feature. Safar…</span>

                    <span>Apple last week launched an updated version of the iPad mini, which has been entirely overhauled with an iPad Air-like design. The new mini is basically a smaller version of the iPad Air, and we thought we&#x27;d check it out and share first impressions after 48 hours with the little tablet.

With an 8.3-inch display, the ‌iPad mini‌ has a bigger screen size than ever before, but it&#x27;s actually a touch less tall than the prior-generation version thanks to much slimmer bezels and the removal of the Home button.





Since there&#x27;s no Home button, the ‌iPad mini‌ uses a Touch ID power button, which works well. It&#x27;s just like the ‌Touch ID‌ power button on the ‌iPad Air‌, and it&#x27;s identical to the ‌Touch ID‌ Home buttons we…</span>

                    <span>iPad mini 6 owners have been complaining about a &quot;jelly scrolling&quot; problem that affects some iPad mini models when using the device in portrait mode, and Apple now says that the behavior is normal for an LCD screen.





&quot;Jelly scrolling&quot; refers to screen tearing, which can cause text or images on one side of the screen to appear to be tilted downwards because of a mismatch in refresh rates. It can cause one side of the display to look as if it&#x27;s responding faster than the other side, a visual disturbance that&#x27;s hard to miss once you notice it.



Apple told Ars Technica that jelly scroll is normal behavior for an LCD. The screen is designed to refresh line by line, which can cause a tiny delay between when the lines at the top of the screen and the bottom of the screen are refre…</span>

                    <span>Apple today seeded the second beta of iOS 15.1 to developers, and the update includes a fix for an annoying bug that&#x27;s been affecting iPhone 13 owners who also have an Apple Watch.





With beta 2, the Unlock with Apple Watch feature that was broken has been fixed, and an authenticated Apple Watch can once again be used to unlock an ‌iPhone 13‌ model when wearing a mask. 



Prior to the update, attempting to enable the Unlock with Apple Watch feature under Settings &gt; Face ID &amp; Passcode would result in an error that said the iPhone was unable to communicate with the Apple Watch. That error message has now been addressed, and the feature can be successfully toggled on after updating to iOS 15.1 beta 2. 



Apple in a support document promised that a fix for the issue would be coming in a future update, and it appears that update may be iOS 15.1. It&#x27;s not clear if we&#x27;ll also see an iOS 15.0.1 update that has a fix, as it could still be several weeks before iOS 15.1 sees a public release.

                    <span>DisplayMate today awarded the iPhone 13 Pro Max with its &quot;Best Smartphone Display Award.&quot; The device earned the company&#x27;s highest-ever display performance grade of A+ and set or matched 12 of its smartphone display performance records.





iPhone 13 Pro models feature a new Super Retina XDR display with ProMotion, which is Apple&#x27;s branding for a variable refresh rate between 10Hz and 120Hz. This technology allows the display to refresh from a power-preserving 10 times per second to an ultra smooth 120 times per second depending on the type of content that is on the screen.



One of the records that the iPhone 13 Pro Max set was highest full-screen brightness for smartphones with OLED displays, according to DisplayMate&#x27;s in-depth analysis. Apple says the iPhone 13 Pro Max has a max brightness of 1,000 nits for typical content and 1,200 nits for HDR content. By comparison, the iPhone 12 Pro Max has a max brightness of 800 nits for typical content and 1,200 nits for HDR content.



Other records set or matched by the iPhone 13 Pro Max include highest absolute color accuracy, highest contrast ratio, lowest screen reflectance, and more.



Samsung is the exclusive supplier of the LTPO OLED panels used for the iPhone 13 Pro Max, according to Display Supply Chain Consultants, but LG is reportedly aiming to begin supplying Apple with LTPO OLED panels as early as next year.



DisplayMate extensively tested the iPhone 13 Pro Max&#x27;s display, so make sure to read the full analysis for more details.

Other than new releases, tvOS updates are often minor in scale, focusing on under-the-hood bug fixes and improvements rather than major outward-facing changes. We don&#x27;t yet know what&#x27;s included in tvOS 15.1, but we&#x27;ll update this article should anything be found.

Epic and Amazon&#x27;s stores will be discoverable on the Microsoft Store for Windows and can be downloaded like any other app.





As a reason for the change, Microsoft said that it wants to ensure that its &quot;business terms are fair&quot; and also to &quot;help promote innovation.&quot;
Our commitment to being an &#x27;open Store for an open platform&#x27; isn&#x27;t just about the various technical underpinnings of how apps are built. It&#x27;s also about making sure our business terms are fair and help promote innovation. For instance, the Microsoft Store on Windows no longer requires app developers to share revenue with Microsoft, when apps manage their …</span>

                    <span>Following the launch of the iPhone 13 models, Apple&#x27;s vice president of camera hardware engineering Graham Townsend and vice president of camera software engineering Jon McCormack spoke with British GQ&#x27;s Robert Leedham about iPhone cameras.





Townsend revealed that Apple starts planning future iPhone camera systems about three years in advance of public availability, suggesting that the company began developing the camera systems on the iPhone 13 models as early as 2018.
&quot;The planning has to start about three years ahead, because that&#x27;s when we actually fix the specification of the silicon,&quot; says Townsend. &quot;So, for instance, the sensor gets defined at that point and the A15 Bionic processor is also frozen.

                    <span>In a new blog post titled &quot;Bring the best of Google to your iPhone,&quot; Google is on an endeavor to convince new iPhone 13 users to transform their ‌device’s home screen to look like Android.





The blog post, written by Google&#x27;s director for the iOS platform, features screenshots of an ‌iPhone 13‌ home screen filled with Google apps and widgets. The post implies that customers should possibly consider replacing some of Apple&#x27;s default iOS apps, such as Photos, Safari, Calendar, Reminders, and even Phone, with Google&#x27;s equivalent of those apps, including Google ‌Photos‌, Google Chrome, Google Calendar, Google Tasks, and Google Voice, respectively.



Google continued to encourage customers to utilize the wide variety of ‌widgets‌ its iOS apps offer. Google said that if the right Google ‌widgets‌ are placed on the home screen, users will &quot;never even have to leave&quot; their home screens to stay caught up.



According to the blog post, users can also use &quot;Smart Stacks&quot; to stack different Google ‌widgets‌ on top of each other, allowing iOS to determine which widget is most relevant to show at any one time. 



Finally, Google recommends that users replace Safari with Google Chrome as the default iOS browser, allowing all system-wide links and Spotlight web suggestions to open in Chrome. Google closed by saying it hopes ‌iPhone 13‌ users, who just started receiving their new iPhones last week, will consider bringing &quot;the best of Google&quot; to their device instead of just simply purchasing an Android smartphone or device.

                    <span>macOS Monterey is set to be released later this year with Safari 15, with key new features including redesigned tabs, grouped tabs, automatic switching of sites from HTTP to more secure HTTPS when available, faster performance, improved security, and more. Apple also released Safari 15 for macOS Big Sur and macOS Catalina last week.





Unfortunately, some customers have experienced a few issues with Safari 15, which we&#x27;ve highlighted in more detail below.



YouTube Bookmarking Issue


On both macOS Big Sur and the macOS Monterey beta, it appears that attempting to bookmark a YouTube page in Safari 15 results in the browser crashing.






The issue was demonstrated with a video shared by YouTube channel Krazy Wabbit. As a temporary workaround, the video notes that user…</span>

                    <span>Anyone who says the government has our best interests at heart has not read history. There is a long and sordid history of medical experimentation, often with the involvement of the U.S. Military, the medical establishment, chemical corporations, and the pharmaceutical industry, that many people know the “greatest hits” of—the Manhattan Project, MK Ultra—but there […]

                    <span>Local note, quite possibly of interest to non-locals as well: I’ll be on stage this Thursday afternoon at 2 pm for the B. PHL Innovation Fest, in a chat with Youngmoo Kim, director of Drexel’s ExCITe Center. It’ll be him, interviewing me, about the stuff I do and have done. I’ve known Youngmoo for a few years — this will be good. In-person attendance has been scrapped because of COVID-19 (they haven’t updated the website to make this clear), but virtual attendance registration is open and is now free of charge.
Good lineup of keynote speakers too, including Don Lemon and Sixers president Daryl Morey. (If I see him backstage, I’ll try to get the scoop on Ben Simmons.)

                    <span>September is Childhood Cancer Awareness Month, and the good folks at Relay FM always conduct a fundraiser. This year they’ve already raised a whopping $572K as I type this. What a wonderful annual tradition this is. St. Jude is an amazing institution: they both provide world-class treatment for kids with cancer free of charge and perform research to make those treatments better and more effective. Tiltify, the platform they’re using for fundraising, makes it super simple to contribute, including support for Apple Pay.
Let’s push Relay’s campaign way over the top with a push from the DF audience. (And if you do chip in, check if your employer matches charitable contributions.)

                    <span>Last April, after posting this photo of my desk setup for my iPad Air review, I got a few questions about the stand I was using to prop up the iPad. The answer was Anker’s $15 Multi-Angle Stand. Last week I posted a similar photo, this time for my iPad Mini review, and I’m still using the same stand. Alas, that stand is no longer available.
The closest thing I could find is this $10 copy of that stand from Amazon Basics. It’s such a blatant rip-off of Anker’s stand that ordinarily I wouldn’t link to it, on principle, but, given that Anker’s original is seemingly no longer being produced, a rip-off design is the best we can do. I even bought one to try it out before linking to it. (If you buy one through this link, I’ll earn affiliate revenue that will get me one step closer to buying one of the upcoming Jony Ive/Marc Newson-designed electric Ferraris.)
Amazon’s multi-angle stand is extremely similar to Anker’s in size, weight, and angles of tilt. But it’s slightly lacking in fit and finish compared to Anker’s. Whereas Anker’s felt like a bargain at $15, this one feels like what you’d expect from a $10 knock-off. My biggest annoyance is that Amazon, for some reason, decided to screen print “Press/Presse” on the button that you quite obviously must press to adjust the tilt. (Why French?) This is as helpful as printing “Press” on the knock of a click pen. And of course they typeset these needless words in Arial. A wee nip of nail polish remover took care of that, though.
I still recommend it. It folds flat, and when your iPad is sitting in it, the stand effectively disappears.

                    <span>Katie Deighton, reporting for The Wall Street Journal:
Ferrari NV hired Apple Inc.’s former design chief Jony Ive as it
readies its debut into full electric vehicles.
Mr. Ive’s design company LoveFrom Inc., which he formed in 2019
alongside industrial designer Marc Newson, will work with Ferrari
and its largest shareholder, Netherlands-based Exor NV on a number
of projects, the companies said Monday. […]
Ferrari declined to reveal the specifics of the collaboration, but
said it sees potential in working with LoveFrom across the whole
range of its business. Alongside its legacy production of its
engine-powered cars, the company sells clothes, watches and other
apparel.
If they wind up shipping a car through this collaboration, it might not cost that much more than the scrapped first draft Apple Car under Ive, which I’ve heard — admittedly like fourth-hand — would have started at $150,000. (Which is one of many reasons the project was rebooted.)
Cabel Sasser (click through for photos):
(Actually, Marc Newson’s Ford 021C concept was my dream car right
around 2000. It’s the perfect encapsulation of the style of that
time, a Deee-Lite/CD-ROM/Dreamcast/iMac/Virgin Megastore car. I
still want one today!!! But the Fun Design Train now only stops at
Luxury Station ☹️)
Newson’s concept car was indeed delightful — real-world car-from-Pixar’s Cars vibe to it.

Hey worst case, they can’t be as bad as the Eagles were last night.
 


It’s been a short, yet at the same time long off-season, but tonight the Philadelphia Flyers will hit the ice and play a preseason hockey game. A lot has changed since the Orange &amp; Black finished their 2020-21 season with a win over the New Jersey Devils on May 10, and tonight we get our first look at the new-look Flyers. 



At bare minimum what we cannot say about this team heading into the season is: this is the same ol’ Flyers. Jakub Voracek had been here since 2011, he’s out. Shayne Gostisbehere since 2015, he’s out. Nolan Patrick was the second overall pick a little over four years ago, he’s out. But in are an exciting group of players that it feels like Philly…</span>

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *Holy moly the games have arrived! Preseason games, but still. Real hockey games on your television. VERY EXCITING. Ahead of the real game, here’s a look at what happened in the friendly scrimmage that closed out training camp. [Flyers]
*Sean Couturier is not at all nervous about living up to his new contract this season. Which makes sense, since he already has. [Inquirer]
*If you are anything like us at Broad Street Hockey, you’re very interested to see how these new defense pairings look in these preseason games. In camp, at least, it seemed like the Ellis-Provy pair is going to work out just fine. [NBC Sports Philly]
*Speaking of that pair, Ryan Ellis doesn’t just want to be a good partner on the ice. He wants to be a good buddy, too. [BSH]
*Sticking with our badass new defense, Keith Yandle doesn’t care about his Ironman streak. He’s just good at playing hockey. [Inquirer]
*Once again, the Metro Division is shaping up to be the toughest in hockey. Hooray! [The Hockey News]
*And finally, pals, it’s been a long Summer. A busy Summer. The Flyers might be good again. And tonight, we start to get a look at them. Enjoy the game, everyone! Let’s go Flyers!!</span>

                    <span>In May, CNN’s Kyung Lah cornered Karen Fann, the Republican president of Arizona’s Senate, in a parking lot. Fann had recently commissioned a bogus “audit”—since more accurately dubbed a “fraudit”—of the 2020 presidential election results in Maricopa County, where Joe Biden won and Trump lied about having won, and Lah wanted to ask her about […]</span>

Oxenfree 2 still on the way
 Netflix has acquired Oxenfree developer Night School Studio, the companies announced Tuesday. The game studio, known for its branching narratives, will create original games for the streaming platform’s nascent foray into video games.
Night School Studio founder Sean Krankel said in a blog post about the acquisition that the company will continue working on Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals, which it currently expects to launch in early 2022 on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC. As the first games studio to join Netflix on this new project, said Krankel, Night School wants to “stretch [its] narrative and design aspirations across distinctive, original games with heart.”
Krankel added, “Our explorations in n…</span>

God fucking dammit Kris where the fuck are we
 Undertale spawned a following that turned it into a cultural touchstone for an entire generation of gamers. So when its creator, Toby Fox, released a new chapter of his Undertale spinoff, Deltarune, there was no surprise that this new section of the game would inspire players to create art and write fanfiction. Fans are now filling Twitter, Reddit, and YouTube with Deltarune Chapter 2 memes starring two of the game’s main characters, Kris and Susie. 
Deltarune is a spinoff of Undertale. The entire game isn’t out yet — Fox split it into chapters, and released the first one in 2018. In September, he announced a surprise release of the second chapter via an anniversary stream for Undertale, and has since said that he will…</span>

The space puzzler’s Echoes of the Eye DLC encouraged me to revisit the modern classic
 I first played Outer Wilds in 2019, when the game was initially released. I marveled at the galaxy’s beautiful planets, playing as a Hearthian alien on my first space expedition. The trip would take me away from my home of Timber Hearth and across the cosmos, exploring archaeological ruins, and sussing out the civilization that left them behind. The game was, put simply, stunning.
But Outer Wilds was also incredibly difficult. Navigating the ship required controlling six thrusters, and charting a course that would let me land on orbiting celestial bodies. The game’s time loop proved to be the ultimate challenge, throwing me back into my starting place …</span>

Players who have pre-ordered the game will get to play for two extra days
 Battlefield 2042 is delayed until November, but its beta is still ready for the near future. The beta will run from Oct. 6-9, Electronic Arts and developer DICE announced on Tuesday. 
The open beta will include Battlefield’s signature Conquest mode, but with a slight twist: Two teams will compete to control several flags in certain areas, rather than larger individual control points. The beta will feature the game’s Orbital map, which takes the fight to an active rocket launch site. During the beta, players can choose to play as one of four different specialists, who each more or less represent a traditional Battlefield class and have their own abilities. 
Battlefield 2042 players who have pre-ordered the game will get access to the beta starting on Oct. 6 for an exclusive two-day early access period. The beta will open up for all players starting on Oct. 8. The beta will be available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. PlayStation Plus is not required to participate in the open beta, but if you plan to play on Xbox, you will need an active Xbox Live Gold subscription.
DICE and EA also announced the PC system requirements for the beta, which you can find below:

Meet Mikaela Reid
 Dead by Daylight is a scary game, so it’s appropriate we’re getting an update on the game’s next character as we head into October and towards Halloween. The next content update for Dead by Daylight is Hour of the Witch, and it includes a new Survivor named Mikaela Reid.
We didn’t get a look at Mikaela’s exclusive perks, which change the way each Survivor plays. However, Survivors tend to be much squishier and more vulnerable than Killers, and have very little, if anything, in the way of offensive capabilities. It seems that Mikaela may be able to use her witchy ways to help the team in a support capability, as a tweet by developer Behaviour Interactive reads “She brings light and life to a realm of darkness and death.”

It makes sense to get a new Survivor, as the last addition to the game was Pinhead. The Hellraiser update only contained a Killer. Usually these updates also have a complementary Survivor. While Pinhead is a licensed character, Mikaela appears to be totally original to Dead by Daylight, and she’ll likely have some sort of story that explains how she ended up in the Fog.</span>

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/27/beats-flex-headphones-price-increase/">

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(7 min)</span>
                    <span>Apple today increased the price of its Beats Flex headphones from $49.99 to $69.99, a pricing shift that may be related to supply chain constraints that have raised the costs of components across the industry.





First released last October, the Beats Flex made headlines at launch because of their low price compared to other Apple headphone options, and they have been a popular purchase option since. The Beats Flex are a follow-up to the BeatsX, and feature an in-ear design with a wire between the left and right earbuds.



Given their low price, the Beats Flex may have been more susceptible to cost pressures than some other Apple products. At $20 more expensive, the Beats Flex are still a very affordable option to get into the Apple headphone ecosystem, but it&#x27;s not quite as impressive a deal as before. They come in Black, Flame Blue, Yuzu Yellow, and Smoke Gray, and offer much of the same seamless connectivity functionality available with Apple&#x27;s more expensive Beats options.



Auto-play/pause is included, and the Beats Flex last for up to 12 hours without needing to be recharged. There&#x27;s a Fast Fuel charging option that offers 1.5 hours of playback, and they feature Find My integration.



The pricing change of the Beats Flex was first noticed by Twitter user Pedro Henrique and was highlighted by 9to5Mac. The Beats Flex can be purchased from the Apple Store, but Amazon currently has them on sale for as low as $37, so those considering a purchase should buy them on Amazon before prices go up.

                    <span>Apple recently introduced the sixth-generation iPad mini, featuring a complete redesign, a larger display, the A15 Bionic chip, and more. The ‌iPad mini‌ now effectively shares the design of the iPad Air, with both devices possessing many of the same features such as an all-screen design with no Home button, Touch ID in the top power button, and stereo speakers.





Since the ‌iPad Air‌ was released a whole year ago in September 2020, should you buy the more expensive, older, bigger-screened ‌iPad Air‌, or opt for the new ‌iPad mini‌? Our guide answers the question of how to decide which of these two iPads is best for you.

                    <span>Google today lambasted European Union regulators for ignoring Apple and the rivalry between Apple and Android in the antitrust accusations that have been levied against Google, reports Reuters.





Apple was brought up as part of Google&#x27;s attempt to get a massive 4.34 billion euro ($5.1 billion) fine annulled. The European Commission first levied the fine against Google in 2018 because Google pre-installed its own services (Google Search and the Chrome browser) on Android to ensure its dominance in internet search.



According to Google, the European Commission has ignored the dynamic between Apple and Google and has downplayed the impact that Apple has on the mobile device market.

                    <span>iFixit has started one of its traditional full device teardowns on the new iPhone 13 Pro, giving us a complete look at all of the components that are inside.





Prior to taking a look inside the new iPhone, iFixit did X-rays to show off the L-shaped battery, the MagSafe magnet ring, and stabilizing magnets for image sensors and logic boards.



This year&#x27;s iPhone 13 Pro has an upper sensor cable near the top that&#x27;s easy to rip during repairs, with iFixit calling it &quot;scary thin.&quot; Visually, the Taptic Engine inside the device that controls Haptic Touch appears to be smaller, but it&#x27;s actually bulkier than the similar component in the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌, weighing in at 6.3 grams, up from 4.8.

                    <span>Apple has unveiled limited edition Beats Studio3 headphones in partnership with A-COLD-WALL, a fashion brand by British designer Samuel Ross.





The wireless headphones will be available in a slate color with a &quot;speckled cement&quot; finish that covers both the headphones and ear cushions. There&#x27;s an ACW logo on the outside of the headband, while the inside of the headband has a clay color with more A-COLD-WALL branding. The included carrying case is also branded with an ACW logo.



The limited edition Beats are listed as coming soon on Apple&#x27;s online store, with pricing set at $349.95 in the United States.



Apple first released the Beats Studio3 in September 2017 and several limited edition designs have been made available since then. The wireless over-ear headphones feature Apple&#x27;s W1 chip for seamless setup with Apple devices, up to 22 hours of battery life with active noise cancellation enabled, a foldable design, and more. Keep in mind the headphones are four years old and still have Bluetooth 4.0 and a micro USB port for charging.

                    <span>Apple made few design changes to the iPhone 13 lineup and the new devices continue to feature a durable Ceramic Shield front to protect the display, a glass back, and flat edges at the side.






Allstate Protection Plans conducted one of its annual drop tests on the ‌iPhone 13‌ and 13 Pro, and found that due to the similar designs, the ‌iPhone 13‌ models are comparable to the iPhone 12 models when it comes to durability.



In a face-down drop test without a case, the ‌iPhone 13‌ survived a single drop with only minor damage, but it cracked at the top and bottom corners in the second drop test. The iPhone 13 Pro cracked across the bottom in its first drop test, and these are the same results seen with the ‌iPhone 12‌ models.

                    <span>Ferrari and its parent company Exor today announced a multi-year creative partnership with LoveFrom, the design firm co-founded by Apple&#x27;s former design chief Jony Ive and fellow designer Marc Newson.





&quot;The first expression of this new partnership will bring together Ferrari&#x27;s legendary performance and excellence with LoveFrom&#x27;s unrivalled experience and creativity that has defined extraordinary world changing products,&quot; said Ferrari, in a press release announcing the partnership. &quot;Beyond the collaboration with Ferrari, LoveFrom will explore a range of creative projects with Exor in the business of luxury.&quot;



&quot;As Ferrari owners and collectors, we could not be more excited about collaborating with this extraordinary company and in particular with the design team expertly led by Flavio Manzoni,&quot; said Ive and Newson, in a joint statement. &quot;We see some uniquely exciting opportunities working together which we believe will yield important and valuable work.&quot;



Ive will also join Exor&#x27;s Partners Council, a group that shares ideas with the company and explores potential business opportunities. 



In June 2019, Apple announced that Ive would be departing the company to form LoveFrom. At the time, Apple said that it would remain one of Ive&#x27;s primary clients, but it&#x27;s unclear which Apple products he has helped to design since then, if any. Apple did confirm that Ive was involved in the design of the colorful 24-inch iMac released in April, but Apple did not confirm if any of that work occurred after Ive left the company.



Ive reportedly recruited at least four of his former Apple colleagues to join LoveFrom. Airbnb announced a multi-year partnership with the design firm last year.

                    <span>Anker today introduced a new Gold Box sale on Amazon, taking up to 45 percent off select accessories for one day only. This time around, the deals include savings on USB-C wall chargers, portable batteries, and MagSafe-compatible wireless chargers.

In terms of accessories that are compatible with MagSafe, you&#x27;ll find the PowerWave Select+ Magnetic Pad for $19.99 ($10 off), and this one functions similarly to Apple&#x27;s own MagSafe Charger. The main difference is that Anker&#x27;s accessory only provides wireless charging up to 7.5W, compared to Apple&#x27;s at up to 15W.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/27/spotify-ios-15-battery-drain-fix-soon/">

                    <span>Following a flood of reports and complaints, Spotify has acknowledged that its app may be causing excessive battery drain and overheating issues on iOS 14.8 and the latest iOS 15 update, promising a fix in the not-so-distant future.





In a long and ongoing support thread on its website, which started weeks ago, Spotify says it is aware of battery drain reports and that it has passed those reports onto its technical iOS team. Spotify doesn&#x27;t state when a fix could be coming or whether it would be an app update or other troubleshooting steps. 



Users reporting the issue on the thread state that Spotify is listed as a consumer of battery life due to background activity, with no clear reason why. While most of the reports are from users running iOS 14.8 and iOS 15.0, there are also other sporadic reports of battery drainage on older iOS versions. Those users are advised to update for a possible patch and improved security. 



While Spotify is being held as the main culprit for the excessive drainage, it could also be a bug in ‌iOS 15‌ for some users. ‌iOS 15‌ has been littered with multiple bugs, including one limiting Apple Watch functionality with the just-released iPhone 13, issues with Apple Music, and other bugs that Apple has promised fixes for. Apple may be planning to release iOS 15.0.1 as soon as this week to patch those issues and others.

                    <span>Apple today added Guided Meditations and Pilates to Apple Fitness+, expanding the existing catalog of workout types already available on the service ahead of a significant expansion of 15+ additional countries later this year.





During the last Apple event earlier this month, Apple announced it would be expanding Fitness+ with Guided Meditations. This new workout type builds on the current Mindful Cooldowns workout, allowing Fitness+ users to &quot;reduce everyday stress, develop a greater sense of awareness, and build resilience to face life&#x27;s challenges.&quot; Guided Meditations sessions in 10 and 20 minute lengths will be available.



Alongside Strength, Core, and Yoga workouts, Fitness+ today also gained Pilates, a new low-impact workout that focuses on improving strength and flexibility. Pilates sessions will be guided and headed by Marimba Gold-Watts and Darryl Whiting, both professionals in fitness. Fitness+ is also gaining a new &quot;Workouts to Get Ready for Snow Season&quot; guide with workouts to improve skiers&#x27; and snowboarders&#x27; performance ahead of the winter. 



Later this fall, Apple Fitness+ will be expanding to 15 additional countries, including Austria, Brazil, Colombia, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Switzerland, and the UAE. Fitness+ will also be gaining group workouts powered by SharePlay later this year.

                    <span>Now that new iPad mini 6 owners have had a couple of days with Apple&#x27;s latest redesigned tablet, some users are noticing an issue being referred to as &quot;jelly scroll&quot; when viewing the screen in portrait mode.





The term refers to a noticeable effect when scrolling vertically through text-based content like a webpage or document, where each line of text appears to tilt down towards the left of the screen as it passes by. The effect makes it look as though one side of the display is responding faster than the other when a finger drags to scroll the page.



Several MacRumors readers have noted the issue, which seems to affect users to a variable degree. Some ‌iPad mini 6‌ owners claim they noticed the effect despite being ignorant of similar reports in the wild, while others see …</span>

                    <span>Shipments of Apple Silicon MacBooks will be cut in the first half of next year due to component shortages, a decline in working from home demand, and the introduction of a redesigned MacBook Air in the third quarter of 2022, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo&#x27;s latest investor note, seen by MacRumors.





From the note:

We forecast that the shipment of Apple Silicon processor-based MacBook models will be cut by approximately 15% in 1H22 and attribute it to three reasons: 1) component shortages, 2) structural demand change in the post- COVID-19 era, and 3) product transition between legacy and new models. 
According to Kuo, the shortage of components relates primarily to a continuing lack of power management integrated circuits, for which delivery times currently extend as fa…</span>

                    <span>Update: According to the video mentioned below, even if an iPhone 13 display is replaced with a genuine and original ‌iPhone 13‌ screen, Face ID will stop working. In the video, the repair provider swapped two original ‌iPhone 13‌ screens and in both cases, Face ID was inoperative after the new screens were installed. It seems to be the case that if the original screen is put back with the original ‌iPhone 13‌, Face ID returns, ruling out the possibility of an improper installation.



If a customer gets their ‌iPhone 13‌ display replaced by a third-party repair store or provider, such as those not licensed or affiliated with Apple through its Independent Repair Program, Face ID on the iPhone will no longer be useable.

                    <span>Apple plans to begin mass production of an upcoming redesigned MacBook Air featuring an updated, more powerful Apple silicon processor in the third quarter of 2022, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said today in a research note obtained by MacRumors.





Kuo has previously stated that the new MacBook Air will feature an entirely new design, including a mini-LED display and a more powerful Apple silicon processor. Kuo had earlier pinpointed a launch around the middle of 2022, now providing a more specific timeline for the late second quarter or early third quarter of 2022 for mass production getting underway. 



Bloomberg&#x27;s Mark Gurman has reported that the new MacBook Air will feature a &quot;thinner and lighter&quot; enclosure, two USB 4 ports, and a MagSafe charging connector. Apple leaker and YouTube personality Jon Prosser shared renders for the alleged upcoming MacBook Air earlier this year, showing most notably of all that Apple plans to release the new laptop in a range of colors, similar to the 24-inch M1 iMac. 



Apple last updated its MacBook Air with the M1 chip last November, which maintained the previous MacBook Air design. Despite the expectation that Apple will update several Macs in its lineup with Apple silicon before the end of this year, the MacBook Air doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;ll be one of them.

                    <span>I read this on a recommendation, I was a little skeptical about the whole Netflix culture thing.

We grew exhausted having to skim thousands of messages every day to keep up, so we built something better. A more deliberate way to chat.

                    <span>Apple support document acknowledges a problem a lot of iPhone 13 users are running into:
Apple has identified an issue where Unlock with Apple Watch
may not work with iPhone 13 devices. You might see “Unable to
Communicate with Apple Watch” if you try to unlock your iPhone
while wearing a face mask, or you might not be able to set up
Unlock with Apple Watch.
This issue will be fixed in an upcoming software update. Until the
update is available, you can turn off Unlock with Apple Watch and
use your passcode to unlock your iPhone 13.
I haven’t seen this issue, but I sympathize with those of you who’ve been hit by it. “Unlock With Apple Watch” almost completely mitigates the annoyance of using an iPhone with Face ID while wearing a mask.

One of the Flyers’ newest blueliners is looking to take their current partnership to a different level.
 The idea of chemistry in hockey is something that cannot be easily contributed to anything or quantified in any particular way. Some players just work better together than others and it might not even be a skill level thing; just a general and innate understanding of what the other dude is going to do with the puck, without the puck, on the forecheck, in all three zones — it’s just a thing.
For the Philadelphia Flyers’ newest top-pairing defenseman Ryan Ellis, he views chemistry as being best friends off the ice, and when talking about his new partner Ivan Provorov, he’s attemptin…</span>

 *Training camp is behind up and the preseason starts TOMORROW. Boy that came fast huh?  Here’s a little look the latest from camp. [Flyers]
*Evidently Oskar Lindblom has a new look. That’s fun! [NBC Sports Philly]
*One thing we learned in yesterday’s scrimmage is, apparently, that the new additions to the roster are changing up the special teams a little bit. [Inquirer]
*There’s nothing better than a Charlie Mailbag, and in this one he tackles the Morgan Frost Question and more. [The Athletic]
*Alain Vigneault had some things to say about Claude Giroux heading into the final year of his contract. [NBC Sports Philly]
*Speaking of Cap, the new members of the team know exactly how lucky they are to be playing with someone of Claude Giroux’s caliber. [BSH]
*Anyway, Dave Scott’s excited. [Inquirer]
*Kevin Hayes had some kind words for the hockey community when asked to speak about the untimely death of his brother Jimmy. [The Athletic]
*Ryan Ellis hasn’t played a single game in the Metropolitan Division yet and he’s already figuring to be one of the best defenseman in it. [Pensburgh]
*The league says it will be cracking down on cross-checking this season. Going to be interesting to see how that goes. [ProHockeyTalk]
*And finally, our 25 Under 25 wrapped up with number one Carter Hart, which likely surprised no one and yet probably annoyed some folks anyway. We hope you all had fun with it! [BSH]</span>

A small adventure in an overwhelmingly interesting world
 Many big-budget video games come with a dedicated photo mode these days — a tool designed specifically for capturing a game within a single frame. There’s no real standard for photo modes: Most come with zoom and camera movement, but no two are the same, allowing players to take a breath to capture something with a shutter click. In Toem, developer Something We Made’s game is built around the idea of a photography mode. That’s the whole game.
It’s part of a growing number of photography games that use the act of capturing photos — and noticing environments around the player — as the main function of the game. Before Toem, Umurangi Generation used photography to tell a story of a decaying world; Alba…</span>

 Fans of Microsoft Flight Simulator who play on Xbox Series X will soon have three new controllers to choose from. In addition to the Turtle Beach yoke announced in June, both Thrustmaster and Honeycomb Aeronautical revealed new Xbox-compatible flight control solutions over the weekend. The announcements were made during Flight Sim Expo 2021 in San Diego.
According to FSElite, the Thrustmaster solution will be called the TCA Boeing Yoke Pack, and will be a replica of the controls found in the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. It will include a stand-alone yoke with an all-metal interior structure, plus a separate split throttle. Both will be bundled together in the same box, and b…</span>

Blizzard shows off Bastion and Sombra ability reworks
 Blizzard Entertainment is making some big changes to the heroes of Overwatch for Overwatch 2, including everyone’s favorite point-and-kill turret robot, Bastion. In addition to sporting a baseball cap borrowed from Torbjorn, Bastion’s abilities are being reimagined for Overwatch 2, Blizzard revealed on Saturday evening at the Overwatch League finals.
In the first Overwatch, Bastion could transform from a walking robot (Recon mode) to a stationary turret (Sentry mode), gaining a higher rate of fire and large ammo reserves at the expense of mobility. In Overwatch 2, Bastion will gain the ability to move (albeit at a slower rate) while in turret form. Bastion is also gaining a new ability — a seconda…</span>

                    <span>Apple today said an issue preventing some iPhone 13 users from using the Unlock with Apple Watch feature will be fixed in an upcoming software update.





In a support document, Apple said affected users can turn off Unlock with Apple Watch and use their passcode to unlock their iPhone 13 until the software update is released. The feature, which is designed to let you unlock your iPhone while wearing a mask or ski goggles, can be toggled off in the Settings app under Face ID &amp; Passcode.



Apple did not specify which software update will include a fix, nor did it provide a timeframe. The first beta of iOS 15.1 was released five days ago, but Apple could also choose to release a minor iOS 15.0.1 update with bug fixes.



As we reported, affected users might see an &quot;Unable to Communicate with Apple Watch&quot; error message if they try to unlock their iPhone 13 while wearing a face mask, or they might not be able to set up Unlock with Apple Watch.

A couple free agency acquisitions are stoked as hell.
 Claude Giroux’s contract is on the mind of every single Philadelphia Flyers fan and staff member as they head into an all-important season to show that last year’s tumble down the standings was a fluke. It is the final year of the captain’s eight-year contract extension signed way back in 2013.
And while the contract talk between Flyers GM Chuck Fletcher and Giroux will be had a later date, letting this season play out to determine where to go from here with one of the franchise’s most beloved stars.
The general feeling is not a matter of if they are going to sign him, but for how long and how much. Especially considering just how damn respected he is around his locker room…</span>

                    <span>After developers discovered that their apps are not currently able to use 120Hz ProMotion refresh rates for all animations, there was confusion over whether it was a limitation imposed for battery life or a bug. Apple has now provided clarification.





Apple told MacRumors that all third-party apps can take full advantage of 120Hz ProMotion refresh rates, but developers will need to declare that their apps use higher frame rates by adding an entry to their app&#x27;s plist. Documentation on the required plist entry will be made available to developers soon.



Apple is requiring this opt-in step to provide higher fresh rates only to apps that will benefit from the technology, which will optimize battery life on iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max devices.

                    <span>YouTuber Arun “Mrwhosetheboss” Maini’s full battery life drain test of the iPhone 13 Pro Max, iPhone 13 Pro, iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Mini, iPhone 12, iPhone 11, and iPhone SE. Interesting results that jibe with Apple’s claims about the improvements to battery life in the iPhones 13.
Via Avi Greengart, who observes the most impressive result:
It’s worth watching Arun’s whole video, but the iPhone 13 mini
handily beats last year’s full-sized iPhone 12 on battery life,
making it an easy recommendation for anyone with human-sized
hands. The entire iPhone 13 line has genuinely good to
extraordinary battery life.
The iPhone 13 Mini has longer battery life than last year’s regular iPhone 12. That’s a game-changer for those who want the Mini size.

                    <span>MacOS 12 Monterey is not out yet — and, I hope, won’t ship until after a few more weeks of much-needed bug fixes — but Safari 15 for MacOS 11 Big Sur shipped last week. I strongly recommend not upgrading, unless you’ve already tried the new tab design and like it, or at least feel ambivalent about it. Updates like this are why I always turn off “Automatically keep my Mac up to date” in System Preferences → Software Update.
The sole reason I recommend not upgrading to Safari 15 is the new tab bar design. You can easily try it out for yourself, though, without upgrading to Safari 15 or installing the MacOS 12 betas. Safari Technology Preview is a separate version of Safari you can easily install next to regular Safari. Typically it’s used by web developers to test in-progress changes to WebKit, but right now it’s more useful as a way to preview the new Safari 15 tab design. It’s easy to install and easy to uninstall. You can even set it as your default web browser while testing in System Preferences: General.

                    <span>Laura Olin is right; this recorded lunch conversation with Orson Welles from 1983 is well worth a read. I mean:
Waiter: Gentlemen, bon appétit. How is everything?
O.W.: We’re talking, thank you. [Waiter leaves.] I wish they wouldn’t do that. If I ever own a restaurant, I will never allow the waiters to ask if the diners like their dishes. Particularly when they’re talking.
H.J.: What is wrong with your food?
O.W.: It’s not what I had yesterday.
H.J.: You want to try to explain this to the waiter?
O.W.: No, no, no. One complaint per table is all, unless you want them to spit in the food. Let me tell you a story about George Jean Nathan, America’s great drama critic. Nathan was the tightest man who ever lived, even tighter than Charles Chaplin. And he lived for 40 years in the Hotel Royalton…</span>

                    <span>I don’t know if a 10-second sequence of a plane landing in one of Brian De Palma’s worst films properly qualifies as “The Most Difficult Shot in Movie History”, but the story behind it is genuinely interesting. The logistics of having only 30 seconds out of an entire year to get this exact shot of the setting sun and coordinating that with a landing supersonic jet at one of the world’s busiest airports are certainly daunting. As Patrick Willems notes in his commentary, this shot also signifies the end of an era in the film industry.

                    <span>As part of the Great Green Wall initiative, Senegal has been building circular, drought-resistant gardens to keep the Sahara desert from spreading any further. The Kid Should See This explains how they work:
These Senegalese farmers plant the spiraling gardens with a plan to hold water: Medicinal plants in the inner circle, three rows of vegetables, with fruit and nut trees next. The outer circles are created with large baobab trees and African mahogany trees.

                    <span>The new iPhone 13 Pro models that launched today are equipped with ProMotion display technology, which allows for adaptive refresh rates ranging from 10Hz all the way to 120Hz, which is ideal for scrolling through content, gaming, and more, because it makes for a smoother viewing experience.





Though there&#x27;s a 120Hz maximum refresh rate, App Store developers have found that most app animations are limited to 60Hz, which results in an uneven viewing experience for users. As noted by 9to5Mac, ProMotion works at the full 120Hz for scrolling and full-screen transitions, but animations are limited to 60Hz.



So when you&#x27;re scrolling through your Twitter timeline, for example, you&#x27;ll see the smooth ProMotion experience, but animations at 60Hz mean other interactions are noticeably …</span>

                    <span>With the launch of the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max, Apple introduced Macro mode, a new camera feature that&#x27;s exclusive to the Pro models and brings the immensely detailed world of close-up macro photography to iPhones for the first time. Keep reading to learn how it works.





With Macro mode enabled, you can take pictures or video of subjects that are as close as 2cm to your iPhone&#x27;s camera lens, which means you can now take shots of flowers, textures, insects, or pretty much anything small or at close distance, with accurate focus, rich detail, and no blurring.



Here&#x27;s how to use the Macro mode feature on ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ Max. Bear in mind that Macro mode is exclusive to these models and isn&#x27;t supported on iPhone 13 mini or ‌iPhone 13‌.

Apple&#x27;s ‌iPhone 13‌ models have more environmentally friendly packaging, so you just need to pop open the box and your iPhone is right there with no more protective plastic. There are a few papers, a SIM ejection tool, and a Lightning to USB-C cable. No charger or EarPods, of course, because Apple dropped those last year.

                    <span>Apple this week opened its newest Apple Store in New York City, Apple The Mall at Bay Plaza, which also happens to be the first Apple retail location in the Bronx.





‌Apple Store‌ aficionado Michael Steeber teamed up with Storeteller for a virtual 360-degree walkthrough of the new location, giving us an in-depth look at the features and improvements that Apple has brought to its latest ‌Apple Store‌.



Apple The Mall at Bay Plaza may look similar to most other Apple retail locations, but it has a unique feature - a dedicated Pickup Zone. The Pickup Zone is a permanent installation within the store, featuring a dedicated table where customers can get their new devices from employees and more interestingly, a wall of built-in drawers where all the pickup orders are housed.





In most Apple retail locations, employees must go to the back to retrieve orders that have been placed for in-store pickup, but that won&#x27;t be the case with Apple The Mall at Bay Plaza, and it is the first store with this setup rather than a Forum area.



Along with the Pickup Zone, the store also features an area with round tables for training, and a series of Forum displays. There are leather seats along the walls for those waiting for Genius Bar appointments, and the front of the store is outfitted with sliding glass doors.



Make sure to check out the full store walkthrough to get a feel for the new design.

                    <span>iFixit is gearing up for one of traditional teardowns of the new iPhone 13 models, but ahead of that full teardown, iFixit has done a live event to give us a first glimpse inside the refreshed devices.






As we&#x27;ve seen in prior inside looks, the new iPhones have smaller, square-shaped Taptic Engines, and the iPhone 13 Pro has a smaller, denser logic board than the ‌iPhone 13‌ along with an L-shaped battery and a larger internal camera module.



Battery capacities were unveiled earlier today, and ‌iPhone 13‌ models have larger batteries across the board. The ‌iPhone 13‌ mini has a 2,406 mAh battery, the ‌iPhone 13‌ has a 3,227 mAh battery, the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ has a 3,095 mAh battery, and the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ Max has a 4,352 mAh battery.



iFixit&#x27;s live teardown is interesting for those who want to see a step-by-step deconstruction of the device, but there&#x27;s not a lot of new information to learn at this point. iFixit plans to publish a more in-depth teardown next week, which should give us some more insight on the internal components.

                    <span>For this week&#x27;s giveaway, we&#x27;ve teamed up with Lululook to offer MacRumors readers a chance to win an Urban Magnetic iPad Stand that turns an iPad Pro or an iPad Air into a little iMac for a desktop setup.





As the name suggests, the Urban iPad Stand has a strong built-in magnet that&#x27;s designed to attach to a compatible ‌iPad‌. Like the iPhone and a MagSafe charger, the ‌iPad‌ and the stand automatically align with one another.





Once on the stand, the ‌iPad‌ is at an ideal height to provide an ergonomic viewing experience, and with the adjustable hinge at the back, it can be rotated around 360 degrees to any viewing angle that works best for you. It&#x27;s useful for watching movies, working with a keyboard and mouse, drawing, and more.

                    <span>In 2019, Apple opened its Security Bounty Program to the public, offering payouts up to $1 million to researchers who share critical iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, or watchOS security vulnerabilities with Apple, including the techniques used to exploit them. The program is designed to help Apple keep its software platforms as safe as possible.





In the time since, reports have surfaced indicating that some security researchers are unhappy with the program, and now a security researcher who uses the pseudonym &quot;illusionofchaos&quot; has shared their similarly &quot;frustrating experience.&quot;



In a blog post highlighted by Kosta Eleftheriou, the unnamed security researcher said they reported four zero-day vulnerabilities to Apple between March and May of this year, but they said that three of t…</span>

                    <span>Arun Maini today shared a new iPhone battery life test on his YouTube channel Mrwhosetheboss, timing how long all four iPhone 13 models last on a single charge compared to older iPhone models. Maini said all of the iPhones had 100% battery health and were set to an equivalent brightness, and each iPhone was subjected to the same usage.





While the test is not scientific, and might not perfectly reflect real-world usage, the video still provides us with a good idea of how the new iPhone 13 models stack up to previous generations in terms of battery life.



The winning device in the test was the iPhone 13 Pro Max, which achieved an impressive 9 hours and 52 minutes of battery life with continuous usage. Maini said this is the longest battery life of any iPhone that he has ever …</span>

                    <span>With the launch of the iPhone 13 series, Apple introduced several new camera features that take advantage of the A15 Bionic processor and advanced machine learning. One of these is called Cinematic Mode. This article explains what Cinematic Mode is and how to use it.





What is Cinematic Mode?


Cinematic Mode utilizes Dolby Vision HDR and a technique called &quot;rack focus&quot; to seamlessly shift the focus from one subject to another when you&#x27;re shooting video. It does this by locking the focus on the subject in a scene and blurring the background to achieve depth of field. If you subsequently move the camera to center on a new subject or a new subject enters the scene, Cinematic mode automatically switches the focal point to this new subject and blurs out the background.

As outlined on Reddit, after receiving an ‌iPhone 13‌, some customers cannot toggle on the &quot;Unlock with Apple Watch&quot; feature, allowing users to unlock their iPhones while wearing a mask thanks to their Apple Watch. When attempting to activate the feature, some customers are prompted with an &quot;Unable to communicate with Apple Watch&quot; prompt, with no clear solution.

                    <span>When Apple announced the new iPhone 13 series, it also introduced several new camera features, including Photographic Styles for photos and Cinematic mode for shooting video. In this article, we take a look at what Photographic Styles are and how to use them.





Photographic Styles consist of a series of subtle filter-like adjustments that you can enable before you&#x27;ve taken any photos, allowing you to bring a stylistic effect to your shots beforehand that won&#x27;t affect the skin tone of your subjects. These styles come in four presets: Vibrant, Rich Contrast, Warm, and Cool. 



Vibrant captures the shot in bright, vivid, yet natural-looking colors, while Rich Contrast adds a more dramatic look that makes shadows darker and increases color and contrast. Warm adds a summery golden…</span>

                    <span>Launch day has arrived for all four iPhone 13 models in over 30 countries, marking the start of in-store availability of the devices.





In countries such as the United States, Canada, and the UK, some iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro configurations are available for same-day pickup at select Apple Stores as of the time this story was published. Apple Store pickup is the best option for customers who did not pre-order an iPhone 13 model, as placing an order through Apple&#x27;s online store today could result in a lengthy wait time of 4-6 weeks for delivery.



To check if an iPhone 13 model is available for Apple Store pickup, head to the iPhone 13 or iPhone 13 Pro order page, configure the iPhone as you would like it, and look for a &quot;Pickup&quot; option towards the bottom of the page. A link below the &quot;Pickup&quot; option leads to an iPhone Availability tool, which displays iPhone 13 models available for pickup at nearby Apple Stores based on the zip code or postal code that you enter.



Key features across all four iPhone 13 models include a faster A15 Bionic chip, camera improvements, longer battery life, and a smaller notch. The two Pro models also feature a ProMotion display with a variable refresh rate up to 120Hz, up to 1TB of storage, and additional camera features like Night mode portraits and ProRes video recording.



In the United States, starting prices are the same as they were for the iPhone 12 lineup, including $699 for the iPhone 13 mini, $799 for the iPhone 13, $999 for the iPhone 13 Pro, and $1,099 for the iPhone 13 Pro Max.



The sixth-generation iPad mini and ninth-generation iPad are also available for same-day pickup at select Apple Stores starting today.

The rumor originating from Dylandkt claims that a future version of the ‌iPad Pro‌ will include a horizontal camera layout and a landscape Apple logo on the back. Dylandkt, whose track record is yet to be fully established regarding a plethora of past information about upcoming Macs, said they can&#x27;t fully state when these design changes will be released but said it is &quot;in the works.&quot;



Apple in recent years has started to promote its higher-end ‌iPad Pro‌ as a near laptop replacement when equipped with a keyboard. Currently, the logo on…</span>

During Apple&#x27;s fully-digital &quot;California streaming&quot; event on September 14, which included no physical audience attendance in Cupertino in favor of pre-recorded segments live-streamed, the EFF decided to fly a plane over ‌Apple Park‌ with the message &quot;Apple: Don&#x27;t scan our phones!

                    <span>Sponsorships have been selling briskly this year, but I’ve only just now opened spots for the October-December quarter. Plus, a last-minute change has opened up next week’s spot, starting this coming Monday.
One sponsor per week, with a sponsor-written entry in the RSS feed to start the week, a thank-you post right on the homepage from me at the end, and the one and only graphic ad on every page of the site all week long. No tracking or other privacy-invasive bullshit. Just plain honest ads. That’s not new — that’s the way the ads on DF have always been. My best argument that they work: the number of repeat companies in the sponsor archive list.
So if you’ve got a product or service you’d like to promote to DF’s discerning audience, I’d love to have you as a sponsor. And if you’re ready to grab next week’s opening, let’s go — should be another good week.

                    <span>I shot this video while walking past the Philly Apple Store at 2 pm. The line went most of the way down the block. I’ll bet the line was longer than it would have been without COVID restrictions, but still — this is the 15th generation of iPhones and people are still lining up to buy them on the day they’re available. And how many more people had them delivered today, waking up early a week ago to preorder the moment the online store came online? People love iPhone. If you look at it solely as a technology product you’re missing the biggest part of the iPhone story. iPhone Day is a de facto annual holiday for untold millions of people around the world.
That’s not true of any other product in the world.

                    <span>Alex Kantrowitz, writing for CNBC:
“Just completely running blind” is how Aaron Paul, a performance
Facebook marketer, described it. Paul said his company, Carousel,
moved from spending millions of dollars each day on Facebook to a
few hundred thousand dollars. Before the iOS changes, Facebook
generated 80% of the traffic Carousel sent to its product pages.
Now it accounts for 20%.
Apple’s iOS changes may lead to irreparable harm to Facebook’s ad
business. This moment has demonstrated to Paul and his fellow
performance buyers that relying on one channel (albeit a very
effective one) is risky. So they’re looking to diversify their ad
spend. Paul said he’s moved his ad budget elsewhere, including
“Snapchat and TikTok, but also silent killers like email.” On
Twitter, Facebook marketers discussing Apple’s changes
almost unanimously agreed they needed to follow suit.

                    <span>Jonathan Hoefler:
Nothing’s changing at typography.com, where you’ll still find all
1,113 fonts in the Hoefler&amp;Co library, as well as the
cloud.typography webfont service, and all the other resources
we’ve created for designers and brands. The H&amp;Co team is staying
in place, too, and there are yet more typefaces from us that you
can look forward to seeing soon. […]
In the meantime, I’ll be stepping down from my role in the
company, to finally make the time to recharge, reflect, and
explore some new ideas. In these past few years, participating in
a documentary and using typography to help elect a
president have been potent reminders of just how many ways
there are for type to make a difference, and just how many people
are moved by the splendor of typography.
I’d need 144-point type to express my surprise at this announcement.

Shot on the new iPhone 13 Pro, Float is a short film about the
journey that a father and daughter take together.
If this doesn’t move you, you’re not hooked up right. Good god, what a powerful, lovely, beautiful short film. Headphones and full screen — this deserves your attention. I take it back, Cinematic mode — which Larrow used to shoot this — is no gimmick at all.
This is just astonishing. Remember Aundre Larrow’s name.

                    <span>A bunch of you are probably getting new iPhones (and iPads) today. As someone who’s set up 5 new devices in the last week, my advice is to restore a new iPhone with the Quick Start device-to-device transfer, not iCloud backup. Don’t worry if it says it might take a little longer this way, it’s worth it. Get a cup of coffee or a bite to eat. A watched pot never boils; a watched transfer never finishes.
Device-to-device is better because it moves over all your login credentials. When you restore from an iCloud backup, you wind up logged out of a lot of apps on the new device. When you restore device-to-device, almost everything moves over. I know there are exceptions, but I don’t think I bounced into a single app that didn’t keep me fully logged in this week. If you tried device-to-device a few years ago and found it lacking, try it again now — Apple has improved this process every year since it debuted. Worst case scenario, you can always start over and use iCloud backup.
Also, you do not need to unpair your Apple Watch from your old iPhone using this method. You can just wear your watch the whole time. When the transfer is complete, the new iPhone will prompt you, asking if you want to move your watch to the new iPhone. Your mileage may vary but it just worked for me.
I posted this on Twitter tonight, and realized I should post about this here too. The Twitter thread has a bunch of Q&amp;A’s about specific apps, like authentication tokens in Authy (they transfer fine).

                    <span>Italians who don’t know how to have fun released a new EP! I remember this band since they released their debut 1 sided LP… and must say that new material is f***g amazing! With each new release, the powerviolence of this band becomes stronger and stronger. Don&#x60;t be fooled with such simple cover art… the main hell is inside! When the needle touches that pink (yep the record is pink) surface, uhhh, everything begins. This music is so intensive, fast, and ridiculously angry, damn, I love it!

                    <span>Hello! On Wednesday I was talking to a friend about how it would be cool to
have an nginx playground website where you can just paste in an nginx config
and test it out. And then I realized it might actually be pretty easy to build,
so got excited and started coding and I built it. It’s at
https://nginx-playground.wizardzines.com.
Here’s a screenshot:

For the rest of the post I’m mostly going to talk about how I built the
project, because there were a few decisions that weren’t obvious to me.
how to use it
You need to enter both an nginx config and a curl or http command to make a
HTTP request to that nginx instance
And then you click “Run” in the top right, and it’ll output either:
the results of the command you executed (if nginx started successfully), or

How did Hart’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
So Carter Hart graded out as perhaps the worst starting goaltender in the NHL in 2020-21. 
Now that’s out of the way, we can get into why he’s still the Flyers’ top prospect under 25 years of age by unpacking a bit of what went wrong last season and why the 27-game sample size falls where it does.
We’ve already addressed how bizarre the 2020-2…</span>

News flash: he is good at hockey. 
 No. 2: Joel Farabee
2020-21 League/Team(s): Philadelphia Flyers (NHL)
2020-21 Statistics: 55 GP, 20 G, 18 A, 38 PTS

How did Farabee’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
This quote from our season review of Farabee is quite telling of his 2020-21 season:
If one considers Farabee’s rookie season a success, comparatively in a year devoid of standout performances, his sophomore season is a highlight. At just twenty years old, playing in the top six, it appears that only the sky is the limit for the Syracuse native.

He led the Flyers, and the league for…</span>

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *Training camp is in full swing now and thankfully we have Charlie to take us inside and look at how the players are being grouped as the roster begins to take shape. [The Athletic]
*If nothing else, training camp is when lingering questions begin to be answered heading into the season. It’s going to be a fun couple of weeks. [Inquirer]
*Like the rest of us, Alain Vigneault isn’t interested in talking about last season anymore. It’s This Season now. [NBC Sports Philly]
*The 25 Under 25 is coming to a close, which means we are getting to the Big Boys. Morgan Frost has a big time opportunity to make himself a roster regular this year, and he clocked in at number five. [BSH]
*Despite a down year, Travis Konecny still made it all the way to number four. [BSH]
*And at number three, Ivan Provorov. We’ll find out which player took the top spot today; place your bets! [BSH]
*Conjuring up Lindros-related flashbacks yesterday, the ridiculous Buffalo Sabres organization stripped the C from Jack Eichel after he failed to pass his physical. Which he didn’t pass because they won’t let him fix his neck. What a mess up there. [Die By The Blade]
*We know the Flyers’ goalie situation; let’s look around the Metro and see what everyone else is working with. [Canes Country]
*DGB has released his Bizarro-Meter rankings for the Eastern Conference. Take a guess what he’s deemed the weirdest thing the Flyers did this offseason. [The Athletic]
*And finally, as always, a new BSH Radio for your Friday! [BSH]</span>

Chai Latte Cupcakes with Caramel Brûlée Frosting. Autumn in a sweet cupcake, and so good! Extra sweet, chai-spiced cupcakes made with warming spices and brown sugar.

If you haven’t played Aria of Sorrow yet, now is the time
 I adore Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. It defined the Metroidvania genre, and no other Castlevania game has ever topped its enormous scope. And yet, when people ask me for my favorite game in the series, I don’t point to a symphony — I point to an aria.
Each of the three Game Boy Advance Castlevania games were inspired by the exploration-first gameplay of Symphony of the Night, to varying degrees of success. Of those first two games, 2001’s Circle of the Moon handily bests 2002’s Harmony of Dissonance, but neither could hold a whippable candle to the PlayStation inspiration that came before. They are enjoyable, even today, but they’re not games I often relish returning to. In hindsight, it tu…</span>

Pixel artist Lux redesigned 80 meal sprites
 Food has always been cute in Stardew Valley, the popular farming sim developed by Eric Barone. A new food mod adds more realistic, charming details to Stardew Valley’s meal sprites, and puts them in an isometric perspective. The mod designer, who goes by Lux on Twitter, has redesigned 80 of Stardew Valley’s cooked meal items. And while the classic sprites have always looked cheery, this is the first time I’ve seen a mod that makes me literally want to eat these meals — especially given the, erm, interesting way you acquire some of them.

An old game, mastered by dedicated players
 The scene in front of me is hectic. There are hundreds of people crowded together in a valley, gathering in a chokepoint that leads to a winter pass. They’ve been waiting there for hours, and they will be waiting for hours more, hoping for a chance to fight a big bad boss. These people aren’t united in that goal — in fact, it’s a competition, and one that requires an absurd amount of time, focus, and dedication. But they are united in doing it for a worthy cause.
In an ongoing series of back-and-forth battles, hundreds of people have assembled on a private server of EverQuest to raise funds for a family devastated by Hurricane Ida. The family’s home sustained major flood damage, and the money will be used to “purcha…</span>

                    <span>The Diamond is a contemplative short documentary by Caitlyn Greene about the people who look for diamonds in an ancient volcanic crater at the Crater of Diamonds State Park in Arkansas. Whatever you find there, you can keep. But what are they really searching for?
I came across an article about the Crater of Diamonds State Park in Arkansas, which I learned is the world’s only public diamond-bearing site. People from all walks of life search for diamonds atop this ancient volcanic crater, and it’s finders keepers. Some people find substantial diamonds, some don’t, and either way, it takes a lot of digging in the dirt. I was immediately hooked on the metaphor of this place.
I was interested in the hope of treasure, the grittiness of searching, and what people there were actually looking for in their lives. Creatively, I wanted to push an interview-driven piece, especially one in which subjects are given freedom to take you where they want to go, rather than guiding interviews along a plot-driven track. Errol Morris’ Vernon, Florida was a huge inspiration for this approach.


That loudspeaker announcement right at the beginning is surreal — a great way to set the tone for the rest of the film.

                    <span>Marcella Giulia Pace photographed the Moon in 48 different hues and arranged them in a lovely spiral pattern.
I have collected some of my Full Moon shots taken over the past 10 years. I selected the shades of color with which the Moon was filmed in front of my lens and my eyes.
The atmosphere gives different colors to our satellite (scattering) based on its height with respect to the horizon, based on the presence of humidity or suspended dust. The shape of the Moon also changes: at the bottom of the horizon, refraction compresses the lunar disk at the poles and makes it look like an ellipse.

                    <span>Ice Ball is a short documentary that follows legendary polar explorer Will Steger and the community that he’s built up around harvesting ice from frozen winter lakes near Ely in northern Minnesota. Steger lives off the grid and uses the harvested ice for refrigeration — the ice keeps everything cool in the ice house for the whole year, until the next harvest.
Best known for his legendary polar explorations, Will Steger’s life work grew out of a single log cabin he built after moving to the Minnesotan wilderness at age 25. Reliant on sustainable energy and natural commodities, Steger formed a community and culture based on the principle of mutuality. Central to Steger’s operation is the lost art of cutting ice for refrigeration. This annual harvest formed a tradition spanning fifty years that became known as the “Ice Ball”. While this old world technology inevitably became obsolete, its disappearance parallels a concerning loss of social interdependence in modern society.


Come for the ice harvesting, stay for the wonderful Minnesotan accents. (via colossal)

                    <span>In this video, Michael Pollan explains how caffeine is woven into the fabric of modern society. Here’s the short version of how that came to be: People used to drink a lot of alcohol because water was unsafe, so folks were often in a sort of low-grade stupor. When coffee hit Europe, it provided the stimulation, focus, and energy necessary for people to work better and longer. Voila, the Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution.
You can read more about caffeine in Pollan’s latest book This Is Your Mind on Plants (excerpt here) or in his 2020 audiobook called Caffeine: How Caffeine Created the Modern World.

The best way to extract the most out of the smallest iPad is to
think of it as a device enhanced by non-keyboard input methods — Scribble with Pencil, snapping photos with the cameras, or
using Siri/voice input. The improved “Scribble” allows you to
make notes, do quick searches, and even find directions. It is a
very addictive way to use the iPad, especially in the smaller
size. […]
The more I use the device, the more I realize that most computing
has been defined by a singular idea of work and productivity.
Mobile devices have and will continue to redefine our work. In the
past, most of the computing involved being in the office. Now,
non-office tasks have access to computing resources and thus offer
an opportunity to make them more productive. Devices like the iPad

I had the opportunity to see the new @surface devices live … and I
am so glad I did.
Holding #SurfaceDuo in my hand, seeing the clever case that
secures the #SurfacePen that looks like a finish rather than a
case not adding any thickness, the fluidity of the screen and
the clever gaming controls…. Very much looking forward to giving
it a spin!
Amen to this enthusiasm for seeing the product introduction live. I get it why Apple did not hold an in-person press event last week — iPhone events are huge, and while I think small events can safely be held in person now, there’s no practical way to shrink the iPhone event.
I miss having hands-on time with new devices as soon as keynotes end. You pick up on things immediately: that something is heavier or lighter than you expected. That certain colors or finishes look different. Remember the Jet Black iPhone 7? You had to see it in person to understand how it looked. And I miss in-person briefings, both official ones and unofficial. In-person communication simply cannot be beaten for conveying subtlety.
Product reviews are hampered too. With in-person Apple events, most reviewers get kit in the hours after the keynote ends. With virtual Apple events, the kit ships for delivery the next day. An extra day makes a big difference when the review embargo drops just one week after the event.

                    <span>Nice supercut video from The Verge squeezing Microsoft’s Surface event yesterday into eight minutes. A few thoughts:
It seems like Microsoft is letting the Surface division stand on its own, brand-wise. They’re not distancing themselves from Microsoft in any way, but branding-wise they’re just letting the products be the “Surface Whatever”, not the “Microsoft Surface Whatever”. There’s even a moment in the event, regarding the folding Duo 2 phone, when a guy says it has “the most precise and reliable hinge mechanism ever engineered at Surface”. I.e. that it was “Surface” who engineered that hinge, not “Microsoft”. I think Surface works as a Microsoft sub-brand like that.
Speaking of the Surface Duo 2 — their folding phone with two screens — they’re now just calling it what they should have called it all along: a phone. It’s a very interesting and unique form factor, but it’s a big folding phone, not a small folding tablet. It supposedly has real cameras this time, too. Starting price: $1,500.
The new Surface Laptop Studio looks really dumb to me. I don’t understand why one would ever want to use it in either of the new folding positions. I guess maybe if you really want to draw on it, you might want to fold it flat, but if you really want to draw that much, why not buy the Surface Pro 8 that detaches from the keyboard? This design just seems dumb.
The Surface Slim Pen 2 introduces haptic feedback, to simulate the feel of a pen on paper. I love stuff like that.

                    <span>Joe Rossignol, reporting for MacRumors:
Apple Watch Series 7 models are equipped with a new module that
enables 60.5GHz wireless data transfer, according to FCC
filings viewed by MacRumors, but this functionality may be
reserved for Apple’s internal use only for now.
The filings indicate that the 60.5GHz module is only activated
when the Apple Watch is placed on a proprietary magnetic dock with
a corresponding 60.5GHz module, but this dock will likely be
reserved for use by Apple employees. For example, it’s possible
that Apple Stores might use the dock to wirelessly restore an
Apple Watch, and if so, it will be interesting to see if Series 7
models still have a hidden diagnostic port for wired connectivity.
This is a little interesting in and of itself. But if you look at the long-term trend, it’s a sign that Apple — along with the rest of the industry — is moving toward wireless technology for both charging and data transfer. Apple Watch exemplifies that — it’s never had a port, either for charging or data. There’s a diagnostic port hidden inside the bottom channel for the watch strap, but those diagnostics are neither charging nor data.
It’s long been my guess that iPhone is never going to support USB-C. I think it’s Apple’s intention to go straight from Lightning to wireless/inductive, with no “port”. Portless is the future for all devices. Yet the product design geniuses at the European Commission want to mandate all devices have one specific port in 2024 and indefinitely thereafter — a port that by that time will already be 10 years old.

The European Union unveiled plans on Thursday to make USB-C
connectors the standard charging port for all smartphones, tablets

that it says will reduce environmental waste but that is likely to
hit Apple the hardest.
The move would represent a long-awaited yet aggressive step into
product-making decisions by the European Commission, the bloc’s
executive arm. Apple, whose iPhones are equipped with a different
port, has long opposed the plan, arguing that it would stifle
innovation and lead to more electronic waste as all current
chargers that are not USB-C would become obsolete. […]

                    <span>No big deal — just a safari expedition to Tanzania. Lions, leopards, giraffes. Ultra wide angle 4K 60 video shot from an iPhone 13 Pro mounted to a helicopter. Your typical iPhone camera review.
The review starts with a terrific movie — including some truly pro-looking Cinematic mode shots — by Taylor McKay.
I thought this was a pretty interesting observation from Mann:
Although the iPhone 13 Pro still only has three lenses, the
addition of macro capability is like adding a new lens altogether,
and for the serious photographer I think it’s perhaps the
strongest advancement in this year’s camera system. […]
Photographer or not, you’ve seen the big and heavy backpacks
photographers carry with them on every shoot. Whether it’s local
or international, we lug these bags full of lenses around because
each one offers a new perspective on whatever story it is that
we’re telling.
As a photographer passionate about the natural world, I carry a
macro lens with me no matter what project I’m working on, just
because I never know what tiny detail of interest might present
itself. Now with the macro capability of the iPhone 13 Pro, I feel
like I have my “in-a-pinch” macro shots covered and I can leave
the rarely-used macro lens at home.
Everything you see in this video was shot with a $1,000 device meant to fit in your pocket.
Some great iOS 15 tips from Mann, too, including using the new Focus feature to create a custom “Shoot Mode” with no notifications whenever he’s using the Camera app or Halide. Also, Mann’s custom Photographic Style settings.

                    <span>Great interview by Matthew Panzarino with Apple vice president Kaiann Drance and human interface designer Johnnie Manzari from Apple’s Camera team:
That’s not even counting tracking shots, where a focus puller is
continually adjusting focus as the camera moves and even the
subject moves in relation to the camera. It’s a highly skilled
operation. To pull off a tracking shot, a focus puller must
practice and train extensively for years. This, Manzari says, is
where Apple sees an opportunity.
“We feel like this is the kind of thing that Apple tackles the
best. To take something difficult and conventionally hard to
learn, and then turn it into something automatic and simple.”
So the team started working through the technical problems in
finding focus, locking focus and racking focus. And these…</span>

                    <span>Judd Legum, writing at Popular Information:
On Friday, CEO Tim Cook answered a question about Apple’s stance
on the Texas ban at an all-staff meeting. Cook said that “the
company was looking into whether it could aid the legal fight
against the new law.”
Apple has considerable leverage over the abortion debate in Texas
and across the country — but it is not related to its ability to
pay for lawyers. Apple’s leverage rests in its status as a major
employer and driver of economic growth.
If Apple believes that its employees should be able to “make their
own decisions regarding their reproductive health,” it could
publicly state that it will not expand its workforce in states
that limit abortion rights. That would have a major influence not
only in Texas but in numerous states considering following Texas’
lead.
Last week, TechCrunch published the text of a company-wide memo posted to an internal Apple message board regarding Texas’s near-outlawing of abortion. It began:
A message about women’s reproductive health care
At Apple, we support our employees’ rights to make their own
decisions regarding their reproductive health.
Legum is right — it’s untenable for Apple, or any other company, to “support our employees’ rights to make their own decisions regarding their reproductive health” and ask any woman to work for the company in a state with a law like Texas’s. An immediate hiring and construction freeze in Texas — explicitly tied to this outrageous law (which makes no exceptions for rape or incest) — is the only tenable action compatible with Apple’s stated values.
David Simon, linking to Legum’s post:
If an employer, this is beyond politics. I’m turning in scripts
next month on an HBO non-fiction miniseries based on events in
Texas, but I can’t and won’t ask female cast/crew to forgo civil
liberties to film there. What else looks like Dallas/Ft. Worth?
That’s the answer. You move your business out of Texas. Any company that expands or initiates new operations in Texas implicitly supports Texas’s abortion ban.

How did Provorov’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
Provorov had a letdown after losing defensive partner Matt Niskanen to retirement, never really finding his rhythm and looking like the possibly transformative defender that everybody hoped he became in 2019-20.

How did Konecny’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
TK didn’t have a stellar 2020-21, continuing a downward trend that began in the COVID-19 bubble playoffs. After a huge breakout via leading the team in points, fans expected Konecny to produce like a top line player, and he failed to deliver anything outside of the odd offensive explosion. There are caveats behind why his performance wasn’t up to the lofty predictions 2019-20 warranted, but all the same…</span>

How did Frost’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
Everybody’s favorite Soo Greyhounds product had a difficult year in the pandemic.

Today’s open discussion thread, complete with your daily dose of Flyers news and notes…  
 *Training Camp Day is upon us, pals. The excitement is palpable. Say hello to the newest Flyers, Jon-Randall Avon! The Flyers gave him an ELC yesterday. [Flyers]
*If you, like many, are saying to yourself, “Whomst?” fear not! Here’s some insight into who this guy is. [NBC Sports Philly]
*This new guy almost certainly won’t figure into the mix, but with all of these preseason injuries, it’ll be interesting to see who steps up to fill those holes. [BSH]
*Sammy took a stab at trying to figure it out. [Inquirer]
*Always an outstanding read, Charlie’s state of the franchise report asks the question: is this a team poised to be Actually Good again? [The Athletic]
*25 Under 25 rundown! One of the newer draftees found himself quite high on this year’s list at number eight. [BSH]
*At seven, everyone’s current favorite rookie, Wade Allison. [BSH]
*And juuuuust short of the top five, promising young ginger defenseman Cam York. [BSH]
*Let’s take a look around the Metro Division’ defense corps, see what we are working with here. [Canes Country]
*And finally, speaking of the Metro, if you’re making a list of the top-15 forwards in it, is Sean Couturier the only Flyer that makes the list? Hmm. [Pensburgh]</span>

                    <span>Within the past 50 years, the global community has solved two huge problems that had the potential to harm every person on Earth. Smallpox once killed 30% of the people who contracted the disease but through the invention of an effective, safe vaccine and an intense effort that began in the 1960s, smallpox was completely eradicated by 1980. In the 1980s, scientists discovered a hole in the ozone layer that protects the Earth from UV radiation; further depletion would have caused major problems with the world’s food supply and an epidemic of skin cancer. Forty years later, we’ve virtually eliminated the chemicals causing the depletion and ozone losses have stabilized and have recently shown improvement.
So how did we do it? The short video above talks through each of challenges, how they were met (science + politics + a bit of luck), and how we might apply these lessons to the big problems of today (climate emergency, the pandemic).

                    <span>This is a lovely, almost poetic piece by Daniel Riley about the sport of freediving and one of the best freedivers in the world, Alexey Molchanov.
Freediving is, after all, a lifelong opportunity to radically reshape one’s body and mind in the process. In pursuing depth, humans must train their lungs and brains to unlock secret sources of clarity and strength and oxygen and potential that are hidden within the body. They are secrets that, once revealed, make the divers not just more effective at their craft, they argue, but more effective, conscious, skillful, and thoughtful as human beings. There is a shift in perspective. A global realignment within one’s consciousness. The look in their eyes when they talk about this thing…every diver who’s gone truly deep sounds like those rarest of in…</span>

                    <span>With iOS 15, Apple introduced a new design and a range of new features, including better support for extensions. Safari in ‌iOS 15‌ supports web extensions, which can be downloaded and installed through the App Store, so there are a much wider range of extension options for you to choose from.





We&#x27;ve rounded up some of the most useful ‌iOS 15‌ extensions that we&#x27;ve found so far.



 
1Password (Subscription Required) - For 1Password users, the 1Password extension allows users to input their saved 1Password information in Safari, similar to how it works on the Mac. 1Password can autofill logins, passwords, credit card information, two-factor authentication codes, and more. A 1Password subscription is required, which is priced at $2.99 per month.

                    <span>Apple is planning to give its Apple Store employees one-time bonuses amounting to up to $1,000, reports Bloomberg. The bonuses will be provided to employees who have been working during the ongoing global health crisis.





Retail employees who were hired before March 31, 2021 will be given $1,000, and employees who joined after that date will be given $500. Employees hired for the holiday shopping season will get $200. Apple plans to provide the bonuses to those who work in retail stores, those who do online sales, and AppleCare staff.



Apple does not often give bonuses to its retail staff. The last bonus went out in 2018 when Apple granted $2,500 in restricted stock units to most of its employees, including those working at Apple Stores. The bonuses were handed out after the introduction of new U.S. tax laws and were given to most employees below a director level.



The $1,000 bonuses will be provided as paychecks rather than as stock units like the prior bonus and are designed as a thank you to employees for their efforts during the pandemic.

                    <span>Microsoft today announced several new additions to its Surface lineup, introducing an updated high-end Surface Laptop and a revised version of its Surface Duo foldable smartphone.






The Surface Laptop Studio is Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;most powerful Surface&quot; to date, and it replaces the Surface Book line of laptops. Rather than a removable display like prior models, Microsoft has adopted a design that looks rather similar to Apple&#x27;s Magic Keyboard. The 14.4-inch display lifts up and can be pulled forward into a tablet mode.





There are actually a total of three modes: laptop, stage, and studio. Laptop looks like a standard laptop computer, while stage is a middle tier mode that allows the display to be pulled forward at an angle for gaming and watching movies, and studio, which is a…</span>

                    <span>Apple today seeded the first public betas of upcoming iOS 15.1 and iPadOS 15.1 betas, one day after seeding the first betas to developers and just a couple days after releasing iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 to the public.





Public beta testers who have signed up for Apple&#x27;s beta testing program can download the iOS and ‌iPadOS 15.1‌ updates over the air after installing the proper certificate from the Public Beta website.



SharePlay makes a return in iOS 15.1, with Apple once again testing the feature that was removed before the launch of iOS 15. SharePlay is designed to let users call their friends and family and interact by watching movies, watching TV, or listening to music together.



Apple has added features like shared playlists and TV show syncing so everyone sees the same thing at the same time. SharePlay also has a built-in screen sharing feature, and Apple is still working out the bugs.



Paired with the HomePod 15.1 beta (which is invite only), iOS 15.1 adds Lossless Audio and Dolby Atmos with Spatial Audio support to the ‌HomePod‌ and the HomePod mini, bringing Apple&#x27;s speakers in line with iPhones, iPads, and Macs.



iPhone users who have a health care provider or state record that uses SMART Health Cards can import their COVID-19 vaccination records into the Health app and can then add a vaccine card to the Wallet app. This is an opt-in feature that uses a global specification, but healthcare providers need to implement it.



Right now, Smart Health Cards are or will be available to those in California, Louisiana, New York, Virginia, Hawaii, and some Maryland counties, as well those who were vaccinated at Walmart, Sam&#x27;s Club, and CVS Health. Healthcare providers like electronic health record vendors like Epic and Cerner also support Smart Health Cards.

                    <span>Apple today seeded a new public beta of the macOS 12 Monterey beta to public beta testers, allowing non-developers to test the new macOS Monterey software ahead of its public release. 





Public beta testers can download the macOS 12 Monterey update from the Software Update section of the System Preferences app after installing the proper profile from Apple&#x27;s beta software website.



‌macOS Monterey‌ introduces quite a few major updates for the macOS operating system. When released, Universal Control will let a single mouse, trackpad, and keyboard be used across multiple Mac or iPad devices, and it&#x27;s now possible to AirPlay directly to a Mac from an iPhone, ‌iPad‌, or even another Mac.

                    <span>Apple has no plans to allow Fortnite to return to the App Store in the near future, Apple&#x27;s lawyers told Epic&#x27;s lawyers this week. Further, Apple does not plan to consider requests for the reinstatement of the Epic Games developer account until the court&#x27;s judgment is &quot;final and nonappealable,&quot; a process that could span years.





Apple provided this information to ‌Epic Games‌ after Epic CEO Tim Sweeney emailed Apple&#x27;s Phil Schiller and asked for the ‌Epic Games‌ developer account to be reinstated. Sweeney said that Epic would adhere to Apple&#x27;s guidelines &quot;whenever and wherever&quot; products were released on Apple&#x27;s platforms, but he went on to explain that Epic would only reinstate Fortnite if Apple adheres to the &quot;plain language of the court order&quot; and allows apps to &quot;include buttons…</span>

Mann said that macro mode, which uses the Ultra Wide lens and allows users to take photos around 2cm away from a subject, is &quot;perhaps the strongest advancement in this year&#x27;s camera system&quot; and fulfills a clear need for many photographers.

As an overall take, CNET&#x27;s Scott Stein argues that the &quot;good enough&quot; entry-level ‌iPad‌ actually &quot;covers all the bases best&quot; out of Apple&#x27;s entire ‌iPad‌ lineup at the moment.



Stein notes that iPads are most often secondary devices and especially popular with families, and pricing on the entry-level ‌iPad‌ makes it a compelling product that offers much of the functionality people are looking for in an ‌iPad‌ without breaking the bank.

                    <span>Apple released iOS 15 on Monday, and in the time since, the software update has reportedly seen lower adoption than iOS 14 following its launch last year.





According to analytics company Mixpanel, around 8.5% of users installed iOS 15 as of Wednesday at 12:00 a.m. Eastern Time, compared to around 14.5% for iOS 14 as of midnight on the second day after that software update was released.



Mixpanel measures iOS adoption based on visits to websites and apps that use its mobile analytics SDKs, so the data is not official. Apple has yet to share iOS 15 adoption stats, having last reported an 85% adoption rate for iOS 14 back in June.



Earlier this year, Apple announced that iPhone users who remain on iOS 14 now have the option to continue receiving important security updates, so this change is likely contributing to iOS 15&#x27;s lower adoption rate seen by Mixpanel so far.

                    <span>Apple CEO Tim Cook has warned employees about leaking company information, in a leaked memo seen by The Verge.





Last week, discussions from a private all-hands town hall meeting were leaked to the press, revealing the company&#x27;s stances on issues such as working from home and the Apple vs. Epic legal battle going forwards.



Last night, Cook emailed employees to address the contents of that meeting being leaked, admonishing those who revealed the details of the discussions to the press, but now that email has also been leaked to The Verge. The internal email sent by Cook reads:
Dear Team,

                    <span>The sixth-generation iPad mini will begin arriving to customers and launch in stores this Friday, September 24, and ahead of time, reviews of the device have now been shared by several tech websites and YouTube channels.





We&#x27;ve already rounded up video reviews of the new iPad mini, and we&#x27;ve shared some highlights from additional reviews below.









The consensus among reviews is that the new iPad mini is more like an iPad Air mini, as the two devices now share several features, including slimmer bezels, a USB-C port, a Touch ID power button, a 12-megapixel rear Wide camera, and compatibility with the second-generation Apple Pencil. The new iPad mini actually goes a step beyond the iPad Air with Apple&#x27;s latest A15 Bionic chip, 5G on cellular models, and Center Stage s…</span>

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/22/apple-ar-headset-production-second-quarter-2022/">

                    <span>Apple&#x27;s augmented reality headset will enter mass production in the second quarter of next year, with a launch expected between the third and fourth quarter of 2022, according to a translated report from the Taiwanese version of DigiTimes.





In June, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo offered a similar timeline for Apple&#x27;s AR headset, reporting it will launch sometime between April and June of next year. According to today&#x27;s report, Apple&#x27;s AR headset has completed its second phase of prototype testing, inching closer to being ready for primetime mass production.



The first iteration of Apple&#x27;s AR headset may be a bit bulky in design, similar to the Oculus Rift headset, but a sleeker pair of &quot;Apple Glasses&quot; could launch a few years later. In recent years, Apple has been building up its AR platform, rolling out several AR-centric features on iOS and iPadOS, possibly paving the way for the &quot;‌Apple Glasses‌.&quot;



Apple&#x27;s AR headset isn&#x27;t expected to be cheap in price, at least at the start. One report says that it will feature at least 15 camera modules, feature eye-tracking, possibly iris recognition, and could cost between $2,000 and $3,000.

                    <span>Ben Bajarin, writing at Creative Strategies:
While I will admit there is a small percentage of Apple customers
who upgrade every year and a percentage more who upgrade every two
years because they are on upgrade plans, the vast majority of
consumers upgrade every 3-4 years. I thought it would be
interesting to look at some basic iPhone benchmarks through the
years and look at how much performance improvement happens every
four years.
Incremental improvements every year turn into profound improvements over 3–4 years. It’s like the technology version of compound interest. It adds up.
As I benchmarked the A15 Bionic in different ways and pondered how
Apple spends its transistor budget with each A-series chip cycle,
an interesting shift emerged for iPhone 13. Going back to how
Apple spends their transistor budget on features, not necessarily
performance, for the A15, Apple looks to have had the most GPU
gains YoY since the A9. For the past five years, Apple has had an
average of 19% GPU gains YoY but for the A15 Bionic, Apple has
increased GPU performance by 52%.
This intentional increase in GPU performance over CPU performance
speaks to the more graphically intense features Apple had in mind
for iPhone 13 that is demonstrated in things like macro
photography, macro video, and Cinematic Mode. Developers also now
have a dramatically increased GPU at their disposal to create new
app experiences around and can leverage new augmented reality
techniques, visual computing and AI, and more.
It’s almost enough to make one think that Apple is ready to release high-end professional Macs built around Apple GPUs.

Went hands on with the iPhone 13 Pro and immediately wanted to
test out the camera and cinematic mode. It’s limited to 1080p
30fps but I was surprised to see how sharp it was AND that it
retained Dolby Vision.
Interesting to see Cinematic mode in the hands of a talented videographer. Easily the best “in the wild” Cinematic mode video I’ve seen. (Explicit lyrics in the song.)

                    <span>From Wired’s review of the iPhone 4S:
Apple never specified what the “S” stands for in iPhone 4S, and it
may as well stand for Siri. Sure, the fifth-generation iPhone’s
superb camera and speedy dual-core processor are classy additions.
But Siri is the reason people should buy this phone. […]
The iPhone 4S looks exactly the same as its predecessor — but who
cares? If it was shaped even slightly differently or came in a new
color, people would still go nuts over the stuff that’s more
important anyway: the insides. And both inside and out, this is a
magnificent smartphone.
The late Steve Jobs once called the computer the equivalent of a
bicycle for our minds. I think of the smartphone as the rocket
ship for our minds. With increasingly powerful sensors and
technologies, and access to hundreds of thousands of apps enabling
us to do just about anything, the iPhone keeps soaring to
incredible heights and taking us to places with limitless
potential. I guess that’s what you have to do to create a ding in
the universe.
I don’t know what happened to the fellow who wrote this review 10 years ago, but The New York Times could sure use a personal tech critic with this sort of enthusiasm and insight into the way that incremental improvements aggregate in just a few years in profound ways.

in UK is close to 50%. All these share numbers are higher than
ever. Over 14% of US and 10% of UK survey respondents have
switched to an iPhone in the past two years.
I was not aware that churn was so strongly in the favor of iPhone over the last two years. Pretty good for a phone that Henry Blodget declared “dead in the water” in 2012. The downside to this trend, if it continues, is Apple might start running into being deemed an actual monopolist — by which I mean holding a monopoly share of phones p…</span>

                    <span>Nilay Patel, on Brian X. Chen’s iPhone 13 review for Pravda The New York Times:
The NYT does not believe regular people stand to benefit from
better iPhone photos in the dark. I live for this review from
another planet every year.
I thought this was a really strange passage too. Quoting from Chen’s review:
So in summary, the iPhone 13 cameras are slightly better than
those of last year’s iPhones. Even compared with iPhones from
three years ago, the cameras are much better only if you care
about taking nice photos in the dark.
Just how important is night photography? I posed the question to
Jim Wilson, a longtime staff photographer for The New York Times,
as he was taking pictures of the new iPhones for this review. He
said it would be a crucial feature for people like him, but not as

The Flyers have already caught the injury bug before the season begins.
 The Philadelphia Flyers are not starting their season with the best footing. After a summer full of transition and the result being the most shaken-up roster amidst the 32 NHL squads, they announced on Tuesday that they will be dropping the puck on Oct. 15 against the Vancouver Canucks without center Kevin Hayes, as well as depth blueliner Sam Morin, and roster hopeful Wade Allison.
All three of them will be away from the lineup for a significant amount of time – Allison being labelled as “out indefinitely – but the Flyers are purely hoping that the roster that GM Chuck Fletcher spent so much time on during the last few months tinkering with, can be able to withstan…</span>

He especially looked good in the Flyers’ rookie game against the Rangers. 
 No. 8: Tyson Foerster
2020-21 League/Team(s): Lehigh Valley Phantoms (AHL)
2020-21 Statistics: 24 GP, 10 G, 7 A, 17 PTS
Age: 19

How did Foerster’s 2020-21 hockey season go? Is his stock trending up or down from where it was entering the year?
Similarly to Zayde Wisdom, Foerster was called up to the AHL due to the uncertainty of the OHL season, and equally, Foerster impressed. His goal total of ten ranked him second among Phantoms skaters, and to play so well at only 18 in a professional league speaks volumes for Foerster’s potential.

Here’s a rough idea of when Festival of the Lost, The Dawning, Bungie’s 30th Anniversary Event, and Moments of Triumph will appear in Destiny 2
 After four weeks of Destiny 2’s Season of the Lost, Bungie finally launched the calendar and roadmap for the game’s current season. But unlike previous schedules, which listed out the exact dates for events and quests, Season of the Lost’s calendar roadmap is surprisingly sparse. 
Season of the Lost is already in a unique position. Due to The Witch Queen’s delay earlier this year, Season of the Lost will run from August of this year to Feb. 22, 2022. That’s a six month season, where seasons like Splicer and Chosen traditionally last for only three. With the long season, Bungie has a lot of seasonal events to cram into Season…</span>

Apple could keep Fortnite off Mac and iOS for five years
 Following a ruling in Fortnite creator Epic Games’ lawsuit against Apple, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney says Apple will blacklist Fortnite from its ecosystem until its appeals process makes the judgment final.
“Apple lied,” Sweeney said on Twitter. “Apple spent a year telling the world, the court, and the press they’d ‘welcome Epic’s return to the App Store if they agree to play by the same rules as everyone else.’ Epic agreed, and now Apple has reneged in another abuse of its monopoly power over a billion users.”
Sweeney said that Apple’s decision could keep Fortnite off iOS and Mac platforms for as long as five years as the appeals process plays out.
Though Epic Games has appealed the court’s ruling in the Apple …</span>

Two kits and a large number of item variants
 The Sims 4’s Dream Home Decorator game pack did a lot for players interested in home renovation and design, but a new base game update published Tuesday is, arguably, a much bigger deal.
Developer Maxis added two new kits to The Sims 4: Fashion Street and Incheon Arrivals, inspired by India and South Korea, respectively. Most of the stuff in these kits is available only if players buy them, but Maxis added a new, free base game update, too. And it’s an update that’s been a long time coming — expert Sims builders have been asking for this level of customization for some time now. The Sims 4 art team added around 1,200 new item variants to 149 base game items in Build Mode, publisher Electronic Arts said in an update on The Sims 4 website. To put it simply, 149 items now have a massive selection of different color and pattern swatches, which means that you can make things match in new ways. Curtains! Wood swatches that match! Colorful stoves!
The full list of items is available on The Sims 4 blog. In particular, I’m getting real Ironwood Kitchenette vibes from the new VAULT Modular kitchen set.

It’s not only inside stuff, either: There are new swatches for gardening, as well as plants themselves, plus all 64 base game windows have been updated, too. It’s overwhelming and very exciting — there’s so much room for deeper customization with these additional swatches. Of course, it’s no Create a Style, which let The Sims 3 players fully customize object patterns and colors.
Still, it’s a step closer.</span>

It’s called Threads of Light
 Fashion is power in Destiny 2, but players are interested in more than just pure stats. Sure, players want armor and other gear that’ll make their characters more powerful — but plenty of players place equal importance on just how dang good they look. Since Destiny, fashionable players have been convening in the /r/DestinyFashion subreddit, where players share their best looks and how they acquired them — a process that sometimes means a major grind.
Destiny 2 developer Bungie has clearly noticed the appeal of a stylish guardian, and to honor that, it’s creating a digital fashion magazine featuring looks from the game. Called Threads of Light, the magazine is for “celebrating [the] community’s creativity and showcasing the best guardian …</span>

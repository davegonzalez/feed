Apple legal battle, Epic was last week ordered by the court to pay 30 percent of the revenue that it collected from the Fortnite app using its illicit direct payment option.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBack at the start of the dispute between Epic and Apple, Epic added a direct purchase option to the Fortnite app, skirting Apple's in-app purchase rules. This violation of Apple's App Store guidelines led Apple to pull Fortnite from the App Store, and directly after that, Epic filed its pre-planned lawsuit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nEpic has paid Apple $6,000,000 as ordered by the court. pic.twitter.com/trulCfjE9S\n— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) September 13, 2021\n \n\r\n\r\nThough Apple r…",

The rollout follows the availability of T-Mobile devices in Best Buy retail stores and the Best Buy website earlier this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrior to becoming available in Walmart and Best Buy, T-Mobile iPhones were only available from Apple or direct from T-Mobile's website and stores, which prevented customers from taking advantage of deals offered by brick and mortar retailers.\n\"In many parts of the country, limited competition when it comes to wireless service leaves some people with few options for plans or access to the benefits of 5G,\" said Jon Freier, Executive Vice President, T-Mobile Consumer Group. \"5G for All means T-Mobile is bringing real choice and competition in wireless to many Americans. And even though online shopping continues to grow, we know that retail stores remain one of the primary places where wireless customers pick up devices and service. We're working to expand our retail footprint across the country to meet more people in more places every day.\"\nMetro by T-Mobile smartphone displays will be available in Walmart retail locations on Monday, October 18.

Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Spain, and Andorra will be the first to get access from October 26. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext year, another wave of territories will be added to that list: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Slovenia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional territory launches are also planned for next year, but there are currently no plans to launch HBO Max in France, Italy, Germany, and the U.K. This is said to be partly due to WarnerMedia having deals in place with other partners in these countries, where HBO programming is available on services such as Sky Atlantic and Now TV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHBO Max was officially launched in the U.S. in May 2020, and has since expanded to 39 territories in Latin America and the Caribbean. Like those regions, the above European countries will gain access to content from HBO, Warner Bros., DC, and Cartoon Network.\r\n\r\n\"This is a historic moment as HBO Max lands in Europe,\" said Johannes Larcher, Head of HBO Max International. \"WarnerMedia movies and series like Harry Potter, Game of Thrones and The Big Bang Theory are passionately consumed by fans all across Europe, and HBO Max has been created to provide them with the most intuitive and convenient viewing experience to watch these and a diverse range of other amazing titles.\"\nHBO has yet to say what the cost of the streaming service will be in Europe, but it will make that announcement in a virtual launch scheduled for October.\nTag: HBO Max\nThis article, \"HBO Max Coming to Six European Countries in October\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The company's first use of a hashflag was for its September 2020 event, when it announced the iPad Air and Apple Watch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwitter allows brands to add the custom emojis next to hashtags as a marketing strategy. According to Agency Creative, each one can cost upwards of one million dollars, and they are commonly used for large events like the Super Bowl or holidays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple's event is set to take place on Tuesday, September 14, where it is expected to announce the new iPhone 13 lineup alongside the Apple Watch Series 7.\nTag: September 2021 Apple Event\nThis article, \"Twitter Hashflag for September 14 Apple Event Goes Live\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

As Variety points out, the bundle now provides a 36 percent discount compared to separate subscriptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hulu + Live TV plans are also not changing in price at this time and continue to start at $64.99 per month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHulu has never before raised the price of its ad-supported tier, and in 2019, dropped the cost from $7.99 per month to $5.99 per month.

Ahead of the iPhone 13 launch, Anker today is introducing a refresh for its Anker Nano, which arrives under the name of Anker Nano Pro and comes in four color options: black, white, blue, and purple.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Anker Nano Pro has a single USB-C port and essentially the same baseline specs as the Anker Nano, but some of the internals have been tweaked to optimize performance and Anker's ActiveShield safety system features advanced temperature monitoring and power output control to help protect your device while it's fast charging.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe color options for the Anker Nano Pro are part of what Anker says is a \"new direction\" for the company that will see it expanding beyond the basic black and white options it's used on most of its products over the years. Other recent colorful product additions for Anker include the lavender grey and mint green versions of the original Anker Nano, several color options for its PowerLine cables, and even the MagSafe-compatible PowerCore Magnetic 5K.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor those looking for a bit more versatility in Anker's lineup of diminutive power adapters, the company is also working on a Nano Pro Dual that will feature 40 watts of charging power and two ports. More information and a launch date for that model will be coming at a later date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe single-port Anker Nano Pro is available now from Amazon and is priced at $19.99.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Anker and Amazon.

          "description": "Apple has referenced four unreleased iPhones in an updated FCC filing for its MagSafe charger, while at the same time referencing the currently released iPhone 12 lineup as \"legacy\" iPhones. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new filing doesn't reveal any details about a possible update to the ‌MagSafe‌ charger; instead, the filing only includes updated testing based on new equipment. In the equipment section of the filing, Apple lists four \"New Phone\" items while also listing A2176, A2172, A2341, and A2342, which correspond to the iPhone 12 mini, ‌iPhone 12‌, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max, respectively, as \"legacy\" devices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEarlier in the summer, Apple registered four new iPhone models in the EEC database, providing us with model IDs for the upcoming iPhones. However, today's new filing doesn't include any model numbers for the \"New Phone\" items, making it difficult to tie a connection between the filing and the EEC entry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmongst the features expected for the iPhone 13, Apple is expected to be improving the strength of the MagSafe magnets on the back of the new iPhones. While the filing doesn't confirm that, Apple may have needed to retest the charger as per FCC regulation on the new iPhones, given their stronger ‌MagSafe‌ system than the 2020 lineup. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple is widely expected to be holding an all-digital event next week on Tuesday, September 14, where it will announce the ‌iPhone 13‌ as well as the Apple Watch Series 7. Apple may confirm the event as early as Tuesday. \nRelated Roundup: iPhone 13\nTag: iPhone 13\nRelated Forum: iPhone\nThis article, \"Apple Labels iPhone 12 As 'Legacy' Device, Lists Four Unreleased iPhones in New MagSafe Charger FCC Filing\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Route 14 is represented by the Phoenix office of law firm Greenberg Traurig, hiding the true ownership of the company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRoute 14 has now exercised an option to purchase the property, which consists of 34 separate parcels, for $125 million in cash. The purchase agreement is dated June 25, 2021, with a deed and assumption of an existing development agreement with the City of Surprise both dated July 30 and seen by MacRumors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have still not been able to concretely tie Apple to Route 14, but it's clear that whoever is behind the firm has deep pockets and a long-term interest in the testing facility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRumors about Apple's work on both autonomous driving systems and actual electric vehicles have ebbed and flowed over the last several years.

The Google-owned service says it attributes this milestone to several factors, but mainly due to how subscribers can get \"uninterrupted access to the largest and most diverse catalogue of music, artists and culture\" through its subscriptions.\r\n\r\nWe've got killer products in YouTube Music and YouTube Premium that deliver truly unique value to artists and creators and the best experience for music fans and video lovers. We're in our own lane -- there's no other place where fans can get uninterrupted access to the largest and most diverse catalogue of music, artists and culture. We're making it easy for music fans to go deep and find their thing -- whether that's on YouTube or the YouTube Music app. \nYouTube Music comes as part of a YouTube Premium subscription but can also be purchased standalone. With YouTube Premium, customers can download videos for offline viewing, play videos in the background playback, no ads, and more. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYouTube Music is one of many competitors to Apple Music, and it's hard to name a winner purely based on subscriber count. Apple doesn't provide specific subscriber figures, but the latest estimate was 60 million subscribers in 2019. Three years on, the number is likely higher. Additionally, Apple One, which bundles ‌Apple Music‌ with other Apple's services, makes it harder to determine how many ‌Apple Music‌ subscribers are out there. \nTags: YouTube, YouTube Music\nThis article, \"YouTube Premium and Music Surpass 50 Million Subscribers\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Apple may be exploring the possibility of using an open-source alternative to the Arm architecture, which it's been using in its products for decades.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to a newly posted job alert, spotted by Tom's Hardware, Apple is looking for an engineer that specializes in RISC-V, an open-source architecture instruction set that allows device makers to build their own chips without having to pay a license or royalty. Apple currently uses the Arm architecture in its products, and it pays the company a royalty fee to use its instruction set. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple's job posting description states that the engineer will implement \"innovative RISC-V solutions and state of the art routines\" to Apple's products. Specifically, Apple hopes prospective engineers will be able to work with the RISC-V instruction set, as well as have an understanding of Arm. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTom's Hardware theorizes that if Apple were to adopt the open-source instruction set of RISC-V, it may save the company money because it wouldn't need to pay Arm a license fee for its instruction set.\r\n\r\nEvery Arm core requires Apple to pay a licensing fee to Arm, and since the number of cores for things like SSD controllers and smartwatches will only increase, so will Apple's payments to Arm. As such, replacing at least some Arm cores with RISC-V cores could save Apple millions of dollars in royalty payments every year...\nThe job listing is a confirmation that Apple is exploring the use of RISC-V, but whether the company decides to implement the open-source technology remains to be seen. Apple's reliance on Arm has increased in the past year as Apple is in the process of switching its Mac lineup to Arm-based processors rather than Intel.\nTag: Arm\nThis article, \"Apple Possibly Exploring Open-Source Alternative to Arm Architecture\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Its privacy team are also working on other potential changes including the ability to remove followers (as opposed to blocking them), hide liked tweets, and remove oneself from a public conversation. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwitter has no timeline for some of the changes, while some features, like the archive option, are still in the \"concept phase,\" but Twitter plans to let people remove followers starting this month, and to let users remove themselves from conversations by the end of the year.\nTags: Twitter, bloomberg.com\nThis article, \"Twitter's Privacy Feature Plans Include Option to Hide Your Old Tweets\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

They work by creating a Wi-Fi hotspot that a hacker can connect to, and using a simple web app they can record keystrokes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cables also include geofencing features that allow users to trigger or block the device's payloads based on its location, preventing the leakage of payloads or keystrokes from other devices being collected. Other features include the ability to change keyboard mappings and the ability to forge the identity of USB devices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cables contain a small implanted chip and are physically the same size as authentic cables, making it extremely difficult to identify a malicious cable. The implant itself apparently takes up around half of the length of a USB-C connector's plastic shell, allowing the cable to continue to operate as normal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn x-ray view of the implanted chip inside the USB-C end of an OMG Cable.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cables, made as part of a series of penetration testing tools by the security researcher known as \"MG,\" have now entered mass production to be sold by the cybersecurity vendor Hak5.

For example, if a user uploads a file to Dropbox or Google Drive, the app may suggest that the user shares the link. If a user downloads a music video, they may get presented with a Smart Action to extract the audio from the video.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe number of Smart Actions is rather extensive and is built directly into the app without launching external apps or services to perform them.

Some observers are speculating that each Super Follow in-app purchase will have to be set up manually by Twitter on the ‌App Store‌, making the system even more unconventional.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ‌App Store‌ does not allow for multiple instances of the same subscription, leading other platforms such as YouTube and Twitch to get around this by effectively allowing users to buy a sub-token that can be directed toward a specific creator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis means that there will be thousands of Twitter in-app purchases, dwarfing Twitter's own Twitter Blue subscription and Ticketed Spaces, Twitter's ‌App Store‌ page will only show 10 in-app purchases since it would be impractical to show the entire list.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple only allows developers to create up to 10,000 in-app purchases, so it is not clear if Twitter will limit the users eligible to sell Super Follows at 10,000 minus Ticketed Spaces and Twitter Blue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwitter announced Super Follows earlier this year, allowing creators with at least 10,000 Followers to charge up to $9.99 per month as a subscription for access to exclusive tweets.

          "description": "Apple is rumored to be in Asia visiting Toyota as it prepares to lay the supplier groundwork to mass produce a branded car by 2024, according to a new report by DigiTimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple representatives were said to have met with South Korea's SK Group and LG Electronics last month to discuss Apple Car development, and now Japan's Toyota is being touted as its next potential destination. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple has been working on a car-related project since at least 2014, and at one stage it looked as if the company was scaling back to focus on autonomous vehicle software. However, following several changes in management and hiring, Apple is now believed to be focused on building a car for consumers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut to do that, the company needs to tap into a whole new supply chain. Apple is expected to rely on a manufacturing partner to build the vehicles, and though it wants to make EV batteries in the United States, it may be seeking partnerships with established vehicle makers like Toyota to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReuters has previously reported that Apple is developing a new battery design that has the potential to \"radically\" reduce the cost of batteries and increase the vehicle's range.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne person who spoke to Reuters described Apple's \"monocle\" battery technology as \"next level\" and said that it's similar to \"the first time you saw the iPhone.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReuters' reporting claimed that Apple is aiming to begin production on an Apple-branded self-driving vehicle starting in 2024, so DigiTimes' focus on that date isn't necessarily a shot in the dark. However, delays caused by the ongoing global health crisis or current chip shortage could always push production to 2025 or beyond.\nRelated Roundup: Apple Car\nTags: digitimes.com, Toyota\nRelated Forum: Apple, Inc and Tech Industry\nThis article, \"Apple Reportedly in Talks With Toyota About Apple Car Production Starting 2024\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Instead, the smart device itself extends the network by talking to other Thread-enabled devices, thereby boosting the signal between them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple's HomePod mini and the latest Apple TV 4K act as Thread border routers, and by adding Thread-supported devices around the home, users can typically expect improved connectivity compared to Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, a wider control range, and more remote scheduling options.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn related news, version 5.3 of the Eve app adds support for its upcoming HomeKit-enabled MothionBlinds, which are expected to launch sometime this year. \nTags: HomeKit, Eve, Thread\nThis article, \"Eve Adds Thread Support to HomeKit-Enabled Thermo Smart Radiator Valve\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The Lexus RX 450h was stopped in traffic and was hit by a Hyundai. The accident was described as minor with no injuries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second accident [PDF] occurred on August 23 in Cupertino, California, right near the Apple Park campus. The vehicle with Apple's self-driving equipment was in manual mode and it was stopped in traffic when it was rear ended by a Subaru Outback.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth of these incidents were not the fault of the self-driving vehicle or the person operating the vehicle, and are largely not notable. What is interesting, though, is that Apple vehicles were involved in two collisions in the same month after no accidents since September 2019.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEarlier this year, the California DMV's disengagement and mileage reports suggested that Apple's Lexus SUVs with self-driving software traversed more than 18,000 miles in 2020, a steep increase compared to prior years. It's possible that Apple has ramped up its testing in 2021, leading to a higher number of incidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple has been testing its self-driving software since early 2017, using the aforementioned Lexus RX 450h vehicles outfitted with sensors and cameras.

Our goal is to better protect the individual on the receiving end of Tweets by reducing the prevalence and visibility of harmful remarks.\nTwitter is testing Safety Mode with a small group of people at the current time and will expand the testing group as feedback is received.

Chromebooks are laptops, tablets, and detachable devices that run Google's Chrome OS operating system, and they are available from brands such as Google, Samsung, Lenovo, Dell, HP, Acer, and ASUS in several markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe report claims that Google was particularly inspired by Apple's success in developing its own chips for not only iPhones, but also Macs following the introduction of the Apple-designed M1 chip last year. The first Macs with Apple silicon chips were released in November 2020 and Apple previously said the transition away from Intel-based processors for its Mac lineup would take about two years to be completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe latest Mac to transition to Apple silicon is the base model iMac, which was updated with the M1 chip, a colorful new design, and a larger 24-inch display in April. Apple is also rumored to be planning redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with a faster version of the M1 chip for release later this year, with multiple reports having stated the notebooks are likely to be released in October or November.\nTag: Google\nThis article, \"Google Reportedly Developing Own Arm-Based Processors for Chromebooks After Being Inspired by Apple Silicon\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Twitter's latest beta update introduces support for providing content creators with Bitcoin tips using the \"Tip Jar\" feature that Twitter introduced earlier this year. Bitcoin isn't yet available to select as a tip option for beta users, but code in the beta suggests that Twitter is in the process of rolling it out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Tip Jar was first introduced, Twitter allowed users to add Bandcamp, Cash App, Patreon, PayPal and Venmo links to their Twitter profile, but soon, there will be a Bitcoin option. The addition of a Bitcoin tipping option comes after Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey told investors in July that Bitcoin was important to the company and would be coming to the Tip Jar in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDetails in the latest Twitter beta indicate that users will be directed through a Bitcoin tutorial that includes details on the Bitcoin Lightning Network and custodial and non-custodial Bitcoin wallets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwitter gives Strike, Blue Wallet and Wallet of Satoshi as examples of custodial wallets and Muun, Breez, Phoenix and Zap as examples of non-custodial wallets. Twitter also informs users that a Strike account is required. \"We use Strike to generate Bitcoin Lightning invoices so you'll need to connect your account to accept Bitcoin tips\" reads the text.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwitter also appears to be working on \"Cheer,\" \"Haha,\" \"Hmm,\" \"Like,\" and \"Sad\" reactions to tweets that users will be able to activate using a press and hold gesture on the current like button.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBitcoin support for tips is limited to the Twitter beta at this time and is not yet available for all beta users, so it is not yet clear when the Bitcoin feature will see an official release. There's also no word just yet on when the new reactions will launch.\nTag: Twitter\nThis article, \"Twitter for iOS Beta Lays Groundwork for Bitcoin Tips\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "China is implementing a new online gaming restriction that will affect children and teenagers who are under 18 years old, reports CNBC. Kids will only be able to play online games for an hour a day (8:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m.) on weekends and legal holidays. Weekday gaming is prohibited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCompanies that provide online game services to minors will need to comply with these rules and will not be able to offer the games to children outside of those hours. Gaming providers will also be required to have users register with their real names and users will need to be logged in to play. Gaming companies are responsible for ensuring minors are not accessing games outside of the permitted time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new rules are meant to safeguard children's physical and mental health, and the National Press and Public Administration said that the guidelines address \"the problem of minors' excessive use\" of online gaming. China previously had a restriction that limited gameplay to 1.5 hours per day, but gaming was allowed on most days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTencent, a major gaming provider in China, said that only a small amount of its gaming revenue comes from younger players. The company plans to implement the new requirements, and earlier today, expressed support for the rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's not clear how these new rules will affect games that operate using the App Store. Apple Arcade is not a factor as it is not offered in China, but there are ‌App Store‌ games that require an online connection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChina in 2016 began requiring mobile gaming developers to officially license their games with the government, and in 2020, pressured Apple to remove ‌App Store‌ games from developers that did not comply. Apple has since pulled tens of thousands of games from the ‌App Store‌ in China.\nThis article, \"Kids and Teens in China Banned From Playing Online Video Games for More Than 3 Hours Per Week\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

By default, tapping the status bar will bring you to the top of your timeline. If this happens by accident and bugs you, you can now turn this feature off.\r\n\r\n- Enable/Disable Drag & Drop Tweets. If you always accidentally invoke the drag and drop feature and wish there was a way to turn that off, now you can!\r\n\r\n- Enable/Disable Swipe to Switch Themes. Swiping up or down with two fingers normally switches to the next or previous theme. If this happens by accident far too often you can now turn this feature off.\r\n\r\n- Enable the ability to Customize All Tabs. For years many of you have asked for the ability to customize all the tab buttons in Tweetbot. Well, finally you can now turn this option on and set your tab menubar exactly how you wish.\r\n\r\n- Before, the short right swipe on a tweet gesture was configurable between liking or retweeting. Now you can also customize this gesture to open link to tweet, copy link to tweet, copy tweet text, add to reading list, or be disabled completely.\nThe latest version of Tweetbot also features additional iPad keyboard shortcuts, a new custom app icon, a new \"Harvest\" light theme, and more.\nTag: Tweetbot\nThis article, \"Tweetbot Updated With New 'Behaviors' Menu on iPhone and iPad\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Speaking to the Australian Financial Review, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said that the recommendations would be carefully considered:\nUltimately, if we do nothing to reform the current framework, it will be Silicon Valley alone that determines the future of our payments system, a critical piece of our economic infrastructure.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder current Australian law, the likes of ‌Apple Pay‌ are not classified as payment systems, putting them outside payment regulations. Classifying ‌Apple Pay‌ as a payment system would clarify the regulatory status of digital wallets in Australia and allow the government to explicitly designate big tech companies as payment providers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther recommendations, contingent on classifying ‌Apple Pay‌ as a payment system, look to establish a strategy for the country's wider payments ecosystem with a single, integrated licensing framework.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAustralian banks such as the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia have previously raised concerns around the growth of digital wallets with \"competition issues\" and purported safety implications. Earlier this year, an Australian Parliamentary Committee considered forcing Apple to open up the iPhone's NFC chip to support third-party payment systems in an effort to promote competition.\nTags: Australia, Apple Pay\nThis article, \"Australia Continues to Scrutinize Apple Pay Amid Push for Regulation\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Apple describes the series as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Problem With Jon Stewart\" is a multiple-season, single-issue series, taking a deep dive on the issues affecting us most.

Together, they will discuss a more productive path towards action.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Problem With Jon Stewart has been anticipated for almost a year, with Stewart having signed a multi-year partnership with Apple TV+. In July, Apple shared a short teaser for the show on Twitter that poked fun at the billionaire space race. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe show is also set to be accompanied by a podcast series that will be available via Apple Podcasts and RSS, the company has today announced. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe companion series podcast will extend the conversation from each episode, featuring staff members from across the show who will bring us interviews with activists in the space, the facts on the issue, and yes, lots of jokes.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA new episode of The Problem with Jon Stewart will follow on ‌Apple TV+‌ every other week from September 30.

Gurman says that Apple plans to make the larger screen real-estate worthwhile by bundling it with new Apple Watch faces that utilize the larger displays.  \r\n\r\nThis year's watches will come in 41-millimeter and 45-millimeter sizes, up from 40 and 44 millimeters. I'm told that Apple will bundle multiple new watch faces to take advantage of the bigger screen, including an updated Infograph Modular face. This will be the second time in the Apple Watch's history that the company has increased the display size, following the Apple Watch Series 4 in 2017. \nThe new Apple Watch faces will be exclusive to the Series 7 and will likely not be made available through a software update for older models. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides cosmetic changes, the Apple Watch Series 7 is expected to include improved performance and battery life.

Sumbul Desai, Apple's vice president of health efforts, and Kristina Raspe, vice president in charge of real estate, are also hosting talks to encourage employees to get the shots.\nThe webpage Apple has created explains the delta variant and how getting vaccinated can help prevent its spread. Apple is also offering vouchers for employees to get vaccinated through Walgreens, and it is providing on-site vaccinations in the San Francisco Bay Area and Austin, Texas. Apple gives employees paid time off for vaccine appointments and paid sick leave for those who experience side effects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple is not mandating that its employees get vaccinated, which is a departure from other tech companies in the area. Both Google and Facebook are requiring employees to be vaccinated, but according to Bloomberg, Apple has not done so for the sake of employee privacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEarlier this month, Apple implemented more frequent testing for corporate and retail employees, asking them to take COVID-19 tests up to three times per week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple initially planned to have employees return to work for three days a week in September, but with cases continuing to ramp up, corporate employees will be able to work from home until at least January 2022.\nThis article, \"Apple Expands Efforts to Vaccinate Employees, But Doesn't Mandate Vaccines\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

From the video description:\nCalling this perfectly-symmetrical, technological marvel, a \"headphone jack\" may feel like an understatement...but technically, that's what it's called, so... fair enough. Behold! The Headphone Jack, on the Google Pixel 5a with 5G.\nSince Jony Ive is no longer Apple's design chief and does not make Apple's product videos, it's not clear why Google has opted to make a video imitating him two years after he left the company. A video promoting the headphone jack is also an unusual choice as fervor over the component has died down now that many high-end smartphones have eliminated it, including Google's own flagship Pixel models. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe $449 Pixel 5a goes on sale today. In addition to a headphone jack, it features a 6.3-inch display with hole punch camera cutout, IP67 water resistance, 5G connectivity, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G chip.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGoogle's Pixel 5a competes with the $699 iPhone 12 mini and the $399 iPhone SE at the current time, but Apple plans to release an upgraded 5G version of the iPhone SE for 2022.\nTags: Google, Google Pixel\nThis article, \"Google Channels Jony Ive in Ad Promoting Pixel 5a Headphone Jack\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Around three weeks before the launch of the iPhone 12 lineup last year, images of packaging stickers showing the correct naming for those devices were also shared by DuanRui.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile most reliable sources have persistently referred to the 2021 ‌iPhone‌ models as the \"‌iPhone 13‌\" lineup, there has been a large amount of speculation from some observers on social media and a number of individuals who claim to be leakers with no track record that the upcoming iPhones would in fact be \"‌iPhone‌ 12S\" models.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA survey from earlier this year suggested that most consumers do not want the devices to be called the \"‌iPhone 13‌.\" 38 percent of survey respondents said that Apple should call its next smartphone series simply \"‌‌iPhone‌‌ (2021),\" 26 percent thought that the \"‌‌iPhone 13‌‌\" was the best name, and only 13 percent said that they would like to see the devices called the \"‌‌iPhone‌‌ 12S.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ‌iPhone 13‌ lineup is expected to be unveiled next month with a number of new features, including a 120Hz display, larger batteries, new camera features, an \"A15\" chip, up to 1TB of storage, and more.\nRelated Roundup: iPhone 13\nTag: DuanRui\nRelated Forum: iPhone\nThis article, \"'iPhone 13' Name Emerges on Alleged Packaging Stickers\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives has suggested the iPhone will launch in the third week of September, which would be the week of September 13 to 17. Based on past launch events, September 7, September 14, and September 21 are all likely event dates where we could see the new ‌iPhone‌ models unveiled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new ‌iPhone 13‌ models will focus heavily on camera capabilities, including ProRes and portrait mode for videos. The new handsets will also include a smaller notch, larger batteries, and improved performance. Apple's third-generation ‌AirPods‌ are expected to have a form factor similar to the AirPods Pro, featuring a new case, a shorter stem, and perhaps replaceable ear tips.\nRelated Roundups: AirPods, iPhone 13\nBuyer's Guide: AirPods (Don't Buy)\nRelated Forums: AirPods, iPhone\nThis article, \"iPhone 13 to Launch on September 17, AirPods 3 on September 30, Claims Report\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Spotify said creators can mark episodes as subscriber-only and publish them to Spotify and other platforms through its podcast creation platform Anchor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpotify also announced that it plans to expand the Podcast Subscriptions program internationally starting September 15 of this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpotify said its model is built to maximize revenue for creators, who will receive 100% of subscription revenue minus payment processing fees until 2023, when the company plans to implement a 5% fee on subscription revenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo changes are being made to the program to benefit creators: additional pricing tiers for subscription fees and the option to download a list of email addresses for subscribers so creators can further engage with their audiences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple rolled out its own Podcasts Subscriptions feature worldwide in June, with the company receiving 30% of a subscriber's revenue in the first year and 15% if they remain subscribed for longer than one year. Creators are also required to enroll in the Apple Podcasters Program for $19.99 per year in order to offer subscriptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBenefits of Apple Podcasts Subscriptions for creators include the ability to offer subscriptions for individual shows or for groups of shows through a \"channels\" feature, the choice to offer fully paid subscriptions or freemium subscriptions with a mix of free and paid episodes, and availability in over 170 countries and regions today. Apple Podcasts Subscriptions also has options for soliciting subscriber email addresses.\nTags: Spotify, Apple Podcasts Subscriptions\nThis article, \"Spotify Competes With Apple by Expanding Podcast Subscriptions Program\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The score is based on your exercise history, sleep, and heart rate, and is used to recommend what exercise routine you should undertake each day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nFitbit Charge 5\n179 USDhttps://t.co/6bhJFPBI6x\n— Snoopy (@_snoopytech_) August 22, 2021\n \n\r\n\r\nEvery device purchased comes with a six-month trial of Fitbit Premium, which is clearly competing with Apple Watch and its Apple Fitness+ integration, with guided workouts and programs on offer on top of sleep tools and other health insights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fitbit Charge will be available in at least three colors, and there's no word on the specific release date for the fitness tracker-cum-smartwatch, but Google is likely to place it strategically around the launch of the Apple Watch Series 7 that's expected to be announced in the next month or so.\nTag: Fitbit\nThis article, \"Fitbit Charge 5 Tracker Design and Features Leaked in New Video\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Microsoft notes some of the ways that Microsoft 365 has grown in prominence over the last year, including that it has added 24 different apps to its suite of tools. \r\n\r\nSince its launch a decade ago, Office 365 has grown to over 300 million commercial paid seats. Along the way, we have continuously re-invested to meet the changing needs of our customers. Four years ago, we introduced Microsoft 365 to bring together the best of Office, Windows, and Enterprise Mobility and Security (EMS). That same year we added Microsoft Teams as the only integrated solution where you can meet, chat, call, collaborate, and automate business processes—right in the flow of work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn fact, since introducing Microsoft 365 we have added 24 apps to the suites—Microsoft Teams, Power Apps, Power BI, Power Automate, Stream, Planner, Visio, OneDrive, Yammer, and Whiteboard—and have released over 1,400 new features and capabilities in three key areas.\nThe pricing increases are small, consisting of only $2-$4 hikes, and are as followed:\r\n\r\nMicrosoft 365 Business Basic (from $5 to $6 per user), Microsoft 365 Business Premium (from $20 to $22), Office 365 E1 (from $8 to $10), Office 365 E3 (from $20 to $23), Office 365 E5 (from $35 to $38), and Microsoft 365 E3 (from $32 to $36).\nAll of the changes will apply globally on March 1, 2022.\nTag: Microsoft 365\nThis article, \"Microsoft Increasing Price of Commercial 'Microsoft 365' Plans Next Year\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Eero will expand compatibility with other products in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNanoleaf is one of the first companies bringing Thread Border Routers to the HomeKit network, making Thread technology available to other Thread-based smart home devices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThread technology is designed to improve the smart home networking and usage experience. Thread is a networking protocol designed for smart home products, and it offers improved connectivity, reliability, and range compared to the single connection points of Bluetooth and WiFi. Border Router technology connects a Thread network to another network like WiFi and is essential for the Thread system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith Thread Border Router functionality built into the Nanoleaf Shapes Controller, Elements Controller, and Eero routers, there is no need for an extra hub because these devices serve as a bridge to connect the WiFi network and the Thread network together.\nTags: HomeKit, Nanoleaf, Thread\nThis article, \"Nanoleaf Adds Thread Border Router Support to Shapes and Elements in Latest Update\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Images of an aluminum cutout allegedly based on the upcoming sixth-generation iPad mini have surfaced online. The cutout is largely in line with rumors of what we can expect in the ‌iPad mini‌ 6, including a larger display in lieu of a Home button, a thinner body, and flat edges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe images originated from the website techordo.com in cooperation with a leaker named xleaks7, whose track record for accurate leaks isn't very well established. The cutout showcases a design much in line with renders of the upcoming ‌iPad mini‌ shared by Apple leaker Jon Prosser earlier in June.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne interesting new change the images depict is the relocation of the volume buttons. The volume buttons on iPads have always been on the right side, however, the images show the buttons relocated to the top, on the opposite side of the power button. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new ‌iPad mini‌ will take inspiration from the updated iPad Air and iPad Pro by ditching the Home Button in favor of an all-screen design. Apple is unlikely to provide users with Face ID embedded into the bezel and is expected instead to integrate Touch ID into the power button, similar to the ‌iPad Air‌. It's also expected to feature a faster processor and possibly USB-C. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReliable Bloomberg journalist Mark Gurman has reported that the new iPad mini is on track to be released this fall, alongside new iPhones, Apple Watches, AirPods, and MacBook Pros. \nRelated Roundup: iPad mini 5\nTag: DuanRui\nBuyer's Guide: iPad Mini (Don't Buy)\nRelated Forum: iPad\nThis article, \"Aluminum Cutout Allegedly Based on iPad Mini 6 Showcases Thinner Bezels, Larger Camera, Touch ID in Power Button\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Google today announced the launch of the low-cost 5G Pixel 5a, a follow up to the Pixel 4a that debuted last year. At its $449 price point, the Pixel 5a most closely competes with the $399 iPhone SE, which is $50 cheaper, though it has a similar feature set to Apple's $699 iPhone 12 mini thanks to the inclusion of 5G.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple is rumored to be working on a new version of the ‌iPhone SE‌ that will also include 5G, with the device set to launch in 2022. The updated ‌iPhone SE‌ will be positioned as Apple's cheapest 5G iPhone, and based on the $449 price point of the Pixel 5a, it could be priced similarly to keep it competitive with lower-cost Android devices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to 5G mmWave and sub-6GHz connectivity, the Pixel 5a brings a bigger 6.3-inch hole punch display that offers more available screen space than the prior Pixel 4a, so it may still have an edge over Apple's upcoming 2022 ‌iPhone SE‌. The new ‌iPhone SE‌ is rumored to feature a design that's \"roughly the same\" as the current ‌iPhone SE‌, which is modeled after the iPhone 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Pixel 5a features include IP67 water resistance, a dual camera setup with wide and ultra wide lenses, a 4,620mAh battery, 6GB RAM, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G chip.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGoogle is selling the Pixel 5a with an 18W adapter that supports fast charging, but Google is taking a page from Apple's playbook. The Pixel 5a will be the last Pixel phone that will include a charger, according to The Verge. Google says that because most people already have a charging brick, its future phones, including the upcoming Pixel 6, will not ship with one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple stopped providing a 5W charger with ‌iPhone‌ models in 2020 and in most countries, iPhones no longer come with a charger.\nTags: Google, Google Pixel\nThis article, \"Google Announces Low-Cost 5G Pixel 5a Smartphone, Plans to Nix Chargers in Box Going Forward\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

[…]\nIn terms of infections, fully vaccinated people were about 11\ntimes less likely to get an infection in the pre-delta period,\ncompared with the unvaccinated (with a 95 percent confidence\ninterval of 7.8 to 15.8). That ratio dropped to 4.6 less likely in\nthe post-delta period (with a 95 percent confidence interval of\n2.5 to 8.5).\nFor hospitalizations prior to delta, fully vaccinated people were\n13 times less likely to wind up in the hospital than the\nunvaccinated (confidence interval of 11.3 to 15.6). After delta,\nthat ratio dropped slightly to 10 times less likely (confidence\ninterval of 8.1 to 13.3).

Plastic\nbags account for over 10,000 hours of lost staff time and pose a\ndanger to workers at recycling facilities because they get caught\nin the equipment. Banning plastic bags will make our city cleaner,\nreduce waste and save money.\nI’ve been reading Millions, Billions, Zillions by Brian Kernighan (who is apparently a computer scientist of some renown). It’s a great book ($11 in hardcover from Amazon; BookShop.org link to indie booksellers), and Kernighan’s writing style is as buttery smooth as ever. One of the things he does is encourage back-of-the-envelope math on numbers like the above, when you encounter them. Does it make sense that Philadelphians use 1 billion plastic bags per year?\nPhilly has about 1.6 million residents. 1 billion divided by 1.6 million is 625 plastic bags per person per year, about 12 bags per person per week, or 1.7 bags per person per day. When I consider how often stores double-bag anything vaguely heavy, that seems plausible. (There’s also the fact that Philly gets many tourists, and in normal times there are many non-residents who commute into the city daily for work. Feel free to bump 1.6 million to a higher number, but for ballpark “does this figure make sense” purposes, I think the Census figure is fine.)\n10,000 annual hours of lost staff time is high, but seems plausible too: That’s about 192 hours per week, or about 5 full-time employees.\n ★",

That’s according to a new breakdown of\nstreaming service privacy policies by Common Sense Media,\nwhich doled out terrible grades to pretty much everybody not\nnamed Apple:\nOur privacy evaluations of the top 10 streaming apps indicate\nthat all streaming apps (except Apple TV+) have privacy\npractices that put consumers’ privacy at considerable risk\nincluding selling data, sending third‐party marketing\ncommunications, displaying targeted advertisements, tracking\nusers across other sites and services, and creating advertising\nprofiles for data brokers.\nThis privacy report focuses on streaming services, not hardware platforms, but related to the previous post re: Amazon’s new Fire TV Omni Series, it’s also the case that Apple TV is the only platform that makes privacy a priority and doesn’t put ads on your screen.\n ★",

After seven years,\nApple Pay’s adoption and usage isn’t much larger than it was 2015\n(5.1%), a year after its launch, and is the same as it was in\n2019, the last full year before the pandemic.\nIt doesn’t really make sense to me that adoption isn’t much higher than it was in 2015, and if these survey results are accurate, I find them surprisingly low. I’d have guessed somewhere in the 15–20 percent range. If it’s true adoption is this low, I think one factor could be first impressions — my wife got turned off by Apple Pay in the earlier years because so many retail terminals that supposedly accepted it were so finicky. Using an old-fashioned credit card was more reliable. Also, habits. But I use Apple Pay today whenever I can, and I find it more reliable than tap-and-pay with a physical card.\nNick Heer, writing at Pixel Envy:\nThis survey shows an approximately flat use rate from 2019 through\n2021, down slightly from 2018. Webster writes that the pandemic\nought to have “changed the trajectory of Apple Pay” as\n“contactless and touchless have become the consumer’s checkout\nmantra”. But anyone with a Face ID-equipped iPhone can tell you\nthat wearing a mask requires you to authenticate by using your\npasscode, so it has been far easier for the past eighteen months\nto simply tap a card. That is probably true generally, as well;\nApple Pay may have better privacy and security, but it is no\neasier to use than a card that supports tap to pay, even without\nthe added complication of pandemic precautions.\nApple Pay with Apple Watch works well while wearing a face mask, but using your iPhone sucks.\n ★",

If there are 10,000 users offering them, 10,000 IAPs. If there are 100,000, our heads explode.\nThis is incredible. Ostensibly, Twitter is doing what Apple wants them to do. Right now Super Follows payments are even exclusive to iOS. (Once you pay on iOS, you can see Super Follow content on Twitter’s Android and web clients, too, but the only way to pay is on iOS through IAP.) But Apple’s IAP system is so brittle that Twitter has to make a discrete SKU for each and every Super Follow user, and pay Apple 30 percent of the price for the privilege. (Twitter, per its published terms, takes just 3 percent of the first $50,000 in lifetime earnings, then 20 percent after that.) Also, because Apple’s IAP listings in the App Store rank IAP offerings by popularity, Twitter is being forced to reveal data that they quite likely would prefer to keep to themselves.\n ★",

This is where we are, mentally, when considering App\nStore rules in 2021.\nI have a friend who works at a company with a somewhat popular “reader” app that everyone has heard of, who says that internally, there’s a contingent that suspects Apple is going to require these apps to also offer Apple’s IAP to be allowed to include a link to their website.\nThat’s how much trust Apple has burned.\nThe spirit of Apple’s settlement with the Japan Fair Trade Commission is clear: these “reader” apps are going to be permitted to link users to their websites for signing up and buying media like e-books, movies, and music. Within that spirit, of course they’re going to be allowed to have text explaining this, and of course they’re not going to be required to also offer Apple’s IAP for these same purchases.\nBut very reasonable, smart people are genuinely skeptical that Apple is going to adhere to the spirit of this settlement.\nCall me a fool, but I think Apple is going to follow through and do the right thing by these apps. There are a lot of negative adjectives that I’d apply to Apple regarding the App Store. Greedy, inconsistent, frustrating, shortsighted, capricious, technically illiterate. Did I say greedy? But one thing Apple is not and never has been is devious. Apple does not play tricks. And the JFTC would not take kindly to tricks.\n ★",

          "description": "This is actually big news from Apple:\nApple today announced an update coming to the App Store that\ncloses an investigation by the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC).\nThe update will allow developers of “reader” apps to include an\nin-app link to their website for users to set up or manage an\naccount. While the agreement was made with the JFTC, Apple will\napply this change globally to all reader apps on the store. Reader\napps provide previously purchased content or content subscriptions\nfor digital magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, and video.\nTo ensure a safe and seamless user experience, the App Store’s\nguidelines require developers to sell digital services and\nsubscriptions using Apple’s in-app payment system. Because\ndevelopers of reader apps do not offer in-app digital goods and\nservices for purchase, Apple agreed with the JFTC to let\ndevelopers of these apps share a single link to their website to\nhelp users set up and manage their account. […]\n“Trust on the App Store is everything to us. The focus of the App\nStore is always to create a safe and secure experience for users,\nwhile helping them find and use great apps on the devices they\nlove,” said Phil Schiller, Apple Fellow who oversees the App\nStore. “We have great respect for the Japan Fair Trade Commission\nand appreciate the work we’ve done together, which will help\ndevelopers of reader apps make it easier for users to set up and\nmanage their apps and services, while protecting their privacy and\nmaintaining their trust.”\nProgress. Apple’s anti-steering provisions are the number one thing I have been clamoring to be changed in the App Store rules. I think this should expand beyond just “reader” apps, but one step at a time.\nDo you hear that sound? That’s the sound of a significant amount of antitrust pressure being relieved from Apple.\n ★",

The book\nfeatured charming drawings of a bird named Charlie who realized he\ndidn’t sound like most of the other birds, and who left home to\nfly to New York City, where he played “from his heart” and made a\nnew nest for himself in “Birdland.”\nCharlie Parker made a 14-year-old Charlie Watts dream the\nimpossible dream of visiting New York and playing at a jazz club.\nAnd while he thought at the time that “the only way to get to New\nYork was in a band on a cruise ship,” he would actually get there\nin 1964 with the Rolling Stones. While Keith Richards and Mick\nJagger hung out at the Apollo, where James Brown was doing\nfive — five! — shows a day, Mr. Watts spent his free time\nhaunting the jazz clubs he’d dreamed about as a boy: He saw\nCharles Mingus at Birdland, Gene Krupa at the Metropole, and Sonny\nRollins, Earl Hines and Miles Davis.\nLovely memorial, with some great quotes from his bandmates.\n ★",

Advertorials should be, after all. Players will also get the obligatory Danny Trejo cameo (con el machete, of course), and a Rambo mission series whose premise sounds like it kinda works? Rambo himself doesn’t drop into the game — it’s a Yaran superfan who, despite the near total cutoff of the island (vis-a-vis Cuba), has followed the 1980s action series and become obsessed with the character.\n\n\nThe three crossovers, coming post launch, led off a roadmap video Ubisoft posted on Friday. Players will also get, free from day one, weekly cooperative multiplayer operations — they’re “insurgencies” and “special ops.”\nOf course, this is a Ubisoft joint, so there’s a season pass with premium post-launch stuff, too. As mentioned before, you’ll be going inside the minds of Pagan Min, Vaas, and Joseph Seed to learn more about how those three got so messed up. Expect a lot of surrealism, and a lot of dying, but also a lot of loot?\nFar Cry 6 launches Oct. 7 for Amazon Luna, Google Stadia, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. The game was originally due in February, but was delayed as Ubisoft adjusted its COVID-19 development plans.

To finally destroy the alien threat, developer Epic Games is releasing a new season-ending event that will have players infiltrate The Last Reality and save the world. The event will begin at 4 p.m. EDT on Sunday, Sept. 12. \nThe final event of Fortnite Chapter 2 season 7 will be called Operation: Sky Fire and will be a one-time event that all players can participate in, similar to previous events. Unlike some events, however, there will be no replays available for Operation: Sky Fire. The event will take place in its own separate playlist which will go live 30 minutes before the event is set to begin — which is probably when you’ll want to be online, based on the server queues that have happened in the past. \nThis new event also comes with a few unique warnings from Epic. According to the developer’s post on the Fortnite website, players should make sure that all of their challenges are completed before the event begins, and that all of their Battle Stars have been redeemed — otherwise they’ll automatically be redeemed, starting with the earliest available unlocks. Players will also need to complete all of their Superman quests before the event if they want to unlock all of his cosmetic goodies. \nFortnite Chapter 2 season 8 is set to begin sometime after Operation: Sky Fire, but just how soon after, and what happens next, are things we’ll have to find out after the event.",

But it was Homer, beloved cat of protagonist Frey, that stole the hearts of viewers. The problem came when fans started wondering, “What’s going to happen to Homer while Frey is out kicking ass the entire game?”\nOn Twitter and YouTube, fans seemed excited about Forspoken, but concerned about Homer. “What happens to the cat?!?!” they asked. “I need closure for Homer...” one fan pleaded. “I 100% agree with everyone else, I can’t handle the guilt of letting my cat starve to death in my apartment while I play with dragons,” worried another.\nBut a new tweet from the Forspoken Twitter account has soothed fans.\nThis is a Homer appreciation post.  \nP.S. Promise she's OK. pic.twitter.com/wyFXQ0Ue6p\n— Forspoken (@Forspoken) September 10, 2021\n\n\n\nHomer, the talkative Balinese house cat with big blue eyes, will not be starving to death during your journey as Frey, it seems. While assurances are certainly appreciated for those of us with animal anxiety, it’s still not clear what Homer will be up to. Will she adventure alongside Frey as some of the YouTube comments suggest? Or will Homer get to relax at home with a cat sitter?

The developer revealed the new information, along with a few screenshots, on Tuesday, during Call of Duty: Vanguard’s multiplayer reveal stream.\nLike everything related to Vanguard, Warzone’s new map will be World War II-themed. The map is set in the Pacific, on an island with dense foliage and a few small towns and cities for players to fight in. Based on the early footage, it seems like the map will be a lot more tropical than Verdansk, and should feature more fighting in the jungles than the more urban settings of previous maps. \nThe new Warzone map will also run on the same engine as Call of Duty: Vanguard — which is essentially the same engine as Modern Warfare and the original version of Warzone’s Verdansk. According to Raven Software, this means that the game will easily integrate with Vanguard, including its weapons and gameplay style, which should be present on the new Pacific theater map when it’s released sometime later this fall. \nThe other major Warzone update that Raven Software offered on Tuesday was an update about the game’s new anti-cheat system. Unfortunately, that update didn’t really contain any new or meaningful details. But with Warzone cheating as bad as it’s been recently, it’s nice to hear that Raven is still hard at work on the new system. In a Call of Duty blog post on Tuesday, Raven called the system a “multifaceted new anti-cheat system for PC,” and explained that it’s still testing the system at the moment, but that it should be ready for Warzone’s Pacific map launch. \nImage: Raven Software/Activision\n  \n  \n        \n      Image: Raven Software/Activision\n  \n  \n        \n      Image: Raven Software/Activision\n  \n  \n        \n      Image: Raven Software/Activision",

For this batch, Riot collaborated with EDM artist Zedd to make a line up of musically infused weapon varieties. \nThe skin line will be called Spectrum, and Riot debuted the first look at each of the guns on Tuesday. The bundle includes skins for the Phantom, Guardian, Bulldog and Classic weapons, as well as for the knife melee weapon. Each skin has three variant colors (purple, red, and black) and a few upgrades, which players can unlock with Radianite Points. \nThe skins’ base variety is a sleek white with bright LEDs on the side, which change colors as you move, like the lights in a club. Spectrum skins also have unique animations for kills, a variety of unique firing sounds, and their round-finisher upgrade turns the map into a giant dance party. \nThis latest skin line isn’t the first time that Riot has collaborated with Zedd either. Back in 2016, the artist did the theme song for that year’s League of Legends World Championship — a track that remains a favorite of League fans today. While Riot has made plenty of exciting skins in the past, Spectrum seems to have some of the most complicated cosmetics the developer has ever made for Valorant. They’re definitely the most in-depth since last year’s Elderflame skins.\nThe Spectrum skin line is set to arrive in the Valorant in-game store on Wednesday, a day before the game’s new map, Fracture, will be released. The bundle, which includes all the skins, two gun buddies, a player card, and a spray, will cost a whopping 10,700 Valorant Points. For some perspective there, 11,000 Valorant Points costs $99.99.",

Squall, Rinoa, and the rest of the SeeD gang are part of one of the most underrated Final Fantasies, and it’s nice to see more players having access to that tale. \nThis is followed by Final Fantasy 9 on Nov. 2, which is still fondly remembered thanks to characters like Vivi, Garnet, and Zidane. In December, players get a two-fer with Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2 HD Remaster.

          "description": "Image: Riot Games\n    \n\n  \nAttack and defense are a little different on Fracture\n Valorant’s new map is its most unique so far. Fracture, which was officially announced on Wednesday, reverses attackers and defenders and makes both sides play a little differently than they’re used to. \nFracture is shaped like a giant letter “H.” There are two bombsites on the map with the connecting section of the “H” in-between. While you might expect the middle section to be the attacker’s spawn, it’s actually the other way around. On Fracture, defenders start in the middle, leaving the spawn area to defend the sites on either side. Meanwhile, the attackers can pinch in toward the defenders from either side. To help make transitioning from one area of the map to another a little easier, there are also ziplines that run from one side to the other that run below the map.\nImage: Riot Games\n  \nThis represents a pretty massive change to the regular format for Valorant maps, which generally place defenders in positions that encourage more passive play, allowing attackers to push into them. However, on this map, the spawns mean that defenders are often put in the position to make the first move. \n\n\nFracture also includes more lore than any previous Valorant map. The map features two mirror versions of reality, which is essentially the set up for the game’s larger story — and its explanation for why two versions of the same Agent might face off in a match. While we don’t know much about the world beyond its mirrored concept, there are interactable clues spread out around Fracture that should shed some new light on Valorant’s two realities. \nImage: Riot Games\n  \nFracture is set to come to Valorant as part of the patch 3.05 update, which players should expect to arrive next week as part of the game’s new Act update. Valorant Episode 3 Act 2 is scheduled to drop around Sept. 9. \nImage: Riot Games",

Players have a collection of Mercenary characters that they can pit against competing teams in both PvP and PvE modes. Blizzard will release Mercenaries on Oct. 12. \nPlayers will start with eight Mercenary characters and the main hub, a Village. The Village lets players manage their characters and base, then send their squad off on a procedurally generated Bounty run or a competitive match against another person. At launch, there will be over 50 Mercenaries, including the Lich King, Sylvanas, and Diablo (from the Diablo games, obviously). Completing the Mercenaries prologue also grants players a mouse mount in World of Warcraft.\nThere are three kinds of Mercenaries: Fighter, Caster, and Protector, which exist in a rock-paper-scissors system. Once players figure out their squad of three characters, they head into combat, which is turn-based. Each side picks their team’s actions, and then the round plays out. The format feels similar to Hearthstone’s Battlegrounds mode, with rounds split between decision making and action.\nHearthstone publisher Activision Blizzard faces wide-ranging allegations that it maintains a toxic workplace environment that is particularly hostile to women, pays them less, and subjects them to sexual harassment, and that perpetrators are not meaningfully punished, according to a lawsuit filed by California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing in July. You can read more about the allegations against Activision Blizzard in Polygon’s explainer.

In an interview for Twitch’s The Weekly show, Destiny 2 game director Joe Blackburn confirmed that players won’t see a new powerset in The Witch Queen expansion.

We have one in development, you’re gonna see it eventually, but we really want to make sure we get it right.”\nBlackburn went on to speak about the Light subclass rework, which will use the Stasis system added to the game in Beyond Light. The creative director talked up the new reworks for these Light subclasses, suggesting that longtime players will have a lot more tools and combinations to play with. \nIt’s currently unclear what the fifth subclass type will be in Destiny 2 — or when players will get their hands on it.

They can watch King’s famous speech, which Epic and Time Studios licensed from his family’s estate — a critical piece of history that even the Oscar-nominated 2014 biopic Selma wasn’t able to feature.

The collection bundles Monster Rancher (1997) and Monster Rancher 2 (1999), and will launch Dec. 9 on Nintendo Switch, Windows PC via Steam, and iOS, Koei Tecmo announced Thursday.\nIn the Monster Rancher games, players raise monsters and train them to compete against other creatures in combat and tournaments, just like in Pokémon. The original Monster Rancher launched with a fun gimmick where players could use physical CDs to unlock monsters in the game, with each CD corresponding to a monster. \nMost people don’t use CDs anymore, but the developers found a way to rework the feature into their modern version of the game. In Monster Rancher 1 & 2 DX, you’ll be able to search a database to find each monster’s desired CD and generate a monster from its data. \n\n\nThe re-release will include new content that wasn’t in the original Western release, like additional save slots, Freeze slots, and Monster Hall of Fame slots. The newer version will bring a few other improvements to gameplay, as well. Players will now be able to use a memo feature while raising monsters, view rankings from random battles, and use a high-speed mode to play through the game faster. \nThe Monster Rancher reboots are but a few of the many Pokémon-likes that have been announced or released in recent years. There’s Temtem, a hardcore MMO version of Pokémon released in 2020, and Palword, a game that takes the concept of raising cute monsters and turns it into a brutal survival game, which is due sometime in 2022. Or also, you could just play one of the many actual Pokémon games that are slated to be released in the next few months, like Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl or Pokémon Legends: Arceus.",

The studio revealed a host of details around the major update, including the addition of weapon crafting and a new weapon type: the Glaive.\nThe Glaive is a kind of spear or polearm in Destiny 2, with a long, curved blade on the end. It’s the series second bladed melee weapon, after Bungie added swords in The Taken King, but it’s the first melee weapon that keeps Guardians in first-person. Glaives, like swords,  will have melee combos, but unlike swords, they’re energy weapons and don’t sit in the heavy slot. But players can also launch projectiles with them.\nThe Witch Queen also introduces Destiny 2’s first real weapon crafting system, although Bungie has fiddled with the idea in past seasons like with The Menagerie’s Chalice of Opulence mechanic. Bungie says this new mechanic will let players “craft the perfect roll,” and combine unique mods with advanced stats. It seems like it should allow players to find the weapons they’re looking for more easily.\nThe studio isn’t revealing much about the system just yet, but it’s the only way players can unlock the new Glaive. Guardians will be able to craft weapons from The Witch Queen at launch, with even more weapons coming later in 2022.\nThe Witch Queen expansion takes players to meet Savathun — the titular Witch Queen and sister of Oryx from Destiny’s The Taken King expansion. Players will adventure into her Throneworld to discover how Savathun and her brood of Hive began wielding their own Ghosts and the Light powers that come with them.",

Aloy will join the Genshin Impact cast in the 2.1 update as a free five-star archer, but comes first to those with PlayStation consoles via early access. Aloy and Shogun will be joined by Sangonomiya Kokomi, a five-star who wields the power of Hydro and is a catalyst, and Kujou Sara, a ranged attacker with Electro attacks.  \nAs for fishing, Mihoyo said in a news release that “players can soon go angling for a variety of fishes across the continent of Teyvat,” which can be used to produce fish meat of exchange for rewards.",

          "description": "Image: 343 Industries/Xbox Game Studios\n    \n\n  \nThe announcement was made Friday in a video update by 343 Industries\n Halo Infinite won’t launch with two of the franchise’s most desirable features. Developers at 343 Industries said Friday that campaign co-op and the multiplayer map-editing Forge mode won’t be available when the game arrives. Forge in particular will lag behind “about six months.” The announcement was made on YouTube.\n“Unfortunately as we focused the team for shutdown and really focused on a quality experience for launch we made the really tough decision to delay shipping campaign co-op for launch,” Staten said, “and we also made the tough call to delay shipping Forge past launch as well.”\n343 announced one year ago that Halo Infinite would miss its original 2020 launch window, delaying the game into 2021. It still has no firm release date. On Friday, 343 said that the co-op campaign mode would be released as season 2 of Halo Infinite’s post-launch content, and that Forge mode would be part of season 3.\nStaten said that these modes were delayed in order to ensure the quality of the base game.\n“Our number one priority is making sure that whatever we ship, whenever we ship it, it meets the right quality bar across all platforms,” he said in the video. “And when we looked at these two experiences, campaign co-op and Forge, we made the determination they’re just not ready. And as a studio we don’t want to ship things if they’re not ready.”\nCo-operative play has been at the heart of the Halo franchise since the beginning. Forge mode, which allows players to build their own multiplayer levels and game modes and share them online, was introduced with Halo 3 in 2007.",

Skyrim is about to turn 10, which is a very momentous anniversary indeed, and the new Anniversary Edition will have some nice bonuses for players. \nSkyrim’s Anniversary Edition will be available for players on the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. The Anniversary Edition contains the full game, all enhancements from the Special Edition, and the Dawnguard, Hearthfire, and Dragonborn expansions.\nThe game comes with a free next-gen console upgrade, over 500 Creation Club elements like quests, dungeons, bosses, and weapons.  Also, there’s fishing now, which is great. You could argue that Skyrim didn’t need a fishing pole, but it’s always nice to have a fishing minigame, and the elements from popular mods will likely round the experience out as well.\nIt’s a common joke that Skyrim will never die, especially because Bethesda continues to re-release and port the game. The base game can run on less powerful platforms like the Nintendo Switch, and in 2018, Bethesda debuted a joke announcement for Skyrim: Very Special Edition, which is an actual playable game on the iPhone, iPad, and Amazon Echo ... as long as you can figure out the voice commands.

But it’s not a continuation of developer Sledgehammer Games’ previous WWII game, nor will Vanguard carry over Call of Duty: WWII’s health pack system. Vanguard will instead use the automatic health regeneration system common to modern Call of Duty games.\nDuring a presentation lead by Sledgehammer Games, Call of Duty: Vanguard game director Josh Bridge said that the game’s campaign will feature automatic health regen, for a “more unified experience.\n“[The] campaign will have auto health regen,” Bridge said in a statement to Polygon. “[The] goal is to keep to a more unified experience between modes, and matching health systems was something that the team felt was important. Coupled with that decision, each of the main characters you play as bring unique to them abilities/mechanics in their levels. This further drives an overall sense of gameplay variety across the campaign, but also these abilities help distinguish each character’s identity.”\nCall of Duty: Vanguard will span four theaters of war and four playable characters: Sgt. Arthur Kingsley, of Britain’s 9th Parachute Battalion; Lt.

          "description": "Image: Treyarch/Activision\n    \n\n  \nVanguard Zombies will tie into Black Ops Cold War’s Zombies mode\n Treyarch’s Call of Duty Zombies modes are usually limited to the games the studio develops itself, but that’s not the case this time around. During Thursday’s announcement stream for Call of Duty: Vanguard, Activision revealed that the Sledgehammer-developed game will feature a Zombies mode made by Treyarch.\nTreyarch’s latest Zombie content was for Black Ops Cold War, which it also developed. Unlike previous games, the Zombie content in Black Ops Cold War came as part of free seasonal updates to the game, rather than expansion packs that players had to pay for. On top of the extremely popular round-based maps, Treyarch also introduced a new mode called Outbreak that throws players and zombies together inside a massive open area where players have to complete a series of random objectives. \nTreyarch’s Zombies entries have also continued to tell an ongoing story, which just got a new update with the latest round-based map. It’s unclear if the Zombies mode in Vanguard will continue Treyarch’s Black Ops storyline or be something entirely separate. \nCall of Duty: Vanguard will be released on Nov. 5. Activision and Treyarch hasn’t announced if the Zombies mode will arrive when the game launches or sometime after. \nAt the same time Vanguard is being shown for the first time, Call of Duty publisher Activision Blizzard faces wide-ranging allegations that it maintains a toxic workplace environment that is particularly hostile to women.

On Tuesday, developer CD Projekt Red released a complete set of patch notes detailing fixes for 85 quests and gigs, plus improvements and balance changes throughout the game. The developer said the free update is headed to consoles, PC, and Stadia soon but declined to provide a release date.\nIn addition to the quality of life changes detailed on Monday, the 1.3 patch appears to be a substantial one. CD Projekt is also including a few of what it is calling “free DLCs.” They will take the form of additional cosmetic items for the player character, quest options, phone texts, and animations. Several of those DLCs were teased during a Twitch livestream, and a complete list will be included in the Main Menu under “Additional Content” heading.\nSenior level designer Miles Tost was on hand during today’s Twitch stream to speak to the complexity of the issues that his colleagues are dealing with. He likened this and other patches to “open heart surgery.”\n\n\nCyberpunk 2077 launched in a sorry state in December, with many bugs and quality issues across every platform on which it was released. Though it quickly recouped its development costs, it was a source of embarrassment for the company’s leadership, which chose to accept the blame and apologize to fans and investors. The game was even delisted from the PlayStation Store shortly after launch, only to return in June of this year.

That will likely mean the addition of Pinhead (aka the Hell Priest, aka Xipe Totec), the lead Cenobite of Clive Barker’s sadomasochistic demon gang, as the next Dead by Daylight killer.\nBehaviour Interactive’s teases have quickly been deciphered by the Dead by Daylight community. The studio sneaked the letters R-A-I-S-E into a series of tweets and images over the past week, and the letters H-E-L-L into an audio file recently posted to Discord. A video teaser released Friday also subtly hints at Hellraiser, showing staticky, VHS-style footage of flower blossoms that evokes a scene from the original Hellraiser movie from 1987.\nThat’s the good news. The bad news for Dead by Daylight fans is the impending loss of another license: Netflix’s Stranger Things. Behaviour Interactive announced Monday that characters Nancy Wheeler, Steve Harrington, and the Demogorgon will no longer be available for purchase as DLC as of Nov. 17. Dead by Daylight players who already have those characters will still be permitted to play with them after that date, but the Hawkins National Laboratory Underground Complex map will no longer be playable.\nBehaviour is giving Stranger Things fans a chance to get that expiring content at a discount. before it goes away. Steve, Nancy, and the Demorgorgon (and cosmetic DLC for all three) are currently on sale for 50% off.\nDead by Daylight’s Stranger Things content was added to the game in September 2019. Since then, Behaviour has added licensed killers such as Pyramid Head from Silent Hill and the Nemesis T-Type from Resident Evil, alongside original characters like K-pop killer Ji-Woon Hak and creepy conjoined twins Charlotte and Victor Deshayes.",

On Monday, developer CD Projekt Red teased a trio of changes which should be exciting for dedicated players. It also includes a fix to an early game quest that has been frustrating players for a while now. The in-fiction announcement was made on social media, and includes a fairly obtuse description of what to expect. Here’s the gist of what’s on the way.\nFirst, the minimap while driving appears to show slightly more of the road ahead of you than it did before. That should make navigating — especially at high speeds — a lot easier. \n\n\nSecond, the early game quest that takes place in the Clouds club has been altered slightly. Previously, players were presented with the choice of hiring one of two different sex workers, named Angel (male presenting) and Skye (female presenting). However, their pictures were removed from view prior to giving players the option to choose. With patch 1.3, CD Projekt will now show the image of both sex workers on screen while the dialogue option is available, giving players a better idea of which gender expression they’ll be intimate with over the course of the night.\n\n\nFinally, Cyberpunk 2077’s 1.3 patch also lowers the cost to respec your character’s perks. Previously, players had to visit a ripperdoc and purchase an item called Tabula e-Rasa for 100,000 eurobucks. With the next patch you can simply pay 13,200 eurobucks right from their character menu.\n“For our players, this feature will mean safer experimentation with builds,” CD Projekt Red gameplay designer Katarína said in a blog post. “It is easily accessible and affordable for everyone, so there is no need to hesitate while investing in particular perks.”\nMonday’s announcement went on to say that a full list of changes is on the way.

Of course, the outfit won’t be the only cosmetic for the Amazonian hero. She’ll also be released alongside the Athena’s Battleaxe gathering tool, the DC Trinity loading screen, where she poses with Batman and Superman, the Golden Eagle Wings glider, and the Diana’s Mantle back bling. \nThe new skin will make Diana Prince the latest member of the Justice League to join Fortnite. Many other heroes have found a place on the Fortnite island in the last several years, including several others from DC, like Beast Boy and Raven, as well as Marvel heroes like Black Widow, and the rest of the Avengers. \nFortnite’s Wonder Woman skin will be released on Aug. 19. To celebrate the release of the new outfit, Epic will also host the Wonder Woman Cup tournament and give players a few challenges to complete, all related to the Amazonian warrior.",

You can see her in action in the trailer above.\n\n\nJack-O’ is coming to Guilty Gear Strive on Aug. 27 for players who own the game’s $29.99 season pass. Everyone else can download her starting Aug. 30, for $6.99. She’s one of five characters planned for Guilty Gear Strive’s first season pass. One more DLC fighter is planned for release in 2021, with two more coming in 2022.\nGuilty Gear fans can also look forward to Baiken from Arc System Works’ fighting game series coming to SNK’s Samurai Shodown as part of season pass 3.\n\n\nGuilty Gear Strive is available now on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC.",

          "description": "The Wire creator David Simon wrote about his friend and colleague Michael K. Williams, who died suddenly last week at the age of 54. The Question Michael K. Williams Asked Me Before Every Season of ‘The Wire’:\nAnd from that moment forward, his questions about our drama and its purposes were those of someone sharing the whole of the journey. It became something of a ritual with us: To begin every season that followed, Michael K. Williams would walk into the writers’ office and sit on the couch.\n“So,” he would ask, “what are we going to say this year?”\nHe gave us an astounding gift — an act of faith from a magnificent actor who could have played his hand very differently. Television usually chases its audience — if they love them some Omar, you feed them more Omar. If they can’t stop looking at Stringer, you write more Stringer. Never mind story and theme.\nInstead, Mike bent his beautiful mind to a task that even the best writers and show runners often avoid. He thought about the whole story, the whole of the work.\nPerhaps more than any in that talented cast, I came to trust Mike to speak publicly to our drama and its purposes, to take personal pride in all that we were trying, however improbably, to build. He became increasingly political as the show aged, and in interviews took to addressing societal and political issues, his arguments ranging well beyond Omar’s arc.\n“I started to realize that, oh, this is not about me,” Williams once told an interviewer, looking back. “It had everything to do with … just great tapestry, this great narrative of social issues … things that are wrong in our country.”\n\n\nSee also tributes from Wendell Pierce and other actors & filmmakers who worked with Williams.\nTags: David Simon   Michael K.

Maya Cade writes about why she created this archive.\nThe films collected on Black Film Archive have something significant to say about the Black experience; speak to Black audiences; and/or have a Black star, writer, producer, or director. This criterion for selection is as broad and inclusive as possible, allowing the site to cover the widest range of what a Black film can be.\nThe films listed here should be considered in conversation with each other, as visions of Black being on film across time. They express what only film can: social, anthropological, and aesthetic looks at the changing face of Black expression (or white attitudes about Black expression, which are inescapable given the whiteness of decision-makers in the film industry). \nFilms, by their very nature, require a connection between creator and audience. This relationship provides a common thread that is understood through conventional and lived knowledge to form thought and to consider. Not every filmmaker is speaking directly to Blackness or Black people or has the intention to. Some films listed carry a Black face to get their message across. But presented here, these films offer a full look into the Black experience, inferred or real, on-screen.\n\n\nWhat a great open resource — exactly what the internet is for.

          "description": "Documentaries about mushrooms like Fantastic Fungi are interesting but it turns out that short documentaries about how mushroom documentaries are made are fascinating as well. For this short video, Wired talked to Louie Schwartzberg about how mushroom time lapses are filmed. I don’t know why I assumed they filmed these outside…of course they are done indoors to help control lighting, weather, and other factors (like rogue wildlife). And after decades of working on nature films, Schwartzberg has integrated his process deeply into his life:\nI realized I’ve turned it into a spiritual practice. It actually literally gets me up in the morning because as soon as I’m out of bed, I’m thinking ooh, “I wonder what the flower did last night? Is it still in frame? Is it in focus?”\nI have to imagine what the framing and the composition is going to look like tomorrow, or two days from now, or a week from now. That is a transformational experience because you have to put your mind into the mindset and the intention of the flower or the fungi, thinking where it’s going to grow, how big will it get. And if you’re right, boy, it’s a rush. If you’re wrong, it means you just gotta do it all over again.\n\n\nThis was surprisingly philosophical in parts.\nTags: Fantastic Fungi   video",

          "description": "Because of humans, most of the world’s oyster reefs have disappeared over the last 200 years. Now, some groups around the world are trying to put some of them back. In addition to providing water filtration and habitats for other animals, offshore oyster reefs can help slow long-term erosion by acting as living breakwater structures that partially deflect waves during storm surges.\nIn the last century, 85% of the world’s oyster reefs have vanished. And we’re only recently beginning to understand what that’s cost us: While they don’t look incredibly appealing from the shore, oysters are vital to bays and waterways around the world. A single oyster can filter up to 50 gallons of water every day. And over time, oysters form incredible reef structures that double as habitats for various species of fish, crabs, and other animals. In their absence, our coastlines have suffered.\nNow, several projects from New York to the Gulf of Mexico and Bangladesh are aiming to bring the oysters back. Because not only are oysters vital ecosystems; they can also protect us from the rising oceans by acting as breakwaters, deflecting waves before they hit the shore. It won’t stop the seas from rising — but embracing living shorelines could help protect us from what’s to come.\n\n\n(via the kid should see this)\nTags: food   global warming   oysters   video",

          "description": "As his name suggests, Jamaican street musician Brushy One String plays a one-string guitar and, under that constraint, makes some truly beautiful music. Josh Jones wrote about Brushy for Open Culture:\nWhen Jamaican musician Andrew Chin, better known as Brushy One String first told friends about his vision — “a dream in which he was told to play the one-string guitar” — they responded with mockery — all but one, who “insisted it was fate,” writes Playing for Change, “and that he had to make that dream come true.” So Brushy set out to do just that, playing on street corners and in the market, “in a big broad hat and sunglasses,” he says. The music came to him naturally. He is no ordinary street musician, however, and his one-string guitar is not a gimmick. Brushy is a talented singer-songwriter, with a powerful voice and a musical sensibility that transcends his bare-bones minimalism.\n\n\nIn addition to his NPR Tiny Desk Concert above, this video of Brushy performing Chicken in The Corn on his one-string has been viewed over 50 million times.\nSee also Gasper Nali and His Homemade [One-String] Bass Guitar. Would love to see a duet with these two single stringers!\nTags: Brushy One String   music   video",

Evan Puschak’s Nerdwriter is a particular favorite guiding light and in his latest video, he talks about Agnès Varda’s Cléo from 5 to 7, a film I now want to watch as soon as possible. A synopsis via Wikipedia:\nCléo from 5 to 7 follows a pop singer through two extraordinary hours in which she awaits the results of a recent biopsy. The film is superficially about a woman coming to terms with her mortality, which is a common auteurist trait for Varda. On a deeper level, Cléo from 5 to 7 confronts the traditionally objectified woman by giving Cléo her own vision. She cannot be constructed through the gaze of others, which is often represented through a motif of reflections and Cléo’s ability to strip her body of “to-be-looked-at-ness” attributes (such as clothing or wigs). Stylistically, Cléo from 5 to 7 mixes documentary and fiction, as had La Pointe Courte. The film represents diegetic action said to occur between 5 and 7 p.m., although its run-time is 89 minutes.\n\n\nI’ve added Cléo from 5 to 7 to my HBO Max queue but you can also find it on Kanopy (accessible with a library card) and The Criterion Channel.\nTags: Agnes Varda   Cleo from 5 to 7   Evan Puschak   film school   movies   video",

Gorman read Herman Melville’s masterpiece last year and made these maps & graphics to help him make sense of it.\nI read Moby-Dick in April 2020. For weeks afterward, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I started making maps and diagrams as a way to figure it out.\nMoby-Dick is infamous for its digressions. Throughout the book, the narrator disrupts the plot with contemplations, calculations, and categorizations. He ruminates on the White Whale, and the ocean, and human psychology, and the night sky, and how it all relates back to the mystery of the unknown. His narration feels like a twisting-turning struggle to explain everything.\nReading Moby-Dick actually made me feel like that-like I’d mentally absorbed its spin-cycle style. I developed a case of “Kaleidoscope Brain.” The maps I was making were obsessive and encyclopedic. They were newer and weirder and they digressed beyond straightforward geography.\n\n\nThe book is available as a free download on Gorman’s Patreon — support his efforts if you find them valuable!\nAbove, from top to bottom: the letters of the alphabet in order of their appearance in the book, the constellation Cetus (aka “The Whale”), every color in the book.\nTags: books   design   Herman Melville   infoviz   Moby Dick   Peter Gorman   remix",

          "description": "Oh, I really like this new NYC subway mosaic installed in the corridor between Times Square and Bryant Park designed by Nick Cave.1 It’s based on Cave’s Soundsuits project, full-body suits that “camouflage the shape of the wearer, enveloping and creating a second skin that hides gender, race, and class, thus compelling the audience to watch without judgment”. From a NY Times piece on the mosaic:\nThe Soundsuits have always been an amalgam of cultural references, Cave explained: the concepts of shamans and masquerade, obscuring the race, gender and class of the wearer and forging a new identity. They contain ties to Africa, the Caribbean and Haiti.\n“It’s very important that you can make references, you can connect to something,” Cave said. “In one of the mosaics in the corridor, there’s a sneaker. So that brings it to this urban, right-now time.”\nFrom beneath a pink-and-black cloak of raffia, carefully crafted out of glass shards, pokes a contemporary sneaker in shades of salmon, white and maroon. Cave likes the play that’s happening here: The form is sometimes figurative, sometimes abstract. “Sometimes it’s identifiable and sometimes it’s not,” he said. “But that’s the beauty of it all.”\n\n\n(thx, caroline)\n\nNo, not that Nick Cave.↩\n\nTags: art   Nick Cave   NYC   subway",

But in terms of what these vaccines were specifically developed for — reducing & preventing severe disease and death — they are still very much doing their job. Just take a look at this graph from a White House Covid-19 press briefing yesterday:\n\nEven with Delta endemic in the country, the vaccines are providing extraordinary protection against infections severe enough to land folks in the hospital. In a recent CDC study of infections and hospitalizations in Los Angeles County, they report that on July 25, the hospitalization rate of unvaccinated people was 29.2 times that of fully vaccinated persons. 29 times the protection is astounding for a medical intervention.

          "description": "Only 34 paintings by Dutch master Johannes Vermeer, art history’s foremost painter of Side Views of People Doing Things Near Windows,  have been known to survive to the present day, so when one of them is restored, it’s a big deal. The Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister in Dresden shared the first image of the completed restoration of Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window — and you might notice a pretty big change on the wall behind the girl.\nThe painting has been in the museum’s collection for more than 250 years and the hidden Cupid had been known about since an x-ray in 1979 and infrared reflectography in 2009. It had been assumed that the artist himself had altered the composition by covering over the painting of Cupid.\nBut when a major restoration project began in May 2017, conservators discovered that the paint on the wall in the background of the painting, covering the naked Cupid, had in fact been added by another person. When layers of varnish from the 19th century began to be removed from the painting, the conservators discovered that the “solubility properties” of the paint in the central section of the wall were different to those elsewhere in the painting.\nFollowing further investigations, including tests in an archaeometry laboratory, it was discovered that layers of binding agent and a layer of dirt existed between the image of Cupid and the overpainting. The conservators concluded that several decades would have passed between the completion of one layer and the addition of the next and therefore concluded that Vermeer could not have painted over the Cupid himself.\n\n\nThere is a certain aesthetic amenity to the bare wall in the altered version but maaaybe the original Cupid lends the painting some figurative meaning?\nTags: art   Johannes Vermeer",

          "description": "I love this post from the NYPL comparing astronomical drawings by E.L. Trouvelot done in the 1870s to contemporary NASA images.\nTrouvelot was a French immigrant to the US in the 1800s, and his job was to create sketches of astronomical observations at Harvard College’s observatory. Building off of this sketch work, Trouvelot decided to do large pastel drawings of “the celestial phenomena as they appear…through the great modern telescopes.”\n\n\nHe made drawings of Saturn, Jupiter, aurora borealis, the Milky Way, and more. Here’s his incredible drawing of sun spots compared to a recent image of the Sun’s surface:\n\n\nAnd his drawing of a solar eclipse compared to a recent image:\n\n\nCheck out the post for more examples of Trouvelot’s work.\nTags: art   astronomy   E.L.

I’d played in the yard, and smashed tennis balls against walls for hours, and built model airplanes, and listened to my records at night in my room. I’d slept with cats for company, and ridden my bike, and struggled in school, and, later in life, gone to bars, and then quit going to bars, and smoked cigarettes and pot, and fallen in love, and argued and made up, and refused to speak to my father, and suffered my mother. None of this had stopped my dying. Writing had not stopped my dying. The Twelve Steps had not stopped my dying. Therapy hadn’t stopped it, and my old friends couldn’t stop it; nor could Regan. No one could.\n\n\n Tags: Donald Antrim",

Whether developing green roofs, living walls, abundant indoor courtyards, or balconies that connect interior and exterior spaces, the urge to intertwine nature and architecture has never been more apparent.\nEmbracing this ubiquitous trend, Evergreen Architecture surveys a broad spectrum of residential, institutional, urban, and rural spaces. But as change occurs and solutions to the climate crisis are being integrated on the ground, many new questions are posed. How do residents keep moss-covered walls alive? How can a skyscraper uphold the weight of hundreds of trees?\n\n\nYou can order the book from Bookshop. (via colossal)\nTags: architecture   books   Evergreen Architecture",

For the New Yorker, Margaret Talbot shares some images from Brittany Powell’s The Debt Project, a series of 99 portraits of Americans in debt.\nPowell set about photographing ninety-nine Americans who owe money (she ended up with a few more, including herself, but started with that figure as a reference to the slogan “We are the ninety-nine per cent”) and asked them to handwrite accompanying text about how much they owe, and to whom. The litany of reasons gets repetitive, because that’s how it goes — difficulty finding a job in one’s field after graduating during the recession, a bad marriage, a bad divorce, vertiginous rents in expensive cities, medical crises, many, many student loans. Occasionally, there are epic and awful variations: one woman’s mother took out credit cards in her name and, in a ten-year period, racked up “a mortgage worth of debt” to fund her “compulsive shopping and hoarding habits.”\n\n\nThe Debt Project is also available in book form.\nTags: Brittany Powell   finance   Margaret Talbot   photography",

Bought as a calf in Sudan by a European animal dealer in 1860, Jumbo found fame first at the London Zoo and later as the centerpiece of the Barnum & Bailey Circus in the US. Jumbo was so beloved in London that news of his sale to P.T. Barnum prompted 100,000 children to write to Queen Victoria, urging her to nix the deal. In the video above, Andrew McClellan recounts Jumbo’s too-short (and probably unhappy) life and the impact he had on society.\nThe word “jumbo” hadn’t been known or used in the English language before he came along and has since become the byword for anything humongous or supersized. So every time we use the word “jumbo jet” or “jumbotron”, we’re actually referring back to Jumbo the elephant.\n\n\n(thx, ben)\nTags: Jumbo   language   video",

A lot of people are armchair travelers and can’t go to remote places, but they get the satisfaction of seeing the beauty through my photos. I’m always happy to be able to share that beauty. I also think that images help build pride among employees as reminders of the vast and irreplaceable places that BLM manages.”\n\n\nYou can follow Wick’s continuing photo adventures on Instagram.\nTags: Alan Taylor   Bob Wick   photography",

My favorite door jingle is from the Paris Metro — I never knew where it came from: \nIn Paris, a simple “A” note plays as the doors shut. This is also a throwback, a sound that mimics the vibrations of a mechanical part that is no longer in use on any of the system’s trains. “But for a half century Parisians and visitors alike became used to that sound, so we decided to keep it, and recorded a synthesized version,” said Song Phanekham, a communications manager for the Paris transit system. “It’s a tribute to the heritage of the Paris Metro.”\nIn Tokyo, each station has its own custom jingle to signal departures. In Rio de Janeiro, the subway’s door chime pays homage to bossa nova. In Vancouver, the doors still close to a three-note sound that was recorded in the 1980s on a Yamaha DX7. (“The hallmark of any mid-80s pop song,” said Ian Fisher, manager of operations planning at British Columbia Rapid Transit Company.)\n\n\nYou can listen to more sounds of subway doors closing in these three videos recorded by Ted Green.\nTags: audio   cities   music   subway   Ted Green",

          "description": "I released Acorn 7.1 yesterday, which has some new features, changes, and bug fixes. There's nothing earth shattering in here, just another release that continually improves Acorn. The full release notes are available as always.\nThere is one little, yet devilish, bug fix in the 7.1 release. It took a while to track down and the fix of course was super easy.\nSoon after the release of MacOS 11.5 I started getting crash reports. Lots of crash reports. They all had similar stack traces, pointing to something in the guts of Apple's Key Value Observing code (_NSKeyValueObservationInfoGetObservances specifically).\nBut the messages from my customers in the crash reports all pointed to wildly different things. Someone was using flood fill, and got a crash. Someone else was changing the size of the …",

          "description": "Allen Pike: The Persistent Gravity of Cross Platform\nIn practice, the tradeoff is about more than “cheap vs. good”. Unintuitively, sometimes native tech can actually be the cheapest way to achieve a certain goal, and sometimes cross-platform technologies actually lead to better products, even for very well-funded companies. So what is a useful way to think about the tradeoff?\nOver the last decade I’ve talked to people at hundreds of companies about how they’re developing and supporting apps, helping them evaluate and plan native and cross-platform app work. While there are a lot of factors that go into this technology decision, there’s one that I think is particularly illuminating.\nMore and more apps written with web tech (such as Electron) are showing up on the Mac desktop everyday. I understand why, but I don't have to like it.",

This represents a slight, but not enormous pay raise for Sanheim, which will certainly be a polarizing outcome within the eyes of the fanbase. Still, the price and term is around what most models projected the still-young defender to receive. Evolving-Hockey.com’s contract projections pegged Sanheim at two years for $4.303 million AAV, which isn’t too far off from what the Flyers ended up paying.\n\n\nSanheim is coming off of a season where he had awful on-ice results despite solid underlying numbers. Costly mistakes and strong analytics have been staples of the big blue liner’s career in Philadelphia, making him an interesting case for arbitration. Looking at the whole of Sanheim’s work in the NHL within the context of an advanced metrics-driven perspective would likely argue that he’s worth more than the deal he was signed to.\nImage via Evolving-Hockey.com\n      Sanheim’s three year player card.\n  \nThe Flyers now technically have -$643,523 in cap space, but are fine due to the ability to exceed the salary cap by ten percent in the offseason. However, it does put them in a precarious position when it comes to running a 23-man roster as opposed to just 22:\nBarring a trade or reworking of the roster, it now looks like the Flyers are going to roll with a 22-man roster to start the year. That's the only way they can fit everyone under the $81.5 million cap ceiling, to my eyes. Can't fit 23 without moving somebody out.\n— Charlie O'Connor (@charlieo_conn) August 21, 2021\n\n\n\nWith the season just 55 days away, signing Sanheim solidifies the outlook of the roster heading into 2021-22.",

          "description": "Durham’s City Council staggers its elections and its six council members, plus the mayor, each serve two-year terms. This year, the mayor’s seat is wide open, after incumbent mayor Steve Schewel declined to run for re-election to a third term. Wards I, II, and III also feature races, with incumbent council members seeking re-election in Wards I and II. A primary election for mayor and seats for Wards I and II take place October 5, with the top two vote getters in each race advancing to the general election on November 2. Early voting in Durham’s municipal primary begins next week for these three seats, and we will make endorsements in all three races. The Ward III seat drew only two candidates, so they will automatically advance to the general election ballot. We will not endorse in this race as candidate AJ Williams is the son of our staff writer, Thomasi McDonald, who covers Durham. Read questionnaires from some of the candidates below and check back this Wednesday for our endorsements!",

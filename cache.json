AirPods Beanies come just after the 20th anniversary of the iPod, and will be appealing to iPod fans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple began selling iPod Socks in 2004, offering a set of six for $29. When they were introduced, Steve Jobs jokingly referred to them as a \"revolutionary new product\" and they became a favorite of Apple users as they were able to fit several devices, even early iPhones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAirPods Beanies feature a two-tone knit design, similar to the iPod Sock, and they're available in four pastel colors: Glacier, Peach, Indigo, and Sage. The Beanies are sized to fit all AirPods models, including the original AirPods, AirPods 2, AirPods 3, and AirPods Pro.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Beanies are close to identical to the original iPod Socks, though they're shorter to fit the AirPods and come in a series of fresh colors. The Beanies can be slipped off for wireless charging purposes or when in use, and they offer protection for the AirPods while they're tucked in a bag or a pocket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNative Union is selling the AirPods Beanies in a set of four for $19.99 and they can be purchased from the Native Union website.\nTag: Native Union\nThis article, \"Native Union Brings Back iPod Socks, But for AirPods\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The DOJ sent new subpoenas to Apple's business partners over the summer, and has assigned more staff to the probe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecifics have yet to be nailed down, but The Information's sources believe that the investigation will lead to a lawsuit. Apple has been under investigation by the DOJ for two years now, and the probe is part of a broad investigation that has seen the Justice Department looking into Apple, Google, Facebook, and Amazon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe DOJ has spoken with Apple critics that include Spotify, Match Group, Basecamp, and Tile, all companies unhappy with Apple's App Store policies and control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAttorneys involved in the probe will eventually give the Department of Justice a recommendation on whether or not to file a lawsuit against Apple, but no formal recommendation has been made at this point in time, and there's still a possibility that no case will be filed as the investigation is ongoing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple recently came out largely ahead in its lawsuit with Epic Games and the judge decided that Apple had not violated U.S. antitrust law, but The Information's sources say that the DOJ's investigation is broader because it is also examining issues like Sign in With Apple, App Tracking Transparency, and location tracking restrictions, so the Epic loss will not hinder a potential DOJ case.\nTags: App Store, DOJ, antitrust\nThis article, \"U.S. Department of Justice Likely to File Antitrust Lawsuit Against Apple\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "In what has become one of the most defining moments in Apple's history, today marks the 20th anniversary of Steve Jobs introducing the original iPod at a small press event at the Town Hall auditorium at Apple's former Infinite Loop headquarters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbove is a snapshot of what Apple's website looked like on October 23, 2001, the day the iPod was announced, courtesy of the Wayback Machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur news story covering the original iPod's announcement is still live on our website, and the comment section on the story is well known for containing several negative comments about the device. One commenter described the iPod as \"far from revolutionary\" and another commenter wrote \"all this hype for something so ridiculous!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, the iPod turned out to be one of the most important products in Apple's history and, along with the original iMac, helped the company become successful again after it flirted with bankruptcy in the late 1990s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJobs famously pitched the iPod as offering \"1,000 songs in your pocket,\" and he unveiled the device by pulling it out of his own pocket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"With iPod, Apple has invented a whole new category of digital music player that lets you put your entire music collection in your pocket and listen to it wherever you go,\" said Jobs in a press release. \"With iPod, listening to music will never be the same again.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe iPod has since become a niche product for Apple, with the iPod touch being the only remaining model available for purchase today after the iPod classic was discontinued in 2014 and the iPod nano and iPod shuffle were discontinued in 2017. In fact, as of this week, the iPod touch's product page is only advertised in the footer of Apple's website.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple's former senior vice president of the iPod team Tony Fadell reflected on creating the iPod in an interview published yesterday.\nThis article, \"Today Marks the 20th Anniversary of the iPod\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

He believes the upcoming model will represent the biggest redesign of the MacBook Air since 2010, with a rumor earlier this week claiming that the notebook will have a similar design as the 24-inch iMac, including off-white bezels around the display and a variety of color choices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGurman also expects a larger iMac with Apple silicon, a new Mac mini, a new iPhone SE, and a new iPad Pro to launch after the calendar turns to 2022.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing the unveiling of redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with Apple's next-generation M1 Pro and M1 Max chips this week, the only Intel-based Macs remaining in Apple's lineup include a low-end 21.5-inch iMac targeted at the education market, the 27-inch iMac, the high-end Mac mini, and the Mac Pro tower. \nRelated Roundup: MacBook Air\nTag: Mark Gurman\nBuyer's Guide: MacBook Air (Caution)\nRelated Forum: MacBook Air\nThis article, \"Gurman: Apple Event in November Unlikely, New MacBook Air With Biggest Redesign Since 2010 to Launch Next Year\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Impressively, he said that he \"really got started\" with developing the device in May 2001, just five months before it was introduced by Jobs. \"It was nonstop, seven days a week,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Jobs unveiled the iPod at a small press event at its former Infinite Loop headquarters, the device was not fully finished, according to Fadell. Nevertheless, he said Jobs handed out this early version of the device to the media in attendance, along with a collection of 20 CDs containing the music that had been pre-loaded onto the device.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFadell added that by 2005, Apple was starting to look into the cell phone market. As he has shared in previous interviews over the years, Fadell said his team toyed with prototypes of a full-screen iPod with a virtual click wheel, adding that the Mac team had separately designed a \"massive capacitive touchscreen the size of a pingpong table.\" Apple ultimately launched the iPhone with a multi-touch display in 2007.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe full interview is a worthwhile read over at CNET for those interested in the days leading up to the original iPod's launch two decades ago.\nTag: Tony Fadell\nThis article, \"Tony Fadell Reflects on Creating the iPod Ahead of Device's 20th Anniversary\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

It has previously been reported that Apple is keen to bring at least some of the manufacturing related to the vehicle to the U.S., with particular focus on the batteries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple allegedly wants to use lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery for its electric vehicle, partly because they are cheaper to produce than more expensive lithium batteries that need cobalt and nickel.

          "description": "As we previously reported, we've received confirmation from Apple that 16-inch MacBook Pro models configured with an M1 Max chip feature a new High Power Mode that is designed to maximize performance during intensive, sustained workloads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMacRumors has since obtained an internal Apple document that indicates users will be able to enable High Power Mode in System Preferences on a 16-inch MacBook Pro with an M1 Max chip running macOS Monterey. Apple says that High Power Mode will provide users with \"extreme performance\" for tasks like color grading 8K ProRes video.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's still unclear exactly how High Power Mode will function, but we should get a closer look at the feature next week when reviews of the new MacBook Pro models are shared. Based on code-level references to High Power Mode in the macOS Monterey beta found by MacRumors contributor Steve Moser, we do know that the feature \"will optimize performance to better support resource-intensive tasks\" and \"may result in louder fan noise.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple only confirmed High Power Mode being available on 16-inch MacBook Pro models with an M1 Max chip, so we presume the feature is not available on any 14-inch MacBook Pro models or any models configured with the M1 Pro chip.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9to5Mac's Filipe Espósito was first to discover references to High Power Mode in the macOS Monterey beta last month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two configurations of the 16-inch MacBook Pro with the M1 Max chip available, including one with a 10-core CPU and a 24-core GPU and another with a 10-core CPU and a 32-core GPU. Pricing starts at $3,099 for this level of performance.

The situation fizzled out just days later, and REvil mysteriously removed all documents and extortion threats related to Apple from its website.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe've heard nothing further about REvil's attack on Apple since then, but it turns out there was a multi-country operation underway to take down the ransomware group. According to Reuters, several government agencies teamed up to hack REvil and take it offline this week.\nOne person familiar with the events said that a foreign partner of the U.S. government carried out the hacking operation that penetrated REvil's computer architecture. A former U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the operation is still active.\nREvil's \"Happy Blog\" that was used to leak stolen documents has been taken offline and is no longer available. The hacker group went offline back in July as well after law enforcement and intelligence specialists were able to hack into REvil's computer network, but it returned last month and servers previously compromised by the government were again used for this second takedown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREvil was also responsible for a May cyberattack on the Colonial Pipeline that caused gas shortages on the East Coast of the United States.\nThis article, \"Ransomware Group That Stole Apple's MacBook Pro Schematics Taken Offline in Multi-Country Operation\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Google collects 30 percent from a subscription during the first year, and then drops that to 15 percent for each subsequent year if customers keep a continuous subscription going.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGoogle recognizes that many businesses are unable to benefit from the fee cut because of the continuous rule that it has, so Google is dropping all subscription fees to 15 percent \"from day one,\" effectively removing prior year-long subscription requirement. The fee cut was also previously limited to the first $1 million in revenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple also offers reduced 15 percent subscription fees from day one, but that's limited to developers who are part of its App Store Small Business Program, which is available to those who earn up to but don’t exceed to $1 million in a calendar year. For other developers that are not part of that program, Apple takes a 30 percent cut until a subscriber has been subscribed to a service for 12 months. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll apps in the Google Play Store will pay 15 percent instead of 30 percent for all subscriptions, but Google also plans to lower the fee even further for some ebooks and on-demand streaming music service apps. Fees could be as low as 10 percent for apps that fall into these categories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGoogle is making the change to subscription fees as it faces increased regulatory pressure much like Apple. It too is in the same legal battle over in-app purchases as Apple with Epic Games, and it is under the same scrutiny in the United States and other countries.\nTags: Google, Google Play\nThis article, \"Google Lowers Play Store Subscription Fee From 30% to 15%\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Nvidia says the new gaming experience rivals the latest game consoles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEach GeForce NOW cloud SuperPOD includes more than 1000 GPUs that deliver over 39 petaflops of graphics horsepower. Nvidia says each instance is 35 teraflops of performance, nearly 3x that of an Xbox Series X.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the new membership tier, games can run at up to 1440p on Macs and PCs, and at up to 120 frames per second.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccess to the GeForce NOW RTX 3080 membership is priced at $99.99 for six months, which is introductory pricing. GeForce NOW founders and Priority members have early access to pre-order starting today, and pre-orders will open more broadly to all gamers later in the month. Quantities are limited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt $99.99 for six months, access to the RTX 3080 rigs costs twice as much as the $49.99 priority membership. Those who choose the highest-tier plan get longer session allowances in addition to the higher quality streaming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeForce NOW offers several free games, but for the most part, titles need to be purchased to be played.

So you can charge four 61W MacBook Pro models all at the same time, or do a 16-inch MacBook Pro, an iPad, an iPhone, and another accessory all at full charging speeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's a 100Wh battery so though it provides up to 245W, it can still be brought on an airplane. The Battery Pack has enough juice to charge a MacBook Pro or MacBook Air up to two times with 27,000mAh capacity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA built-in OLED display lets you know your battery status, providing real-time battery information like charging status, capacity, time to recharge, and the power being drawn from each port.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the 245W GaN charger or any 100W USB-C PD charger, the battery pack can be charged up in as little as an hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHyper is offering the new products on Indiegogo, and pricing for the battery pack starts at $149, while pricing on the 245W GaN charger starts at $99. A combo deal is available with Hyper offering both the battery pack and charger for $239.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Indiegogo.

The auction company says the VideoPad 2 headed to auction is the only surviving concept prototype, and it is estimated to fetch up to $12,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe three VideoPad prototypes were based on a conceptual design sketch drawn by Apple's former CEO John Sculley, but the devices were ultimately scrapped by Steve Jobs upon his return to Apple in the late 1990s, according to Bonhams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe prototype VideoPad 2 features a hinged flip-top design with two screens, although the top screen appears to be missing. The device was apparently going to have a built-in camera for video conferencing, two speakers, a memory card slot, a power socket, and a phone line input, but it was ultimately never released to the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe prototype was purchased from an Apple engineer in Palo Alto in 1999, and it comes in its original black leather carrying case with the Newton logo, according to Bonhams. More details are available on the auction website.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso headed to auction is an early prototype of the original Macintosh, an early prototype of the original iPad, and a handwritten letter from Steve Jobs.\nThis article, \"Apple VideoPad Device Scrapped by Steve Jobs Headed to Auction\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Industry insiders told TrendForce that the new skin-detect sensor may allow the third-generation AirPods to detect water content in the wearer's skin for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Apple's tech specs page indicates that the third-generation AirPods do not support Conversation Boost, a feature designed to help people with mild hearing challenges stay more connected in conversations. Conversation Boost is only available on the AirPods Pro following a firmware update earlier this month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConversation Boost uses the AirPods Pro's beam-forming microphones to boost the volume of a person talking in front of you, making it easier to listen to a face-to-face conversation, and there is also an option to reduce ambient noise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple unveiled the third-generation AirPods on Monday with a similar design as the AirPods Pro, but no active noise cancellation or silicone ear tips. Key features include improved sound quality with Adaptive EQ and spatial audio, longer battery life, a MagSafe charging case, IPX4-rated water and sweat resistance, and more.

          "description": "The increasingly popular privacy-focused browser Brave is officially saying goodbye to Google as its default search engine, replacing the world's most popular search engine in favor of \"Brave Search,\" the company announced in a blog post.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBrave Search is Brave's answer to customers wanting a \"privacy-preserving\" search engine, and it's built using Brave's own \"independent index, and doesn't track users, their searches, or their clicks.\" Brave users in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada will automatically have Brave Search set as their default search engine in the address bar instead of Google. Brave Search is also replacing other default browsers, such as Qwant in France and DuckDuckGo in Germany. \r\n\r\n Today's Brave desktop browser update (version 1.31), as well as the Brave Android app (version 1.31)* and the Brave iOS app (version 1.32) all automatically offer Brave Search as the default for new users in these five countries, with fully localized versions in non-English geographies. Brave users can easily choose a different search option if they prefer by managing their search engine settings. Brave Search is also available in any other browser at search.brave.com.\nUsers in all countries will still be able to revert their default search engine back to Google or DuckDuckGo, but Brave is hoping the majority won't. Brave Search does not display any ads in its current form, but the company announced plans this week to change that. Brave says that the free version of its search engine will \"soon be ad-supported,\" with the company planning to offer a premium ad-free plan later down the line. Brave launched Brave Search in beta earlier this summer. \nTag: Brave\nThis article, \"Brave Browser Says Goodbye to Google As Default Search Engine, Replaces With 'Privacy-Preserving' Brave Search\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Apple is planning to introduce a new 27-inch iMac in early 2022, according to Display Supply Chain Consultants CEO Ross Young. This information comes from both Young's tweets and additional details that he shared with MacRumors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYoung told MacRumors that the 27-inch display for the iMac will feature mini-LED backlighting, which likely means that it will have XDR branding. Young tweeted that Apple is currently planning to release the new iMac in the first quarter of 2022.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYoung added that the 27-inch iMac display will feature ProMotion, allowing for an adaptive refresh rate between 24Hz and 120Hz. At the time this story was published, Young did not say what the display's resolution would be, but the current 27-inch iMac has 5K resolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple has introduced a few other products with mini-LED displays, including the 12.9-inch iPad Pro earlier this year and the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro this week. Young expects Apple's recent leadership with mini-LEDs to continue with the new iMac.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile he made an initial misstep with this rumor in stating it was for a standalone display rather than an iMac, Young has proven to be very accurate with display-related rumors, having accurately forecasted that the new iPad mini would feature an 8.3-inch display and that the new MacBook Pro models would feature ProMotion. Young has 25 years of experience in the display industry and seems to be well connected with sources within the supply chain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate 9:45 p.m.: This article has been rewritten to reflect a correction issued by Young. While he initially stated the 27-inch mini-LED display was for an external monitor, he is now saying it is destined for an updated iMac. A monitor could come later.\nRelated Roundup: iMac\nTag: Ross Young\nBuyer's Guide: iMac (Neutral)\nRelated Forum: iMac\nThis article, \"Apple Rumored to Launch 27-Inch Mini-LED iMac With ProMotion in Early 2022 [Updated]\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "The new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros both feature a notch, a first for the Mac. Given we've never had a notch on a Mac, there are some questions over how macOS handles the notch, and more specifically, how the mouse pointer does. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe predicament about how the mouse pointer handles the notch has been a question floated across Twitter and Reddit over the last 24 hours or so since the new MacBook Pro's announcement. An animation posted on Reddit portrayed two main possibilities, one in which the mouse pointer travels behind the notch, being invisible to the user. The other option showcased the mouse pointer traveling around the notch. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new MacBook Pros will begin arriving next week, but thankfully, we don't have to wait that long to get an answer. Linda Dong, an Apple designer, has confirmed on Twitter that the macOS pointer travels behind the notch, allowing users to essentially hide the mouse pointer from view. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis behavior will come in handy, fundamentally making the notch a hiding place for the mouse pointer. This may come in good use, for example, when users want to more easily hide the mouse pointer while they watch a video. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple is taking steps to make the notch less of an annoyance for most customers in day-to-day use. When macOS apps are in full-screen mode, Apple adds an artificial black bar to the top of the display that hides the notch. Developers can, however, opt to allow their apps to make full use of the entire screen real estate, notch included.

Cleaners should not be used, but if a deep cleaning is required, a 70 percent isopropyl alcohol solution can be used to moisten the cloth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple has been shipping a similar Polishing Cloth with the nano-texture Pro Display XDR since its launch. Based on the instructions provided with that cloth, the new cloth can be hand washed with dish soap and water should it become dirty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs of now, the Polishing Cloth is not available in Apple's retail stores, though retail locations could potentially begin offering stock next week when the MacBook Pro models launch.\nThis article, \"Apple's New $19 Polishing Cloth is Sold Out Until Late November\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

It also means that those who buy the new 16-inch MacBook Pro can use compatible chargers from third-party brands to charge the notebook if they prefer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe continue to learn smaller details about the new MacBook Pro models that Apple didn't mention during its \"Unleashed\" event, including that fast charging is only possible with the MagSafe port on the new 16-inch MacBook Pro, whereas the 14-inch model can be fast charged using either MagSafe or any of the Thunderbolt 4 ports. This shouldn't be a big deal given that the MagSafe port has no other use than charging, but it's worth knowing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKey features of the new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro include Apple's next-generation M1 Pro and M1 Max chips, the return of an HDMI port and SD card slot, mini-LED displays with a ProMotion adaptive refresh rate up to 120Hz, up to 10 hours longer battery life, and more. The notebooks can be ordered now and launch on Tuesday, October 26.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple's new 140W power adapter is included with the new 16-inch MacBook Pro and it is also sold separately for $99.\nRelated Roundup: 14 & 16\" MacBook Pro\nBuyer's Guide: 16\" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)\nRelated Forum: MacBook Pro\nThis article, \"Apple's 140W Power Adapter is Company's First GaN Charger, Supports USB-C Power Delivery 3.1\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "With the debut of the new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models, Apple has brought a fast charge capability to the Mac for the first time, allowing users to charge the laptop battery up to 50% in just 30 minutes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut there's a difference between models with this feature that Apple didn't really mention. While both models can be charged over Thunderbolt or MagSafe, only the 14-inch MacBook Pro can fast charge over the USB-C/Thunderbolt 4 ports as well as ‌MagSafe‌. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy contrast, the 16-inch MacBook Pro is limited to fast charging over the ‌MagSafe‌ port. The reason is likely down to the fact that the Thunderbolt 4 ports are capable of charging at a maximum of 100W, and the 16-inch MacBook Pro uses a 140W power adapter, so the same fast charging speed can't be claimed. Meanwhile, the 14-inch model uses a 67W power adapter for the 8-core machine and a 96W power adapter for the 10-core machine, so it doesn't reach the maximum TB4 power delivery. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis limitation on the 16-inch MacBook Pro is unlikely to be a big deal for most users, as the ‌MagSafe‌ 3 port is made exclusively for charging and won't be engaged for any other reason. That said, this difference between the two seems worth highlighting given the various cable/dock setups prospective owners could be envisioning for their workflow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new MacBook Pro models can be ordered now, with pricing starting at $1,999 for the 14-inch model and at $2,499 for the 16-inch model. The notebooks will begin arriving to customers and launch in stores on Tuesday, October 26.\nRelated Roundup: 14 & 16\" MacBook Pro\nTag: MagSafe\nBuyer's Guide: 16\" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)\nRelated Forum: MacBook Pro\nThis article, \"14-inch MacBook Pro Can Fast Charge Via Thunderbolt, But Fast Charge Limited to MagSafe in 16-inch Model\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Apple on Monday announced third-generation AirPods, featuring an updated design, improved sound quality, and an extra hour of battery life compared to the second-generation ‌AirPods‌, which offer five hours of listening time. However, what Apple didn't make very explicit in its marketing is that to get six hours out of its latest earphones, spatial audio must be disabled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs noted in Apple's fine print, if spatial audio is enabled, users can expect up to five hours of battery. That's the same amount of listening time offered by the second-generation ‌AirPods‌, which don't support spatial audio, but still half an hour longer than the AirPods Pro. That said, ‌AirPods Pro‌ can also be pushed to five hours of listening time by turning off Active Noise Cancelation and Transparency mode.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new ‌‌AirPods‌‌, as rumored, feature a design similar to the ‌AirPods Pro‌ but without silicone eartips or Active Noise Cancelation. The new ‌‌AirPods‌‌ also include Adaptive EQ, which adjusts frequencies in real-time based on what a user is listening to deliver even improved sound quality. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Apple's specifications page for the new ‌AirPods‌, the third-generation ‌AirPods‌ do not support the iPhone 6, ‌iPhone‌ 6 Plus, and the ‌iPhone‌ 5s, because they require iOS 13 to work. They also drop support for the iPad mini 2 and ‌iPad mini‌ 3 alongside the sixth-generation iPod touch. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new third-generation ‌AirPods‌ are being offered alongside the second-generation ‌AirPods‌, as well as the higher-end ‌AirPods Pro‌.

The ‌M1‌ Max chip is the highest-end Apple silicon chip available, and alongside the added performance, the 16-inch MacBook Pro with the ‌M1‌ Max chip comes with another difference — it's heavier, slightly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we've already highlighted, the new 16-inch MacBook Pro is heavier and thicker than the previous model. The added thickness and weight come from a new chassis, more ports, and other factors.

Apple does not plan to offer the MagSafe Charging Case on its own, so there will be no upgrade option. The standard AirPods Pro wireless charging case can be used with MagSafe anyway because it's a Qi-based wireless charging protocol.

The version with a 10-core CPU and 16-core GPU is actually priced starting at $2,499.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause there are two different 14-inch models with different ‌M1‌ Pro chips, Apple is also offering two separate power adapters. The 8-core CPU ‌M1‌ Pro MacBook Pro comes with a 67W power adapter and the 10-core model comes with a 96W power adapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 67W power adapter is a new addition to Apple's online store and is available for $59 on a standalone basis, while the 96W version was previously available and is priced at $79.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the 16-inch MacBook Pro models, there's also a middle-tier graphics option available as an upgrade. Both the entry-level and mid-level machines can be upgraded with an ‌M1‌ Max chip with 10-core GPU and 24-core GPU that's a middle of the road option between the 16-core GPU and the 32-core GPU.

With the new changes, Apple now only highlights the HomePod mini, which now comes in brand new colors. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple announced ‌HomePod‌ in 2018 as its first major home-centric product, focused around delivering high-quality audio combined with the integration into services, such as Apple Music and Siri. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPriced at $349 at launch and eventually decreased to $299, Apple struggled to market the ‌HomePod‌ in a way appealing to the masses, yielding lower sales than the company was likely aiming for. Additionally, ‌Siri‌, which powers the ‌HomePod‌ experience, continues to grapple with catching up to the capabilities of Google's smart assistant and Amazon's Alexa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple followed up the full-sized ‌HomePod‌ with the ‌HomePod mini‌ last year, and today added new colors for the smaller speaker. The ‌HomePod mini‌ features a significantly smaller design than the original ‌HomePod‌, but continues to feature the same ‌Siri‌ experience, powered by ‌Apple Music‌ and third-party services. Unlike the original ‌HomePod‌ selling for $299, the ‌HomePod mini‌ is priced at $99. The ‌HomePod mini‌ recently became available in more countries, including Austria, Ireland, and New Zealand. \nRelated Roundup: HomePod\nTag: October 2021 Apple Event\nBuyer's Guide: HomePod (Don't Buy)\nRelated Forum: HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home & Auto Technology\nThis article, \"Apple Removes References to Original HomePod From Website, Months After Discontinuation\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Apple did add a \"beta\" label next to hidden Universal Control settings in System Preferences, suggesting that the feature will be considered a public beta when it launches, just like iCloud Private Relay on iOS 15.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUniversal Control will allow for a single mouse, trackpad, and keyboard to be used across multiple Macs and/or iPads side by side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther new macOS Monterey features include AirPlay to Mac, a redesigned Safari browser, a Shortcuts app, spatial audio in FaceTime, and more.

Brazilian regulatory agency Anatel has approved the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ models and provided photos of the dock that Apple is using internally, with the information shared by Brazilian site <a href=\"https://macmagazine.com.br/post/2021/10/15/anatel-homologa-versoes-celular-do-apple-watch-series-7/\r\n\r\n\">MacMagazine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ dock is clearly designed for diagnostics, and it has a two piece construction. An Apple Watch charging puck fits into the bottom piece, and then a second piece housing the Apple Watch itself fits over that and aligns with bolts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrior to the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌, Apple included a diagnostic port on Apple Watch models, with the port hidden under the band. It's not clear why Apple has shifted to wireless diagnostics, and it's also not known how fast the wireless data transfer is. It likely uses USB 2.0 with speeds up to 480Mb/s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nThe diagnostic port on Apple Watch Series 6 models and older\n\r\n\r\nThere is no word on whether the wireless data module added to the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ could ever have a consumer-facing application, but for now, it's for Apple's internal use only.\nRelated Roundup: Apple Watch Series 7\nBuyer's Guide: Apple Watch (Buy Now)\nRelated Forum: Apple Watch\nThis article, \"Proprietary Dock Apple Uses to Wirelessly Troubleshoot Apple Watch Series 7 Surfaces in Regulatory Database\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The new AirPods are rumored to feature a similar design as the AirPods Pro, but without Active Noise Cancellation, and they could have improved sound quality and some other new features.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe third-generation AirPods have already been manufactured and are ready to launch, according to Wedbush's supply chain checks, which increases the likelihood that they will be announced during the Apple Event next week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEarlier this week, an account on Chinese social media platform Weibo known as @PandaIsBald also claimed that third-generation AirPods will be announced at the Apple Event next week. Last month, the same account accurately revealed that Apple would announce the ninth-generation iPad at its September event.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis would be the first update to the standard AirPods since the second-generation AirPods were released in March 2019. The second-generation AirPods are priced at $159 with a wired charging case and at $199 with a wireless charging case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn update to the AirPods Pro is not expected until next year.\nRelated Roundup: AirPods\nTag: October 2021 Apple Event\nBuyer's Guide: AirPods (Don't Buy)\nRelated Forum: AirPods\nThis article, \"AirPods 3 Ready to Launch and Likely to Be Announced at Apple Event Next Week, Analyst Says\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Apple Stores‌ globally are opening up right around 8:00 a.m. local time to allow customers to pick up reserved devices and make walk-in purchases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStay tuned to MacRumors tomorrow because we'll have an ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ review and comparison, along with more coverage coming next week. If you have a new ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌, make sure to share photos below and let us know what you think!\nRelated Roundup: Apple Watch Series 7\nBuyer's Guide: Apple Watch (Buy Now)\nRelated Forum: Apple Watch\nThis article, \"First Apple Watch Series 7 Orders Arriving to Customers in New Zealand and Australia\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Apple has hired a new software lead for the HomePod team as part of an effort to better compete with smart home speakers from Amazon and Google, reports Bloomberg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nThe Syng Cell Alpha\n\r\n\r\nAfrooz Family, an audio engineer who worked at Apple from 2012 to 2016 has rejoined the company and is leading software development on the ‌HomePod‌/Apple TV team. Family co-founded speaker company Syng alongside former Apple design team member Christoper Stringer. Syng is known for the super expensive Cell Alpha, which boasts \"triphonic\" audio technology that's able to create an immersive, dynamic sound field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple has struggled to get the ‌HomePod‌ to catch on since its launch in 2018. The initial version of the speaker was priced at $350 and boasted higher-quality audio than competitors, but it was just not as popular as much more affordable smart speaker options from Samsung and Google.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe original ‌HomePod‌ was discontinued earlier this year with Apple instead opting to focus on the $99 HomePod mini, which is smaller and much more appealing due to its lower price tag.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGoing forward, Apple plans to create a combined ‌HomePod‌, ‌Apple TV‌, and FaceTime device that will serve as an all-in-one entertainment option. According to Bloomberg, such a device could be released as early as 2023.\nRelated Roundup: HomePod mini\nBuyer's Guide: HomePod Mini (Neutral)\nRelated Forum: HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home & Auto Technology\nThis article, \"Apple Aims to Boost HomePod Sales With New Audio Software Lead\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

This means that in 2021, the latest flagship iPhone model costs $437 more to buy in each of the 38 countries it's available in than it used to.\nWhile the price increase comes alongside more advanced technology and increases in production costs, the increase also comes as a result of inflation and Apple having to sometimes increase prices to counter economic growth. \r\n\r\nHowever, many countries have experienced inflation and growth in purchasing power in the years between, and our research shows that Apple have risen iPhone prices 26% higher than local inflation rates. This means that local affordability for a flagship iPhone costs people around the world $154 more in real terms than the first models they could purchase.\nAs part of its research, Self has created an interactive map that highlights the changes in ‌iPhone‌ prices in real-world terms as a percentage of GDP over the last 14 years in more than 30 countries around the world. According to that map, the United Arab Emirates has witnessed the largest increase in the price of the ‌iPhone‌, with the latest model costing more than double what it did when it originally launched.\nThis article, \"Over The Last 14 Years, iPhone Prices Have Gone Up More Than 80%\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

It's similar to Sidecar, but works with both Macs and iPads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLuna Display users who own a USB-C version of the dongle can upgrade to the new software to use the device interchangeably between Macs and PCs. That means Mac users who have a Luna Display can also now use it with PCs, connecting a secondary ‌iPad‌ to a PC to serve as an extra display.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Luna Display apps have been rearchitected to support both PCs and Macs, and the update also introduces a faster setup flow for M1 Macs. The Luna Display can be purchased from the Astropad website.\nTag: Luna Display\nThis article, \"Luna Display 5.0 Turns an iPad Into a Second Screen for a Windows PC\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Apple used the port for diagnostic purposes when servicing an Apple Watch, such as to restore watchOS over a wired connection with a special tool.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lack of a diagnostic port on Apple Watch Series 7 models likely explains the addition of the 60.5GHz wireless data transfer module.

The Apple Watch Series 7, going on sale this Friday, is also experiencing delays in shipments, with some high-end models leading into early December.

The game tasks players with outrunning the sun as they fly a bird across procedurally generated islands.

The complimentary coverage is automatically included with the purchase of a qualifying new Apple product.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe addition was brought to our attention today by MacRumors reader Jack Jacobs, but based on recent updates to the AppleCare+ terms and conditions in Australia, it appears the change was implemented last week, on September 30.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe complimentary AppleCare+ period provides the same coverage as a paid AppleCare+ plan, including coverage for up to two incidents of accidental damage, according to the terms and conditions. After the complimentary coverage expires, customers may purchase AppleCare+ as a one-time purchase or on a monthly basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's unclear why Apple implemented this change, but it could relate to strong warranty protections under Australian Consumer Law.

          "description": "Apple Watch Series 7 pre-orders began minutes ago and some configurations are already facing extended delivery estimates into November on Apple's online store in the United States, including some aluminum and stainless steel options.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome customers have expressed their frustration that Apple did not provide more details on Series 7 configurations and pricing prior to pre-orders beginning, forcing some people to decide which model they wanted to purchase in the heat of the moment. For customers who did not manage to pre-order their desired Apple Watch for launch day delivery, some configurations will likely be available for Apple Store pickup on launch day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple Watch Series 7 pricing starts at $399 for aluminum models, $699 for stainless steel models, and $799 for titanium models. Apple has finally updated its Apple Watch Studio page that helps with choosing a case, size, and band, and the Apple Watch comparison page is also now updated to reflect the Series 7's tech specs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple Watch Series 7 will begin arriving to customers and launch in stores on Friday, October 15.\nRelated Roundup: Apple Watch Series 7\nBuyer's Guide: Apple Watch (Buy Now)\nRelated Forum: Apple Watch\nThis article, \"Apple Watch Series 7 Already Facing November Delivery for Some Models\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "The iPhone 14 won't rely entirely on a hole-punch cutout to house the TrueDepth camera system, possibly meaning Apple may retain the notch alongside a hole-punch design, according to a new rumor from Weibo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has reported that for at least the high-end 2022 iPhone models, Apple will use a hole-punch design, similar to those of some flagship Android smartphones. Following Kuo's report, Apple leaker Jon Prosser shared renders of what he claims to be the design of the ‌iPhone 14‌. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEven if the ‌iPhone 14‌ introduces a hole-punch design, it will be hard for Apple to abandon the notch altogether, according to a now-deleted post on Weibo from @PandaIsBald. The account, which accurately predicted that the ninth-generation iPad would be announced at the September Apple event, claimed that it is \"unlikely\" that Apple will replace the notch entirely with a hole-punch cutout, and instead, the ‌iPhone 14‌ may continue to feature a notch but with a smaller footprint. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro, Apple did make the notch smaller in width but slightly taller. Apple did this by shrinking the component sizes of the TrueDepth camera system and reengineering the internals. Apple this year also moved the earpiece to the top of the bezel, freeing up space in the notch. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReporting on a hole-punch design for next year, Apple analyst ‌Ming-Chi Kuo‌ did not provide details on how Apple will house Face ID on the high-end ‌iPhone 14‌ models if it uses a hole-punch design. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nToday's rumor from Weibo claims that Touch ID will not be making an appearance under the display next year, meaning Face ID may continue to be the only biometric authentication option available to ‌iPhone 14‌ users. \nRelated Roundup: iPhone 14\nThis article, \"iPhone 14 Unlikely to Rely on Hole-Punch Design Entirely and May Keep Notch, No Under-Screen Touch ID, Leaker Claims\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Johnson wondered whether Google had decided to disable AMP in ‌iOS 15‌ due to the prevalence of Safari extensions that feature AMP-blocking features.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nIt's a bug specific to iOS 15 that we're working on. We expect it will be resolved soon.\n— Danny Sullivan (@dannysullivan) October 6, 2021\n \n\r\n\r\nThat Google search results do not include AMP links in the Safari browser on ‌iOS 15‌ is a bug, according to Google's public search liaison Danny Sullivan. In a tweet, Sullivan said that Google is working on a fix and that the issue should be resolved soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor those unfamiliar with AMP, it stands for \"Accelerated Mobile Pages\" and it is a feature that's designed to make webpages load faster on mobile devices. AMP pages are cached, allowing them to be presented to users more quickly, but it's something that is not always popular with users because some website features are disabled when AMP is used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Google does re-implement AMP links, iOS 15 Safari extensions like Amplosion are available to redirect AMP links to standard webpages.\nRelated Roundups: iOS 15, iPadOS 15\nTags: Google, Safari\nRelated Forum: iOS 15\nThis article, \"Google to Fix Bug That Disables Safari AMP Search Results on iOS 15 Devices\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The feature is available on all iPhones with a Neural Engine, including the iPhone 8 and newer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHalide said its Macro Mode first checks which one of your iPhone's camera lenses can focus the closest and switches to it. Then, the feature provides ultra-precise focus control down to the sub-millimeter to ensure the photo looks sharp. Finally, an AI-based feature called Neural Macro further enhances close-up details of the photo once shot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nHalide's sample photo shot with its Macro Mode on iPhone 12 Pro\n\r\n\r\nIf you already have an iPhone 13 Pro model, Halide said its Macro Mode essentially stacks on top of Apple's Macro Mode, resulting in \"staggeringly close, microscope-like shots that are even more highly magnified.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo turn on Macro Mode in the Halide app, first tap the AF button to get into manual focus, and then tap the flower button. The feature is available as a free update for all existing users, with version 2.5 of the app rolling out on the App Store today. For new users, the Halide app is priced at $2.99 per month or $11.99 per year, or $49.99 as a one-time purchase.  \nTag: Halide\nThis article, \"Halide's New Macro Mode Lets You Take Close-Up Photos Without an iPhone 13 Pro\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

On Android devices, multiple payment services can offer contactless payments using the NFC chip, but on the ‌iPhone‌, no rival services are allowed to leverage the NFC hardware.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Commission's preliminary concerns also reportedly include Apple's terms and conditions on how ‌Apple Pay‌ should be used in merchants' apps and on websites. Concerns may have been raised by ‌Apple Pay‌'s wide reach and better user experience on the ‌iPhone‌ compared to other services, and accelerated by the growth of contactless payments during the global health crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe EU competition enforcer is now believed to be preparing a statement of objections to charge Apple with anticompetitive conduct, which is expected to be sent to the company next year. The antitrust charge could put Apple at risk of a large fine and force it to open the NFC chip to rival payment systems in Europe.

There are eight colors to choose from, and the line below the tab can be customized to be between 1 and 7 pixels wide. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Zhenyi notes, the extension works best with the \"Separate\" tab layout selected and \"Show color in tab bar\" disabled in the Tab section of Safari's Preferences. Zhenyi also cautions that ActiveTab will not work reliably if you have so many tabs in a window that the tab bar becomes scrollable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActiveTab is available for $1.99 on the Mac App Store, with no in-app purchases, no ads, and no tracking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(H/T MacStories.)\nTag: Safari\nThis article, \"Safari 15 Extension for Mac Helps You Tell Which Tab Is Active\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "A number of banks are currently pressuring Visa to make changes to the way it processes some payments made via Apple Pay, moves that would reduce the fees the banks pay to Apple for certain transactions, reports The Wall Street Journal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the heart of the issue are automatic recurring payments like memberships and streaming services. Visa is aiming to change the way it issues tokens for ‌Apple Pay‌ cards such that Apple would only receive a transaction fee on an initial subscription payment and not on subsequent transactions.\nWhen Apple introduced Apple Pay in 2014, the iPhone had already clobbered music players, cameras and GPS systems. Banks and card networks worried it also would displace card payments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBanks agreed to pay Apple 0.15% of each purchase made by their credit cardholders. (They pay a separate fee on debit-card transactions.) Those fees account for most of the revenue that Apple makes from its digital wallet, according to people familiar with the matter.\nAside from the fee arrangement, Apple garnered several other concessions from credit card issuers as it rolled out ‌Apple Pay‌, and in exchange, Apple agreed not to launch its own credit card network to go up against Visa and Mastercard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the launch of Apple Card in partnership with Goldman Sachs, Apple has become more of a direct competitor to other banks, and some bank executives have reportedly been angered by Apple's move and are seeking ways to reduce the payments they make to Apple.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple has unsurprisingly informed Visa that it objects to the proposed change that would reduce the fees it receives on recurring transactions, so it remains to be seen whether Visa will follow through on its plans, which are scheduled to go into effect next year.\nRelated Roundup: Apple Pay\nTags: wsj.com, Visa\nRelated Forum: Apple Music, Apple Pay/Card, iCloud, Fitness+\nThis article, \"Banks Pressuring Visa to Cut Back on Apple Pay Fees\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

While Apple's larger cores are more power hungry, they're still a lot more energy efficient.\nTwo new CPU microarchitectures feature in the A15, both for the two performance cores and the four efficiency cores, which are likely made on a 5nm+ process, which TSMC refers to as N5P, a \"performance-enhanced version\" of its 5nm process that allows for higher maximum frequencies. \r\n…",

In the four-minute video, Intel invites 12 supposed Apple fans to a focus group showcasing features of \"upcoming devices\" that were, in fact, PCs that are already on the market. The ad was spotted earlier by French website MacGeneration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nThe video starts out by saying that many Apple fans only care about Apple products, and Intel attempts to change that viewpoint. The supposed Apple fans are ushered into a room that looks similar to an Apple Store, creating the impression that they are being shown new Apple products, but the devices are actually PCs powered by Intel processors. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Intel's Ryan Shrout, the ad features each participant's \"real\" reactions instead of scripted ones. \"It's surprising to see how many people that utilize tech still don't know the capabilities of the PC,\" he said in a tweet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ad is part of Intel's #GoPC marketing campaign that it launched last year after Apple started transitioning to custom Apple Silicon chips in Macs.

Apple has also inverted its shading of tabs, with an active tab now having darker shading and inactive tabs having lighter shading. The change has annoyed Gruber and other users, as evidenced by this Reddit thread with nearly 1,000 upvotes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The design is counterintuitive,\" wrote Gruber. \"What sense does it make that no matter your settings, the active tab is rendered with less contrast between the tab title and the background than background tabs? The active tab should be the one that pops.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a Safari 15 window with two tabs open, especially from the same website, Gruber said determining which tab is active is basically a guessing game. Gruber acknowledged that it is easier to discern the active tab when more than two tabs are open, but he said the confusion with exactly two tabs should have been reason enough to scrap the design change.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I can't tell you how many times I closed the tab that I needed because of this,\" one Reddit user expressed in frustration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for users who do not like the new design, Apple has not made any changes to the shading of tabs in either the Safari 15.1 beta or the latest version of the experimental Safari Technology Preview browser.\nTag: Safari\nThis article, \"Safari 15 Users Say New Tab Design is Counterintuitive\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Those changes resulted in the iPhone 12 being 21% more expensive for Apple to build than the ‌iPhone 11‌.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the run-up to the launch of the iPhone 13 and ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ last month, a report suggested that due to increased costs for chip production, Apple would increase the price of the iPhone 13 as a means of compensating. That did not occur, and Apple instead kept the same price points for the ‌iPhone 13‌, on top of introducing more aggressive carrier subsidies. Another report suggested that Apple was looking at new ways to assemble the cameras in an ‌iPhone‌ to save costs.\nRelated Roundup: iPhone 13 Pro\nTag: iPhone 13\nBuyer's Guide: iPhone 13 Pro (Buy Now)\nRelated Forum: iPhone\nThis article, \"iPhone 13 Pro Costs Around $20 More to Build Compared to the iPhone 12 Pro, Despite Being the Same Price for the Customer\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Apple has toggled end-to-end encryption for Safari bookmarks in iCloud, further expanding the type of user data that the company fully encrypts, offering the highest level of privacy and data protection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpotted on Reddit, an update to Apple's \"iCloud security overview\" page has indicated that alongside Safari tabs and history, Safari bookmarks are now end-to-end encrypted, meaning no one, not even Apple, can access users' saved Safari bookmarks. Based on the timing of the update, Apple likely did this change around the release of iOS and iPadOS 15. Apple didn't respond to a request for comment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith Safari bookmarks now an added data point that's end-to-end encrypted, what remains not end-to-end encrypted is worth noting. ‌iCloud‌ backups, for example, are only protected using 128-bit AES encryption, alongside Photos, Reminders, Notes, and more. In recent months, Apple has come under pressure to make iCloud Photos and ‌iCloud‌ backups fully end-to-end encrypted, but the company has yet to make those changes.\nTag: Apple privacy\nThis article, \"Apple Makes iCloud Safari Bookmarks End-To-End Encrypted\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Cheng said the iPhone survived unscathed, adding that the move was the kind of calculated risk that Jobs was known to take as a showman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The memory underscores the kind of lengths Jobs went to in order to make an impression,\" wrote Cheng. \"Imagine how disastrous it would've been if that iPhone had broken or shut down in front of so many journalists.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nJobs famously introduced the original iPhone as if it were three separate products: a widescreen iPod with touch controls, a revolutionary mobile phone, and a breakthrough internet communications device. The crowd at Macworld San Francisco erupted with cheerful applause upon realizing that Jobs was referring to a single device.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJobs passed away October 5, 2011 at the age of 56.

          "description": "After its first event of the fall, Apple is on track to hold a Mac focused event within the next month, where it will debut brand new MacBook Pros with a faster \"M1X\" Apple silicon chip, an updated design, and improved display technology, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple last year held its Mac event in November, but in the past, it has held Mac events in October. Till now, there's been some unknown about whether Apple will stick with its November or October timeframe for this year. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his latest Power On newsletter, Gurman says the company is poised to announce M1X powered MacBook Pros within the next month, noting that \"Apple typically does its major new Mac introductions in October. So stay tuned.\" In the paywalled section of the newsletter, Gurman also reiterated what we can expect performance-wise from the new machines. \r\n\r\nThe Apple M1X chip, the likely name for a more graphics-intense and professional-focused M1 chip, is indeed still on tap for 2021. We'll likely see it show up first in a new range of MacBook Pros in the next month and a higher-end Mac mini at some point. The M1X has been developed in two variations: both with 10 CPU cores (eight high-performance and two high-efficiency) and either 16 or 32 graphics cores.\nPrevious report suggests that alongside the new MacBook Pros, Apple may also announce a redesigned Mac mini. Apple last month announced the iPhone 13, Apple Watch Series 7, a new generation iPad, and the sixth-generation iPad mini, and besides new Macs, the company is also rumored to be releasing third-generation AirPods before the end of this year.  \nRelated Roundups: MacBook Pro 13\", MacBook Pro 16\"\nTags: Mark Gurman, 14-Inch MacBook Pro\nBuyer's Guide: 13\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy), 16\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)\nRelated Forum: MacBook Pro\nThis article, \"New MacBook Pros Likely to Launch at Apple Event This Month, Says Gurman\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The poster of the photos claimed that they are working for a carrier who was testing the Series 7 before it officially goes on sale \"later this fall.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe've so far only seen the Series 7 in Apple's marketing and promotional materials, and the company has yet to announce a date for when it will be available for purchase. The images shared today offer us our first hands-on look at the Series 7 with its larger and more expansive display. Despite rumors, the Series 7 does not feature flat-edges but instead \"more rounded and softer corners,\" which allows the display to curve slightly over the sides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe larger display is one of just a few design changes for the Series 7 compared to the previous generation. The Series 7 features an improved IP6X rating for dust and water resistance but internally maintains the same CPU as the Apple Watch Series 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile there certainly could be more internal changes for the Series 7, we'll have to wait until we get our hands on the watch itself to learn about them.

          "description": "Apple has canceled its plans to release an updated iPad Air with an OLED display next year due to concerns around quality and costs, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said today in an investor note obtained by MacRumors. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn March, Kuo reported that Apple had an ‌iPad Air‌ with an OLED display in the pipeline for next year. Today, Kuo has revised his prediction, saying that will not be the case since Apple has canceled those plans due to costs and performance not meeting the company's expectations. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKuo had previously stated that the 11-inch iPad Pro would be receiving a mini-LED display next year, and Kuo today doubled down on that claim by saying it will be the \"focus of [the] iPad line in 2022.\" Currently, only the 12.9-inch iPad Pro includes the newer mini-LED technology. One reason Kuo states that Apple had canceled its OLED ‌iPad Air‌ is that it may have been detrimental to the sales of the forthcoming 11-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ with a mini-LED display. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Apple plans to stick with an LCD display for the ‌iPad Air‌, Kuo says the company continues to research and develop newer display technologies for the ‌iPad‌ line. A report last week suggested that Apple and Samsung had abandoned their joint plans to develop an OLED display for a forthcoming updated 10.9-inch ‌iPad Air‌. \nRelated Roundup: iPad Air \nTag: Ming-Chi Kuo\nBuyer's Guide: iPad Air (Neutral)\nRelated Forum: iPad\nThis article, \"Kuo: Apple Cancels Plans to Release iPad Air With OLED Display in 2022, Plans to Stick With LCD Technology\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Apple CEO Tim Cook is in New York City today for a meeting with Margrethe Vestager, the European Commissioner for Competition, according to a person familiar with the matter. Vestager was a keynote speaker at Fordham University's annual Conference on International Antitrust Law and Policy earlier today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's unclear when Cook and Vestager are scheduled to meet or what topics will be on the agenda. In April, the European Commission informed Apple of its preliminary view that it abused its dominant position for the distribution of music streaming apps through the App Store by charging high commission fees on Apple Music rivals like Spotify, which had filed a complaint against Apple with the European Commission in 2019.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile in New York, Cook stopped in at Apple's retail store in the SoHo neighborhood this morning, sharing a photo of his visit on Twitter. Cook also tweeted a photo of his visit to the International Center of Photography.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nGood morning Apple SoHo! 👋 Great to feel the excitement and energy, from team members and customers alike! pic.twitter.com/frOZVgvbMa\n— Tim Cook (@tim_cook) October 1, 2021\n \n\r\n\r\n\nReally enjoyed the “INWARD” exhibit at @ICPhotog earlier today.

In the United Kingdom and Canada, the situation seems direr, with all configurations showing up with up to a one-month delay, also with in-store stock varying. The iPhone 13 and ‌iPhone 13‌ mini seem less affected, with expected shipment delays and availability across all stores.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple's CEO Tim Cook warned during the company's last earnings calls that industry-wide shortages could be impacting iPhone production in the coming months, added on top of increased demand for the latest iPhones. The ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ Max are likely doing well thanks to ProMotion displays and improved camera capabilities. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly analyst numbers suggested that pre-order demand for the new high-end iPhones was initially off to a strong start. Despite the phones having started shipping to customers one week ago, the supply continues to be dry. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple's suppliers are reportedly struggling to keep up with Apple's high demand for the new iPhones amid the global health crisis and new energy regulation in China.

Apple has continued on updating the Apple Watch each year, and in 2021, we're expecting the Apple Watch Series 7 to see a release sometime in October.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe original 2015 Apple Watch now qualifies for Apple's \"vintage\" list, which includes devices that Apple stopped distributing for sale more than five years ago and less than seven years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor most products, the vintage designation means that they're no longer eligible for repairs at the Genius Bar in Apple retail stores or from Apple Authorized Service Providers, but Apple does offer extended repairs of some vintage products and in locations where extended repairs are required by law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn another couple of years, the original Apple Watch will move on to the obsolete list and hardware service will be entirely discontinued.\nRelated Roundup: Apple Watch Series 7\nBuyer's Guide: Apple Watch (Don't Buy)\nRelated Forum: Apple Watch\nThis article, \"Original Apple Watch Added to Apple's 'Vintage Product' List\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "iOS 15 adoption has reached an estimated 19.3% since the software update was released September 20, according to mobile analytics company Mixpanel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMixpanel measures iOS adoption based on visits to websites and apps that use its mobile analytics SDKs, so the data is not official. Apple has yet to share iOS 15 adoption stats, having last reported an 85% adoption rate for iOS 14 back in June.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\niOS 15 adoption appears to remain slower than iOS 14 adoption so far, and there are likely several reasons for that, including Apple providing iOS 14 users with the option to continue receiving important security updates, several iOS 15 features being delayed, and iOS 15 suffering from a handful of early bugs that still need to be fixed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, Apple said an issue preventing some iPhone 13 users from using the Unlock with Apple Watch feature will be fixed in an upcoming software update. The feature is designed to let you unlock your iPhone while wearing a mask, but some users have encountered an \"Unable to Communicate with Apple Watch\" error message.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere's another iOS 15 bug where performing an iCloud Backup can result in photos saved from an iMessage conversation that is later deleted to disappear from the Photos app, intermittent touchscreen issues on iPhone 13 models, and other problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple is currently beta testing iOS 15.1, which includes a fix for the Unlock with Apple Watch bug at a minimum, but there is no timeframe for the software update's release. It's quite possible that Apple will opt to release a smaller update such as iOS 15.0.1 to more quickly address some of the bugs and security vulnerabilities that have surfaced.\nRelated Roundups: iOS 15, iPadOS 15\nTag: Mixpanel\nRelated Forum: iOS 15\nThis article, \"iOS 15 Suffering From Several Bugs as Adoption Rises to Nearly 20%\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

At the time of writing, the Podcasts app, which has faced a flurry of criticism, has a 2 out of 5-star rating out of 156 reviews, with other Apple apps varying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPresently, no Apple app has a perfect five-star rating, with even the company's built-in Stocks app struggling to reach a 4 out of 5 grade. Notes has earned just 3.6 out of 5, while even Maps, which has received more attention from Apple over the years, has only a 3 out of 5 ratings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy opening up its apps to ratings and reviews, Apple and its teams are now better able to receive more direct feedback for individual apps on ‌‌iPhone‌‌ and iPad. In light of recent ‌App Store‌ litigation, this move also nixes a potential criticism from Apple's detractors, who could have previously argued that by withholding ratings and reviews for pre-installed apps, Apple was being anti-competitive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple's pre-installed apps, such as Mail, Podcasts, and Maps, don't receive regular ‌App Store‌ feature updates as other apps do; instead, their major updates are bundled with significant iOS releases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple refines and tweaks all of its apps with each minor update for iOS and iPadOS, but significant changes, such as the ones that are likely to be requested through ratings and reviews, are not expected to come sporadically throughout the year, but instead, users will have to wait for the next major iOS release to see if their wishes have come true.\nTag: App Store\nThis article, \"Apple Now Lets Customers Rate and Review Pre-Installed Apps on the App Store\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "iOS 15 was released last week with a long list of new features, but there is one change that is proving to be an annoyance to users.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Apple TV, users who prefer not to input text using the Siri Remote can use a nearby iPhone or iPad to type. Whenever a text field appears on the Apple TV, a notification appears on the iPhone or iPad, and after tapping the notification, users can use the on-screen keyboard on the iPhone or iPad to enter text on the Apple TV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe issue is that iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 no longer offer a way to disable the Apple TV keyboard notifications, despite Apple advertising this option in its tvOS 15 User Guide. On devices running iOS 14 and iPadOS 14, there was a toggle switch for turning off the notifications in Settings > Notifications > Apple TV Keyboard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe inability to turn off the Apple TV keyboard notifications has prompted complaints from users. We've reached out to Apple to see if the company will consider reintroducing the toggle switch in a future software update, and we'll update this story if we hear back.\nRelated Roundups: Apple TV, iOS 15, iPadOS 15\nBuyer's Guide: Apple TV (Buy Now)\nRelated Forums: Apple TV and Home Theater, iOS 15\nThis article, \"iOS 15 Doesn't Offer a Way to Disable Apple TV Keyboard Notifications\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Facebook says it is testing the ability for Instagram Reels content creators to share their Reels to the Facebook audience, but doing so is entirely in a creator's control. Reels on Facebook can consist of effects, text, music, and more. Facebook's concept of Reels is wholly inspired by TikTok and follows its lead in featuring short, \"entertaining,\" and trend-making videos. \nWith the ability to create reels and have their Instagram reels suggested to people on Facebook, creators — whether they’re just starting out or already have a large following — will have more ways to express themselves, grow their communities and reach new audiences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReels on Facebook can consist of music, audio, effects, and more. You can find them in News Feed or in Groups, and when viewing a reel on Facebook, you can easily follow the creator directly from the video, like and comment on it, or share it with friends.\nFacebook also today announced it would be offering a new bonus program for content creators in hopes of spurring-up more Reels content on its platform.

          "description": "Apple and Google have been asked to provide compliance plans for a newly amended law in South Korea that bars both tech giants from forcing developers to using their in-app purchase payment system for their respective app distribution platforms, Reuters reports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn August, South Korea passed an amendment to an existing law that bans Apple and Google from mandating developers to use their own proprietary in-app purchasing system. Apple's in-app purchasing system gives the company a 15 to 30% commission for all purchases made and has been a hot topic for Apple and the discussion around the App Store for some time. Under the new law in South Korea, which is yet to go into effect, Apple and Google will be required to allow developers to use third-party payment methods within their app. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple has in recent weeks made some concessions to its ‌App Store‌ policy, most notably pivoting to allow developers to add links in their apps to external websites where purchases can be made. Those concessions come short of the mandate created by South Korea, which permits developers to add third-party payment methods directly within their app. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple has continued to call its in-app purchasing system the most trusted and safest way for customers to make purchases. Still, in light of recent decisions in its lawsuit against Epic Games, the Cupertino tech giant is being forced to rethink its model. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple operates the ‌App Store‌ under a single set of policies worldwide, and while the law passed in South Korea pertains to South Korean users, it will undoubtedly play a domino effect across the globe. With the mid-October deadline now set in South Korea for Apple and Google, we'll likely see how this decision could have repercussions around the world for Apple users soon. \nTags: App Store, South Korea\nThis article, \"Apple and Google Given Mid-October Deadline in South Korea for Filing Plans to Allow Outside Payment Systems in Apps\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The post implies that customers should possibly consider replacing some of Apple's default iOS apps, such as Photos, Safari, Calendar, Reminders, and even Phone, with Google's equivalent of those apps, including Google ‌Photos‌, Google Chrome, Google Calendar, Google Tasks, and Google Voice, respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGoogle continued to encourage customers to utilize the wide variety of ‌widgets‌ its iOS apps offer. Google said that if the right Google ‌widgets‌ are placed on the home screen, users will \"never even have to leave\" their home screens to stay caught up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the blog post, users can also use \"Smart Stacks\" to stack different Google ‌widgets‌ on top of each other, allowing iOS to determine which widget is most relevant to show at any one time. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, Google recommends that users replace Safari with Google Chrome as the default iOS browser, allowing all system-wide links and Spotlight web suggestions to open in Chrome. Google closed by saying it hopes ‌iPhone 13‌ users, who just started receiving their new iPhones last week, will consider bringing \"the best of Google\" to their device instead of just simply purchasing an Android smartphone or device.\nTags: Google, Android\nThis article, \"Google Basically Wants Your iPhone 13 Home Screen to Look Like Android\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Apple today increased the price of its Beats Flex headphones from $49.99 to $69.99, a pricing shift that may be related to supply chain constraints that have raised the costs of components across the industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst released last October, the Beats Flex made headlines at launch because of their low price compared to other Apple headphone options, and they have been a popular purchase option since. The Beats Flex are a follow-up to the BeatsX, and feature an in-ear design with a wire between the left and right earbuds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiven their low price, the Beats Flex may have been more susceptible to cost pressures than some other Apple products. At $20 more expensive, the Beats Flex are still a very affordable option to get into the Apple headphone ecosystem, but it's not quite as impressive a deal as before. They come in Black, Flame Blue, Yuzu Yellow, and Smoke Gray, and offer much of the same seamless connectivity functionality available with Apple's more expensive Beats options.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAuto-play/pause is included, and the Beats Flex last for up to 12 hours without needing to be recharged. There's a Fast Fuel charging option that offers 1.5 hours of playback, and they feature Find My integration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pricing change of the Beats Flex was first noticed by Twitter user Pedro Henrique and was highlighted by 9to5Mac. The Beats Flex can be purchased from the Apple Store, but Amazon currently has them on sale for as low as $37, so those considering a purchase should buy them on Amazon before prices go up.\nTags: Beats, W1, Beats Flex\nThis article, \"Apple Increases Price of Beats Flex Headphones From $50 to $70\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The Information first reported the DOJ’s\ninterest in the sign-in button earlier this year.\nI strongly suspect that it’s not “Sign In With Apple” itself, but the corresponding App Store rule that requires any app that offers the ability to sign in with a third-party service (which, in practice, primarily targets Google and Facebook, and to a lesser degree Twitter) to also support “Sign In With Apple”.\nThe probe also is examining complaints about how Apple places\nrestrictions on location tracking that its own apps don’t have to\nfollow, said several people with knowledge of the matter.\nThey say that, but I get prompted to re-confirm allowing Apple’s iOS Weather to always access my location frequently. I wish I could make it ask me less frequently. The complaints aren’t really about Apple’s apps having access to your location but the system itself having access.\nOf particular concern to app developers is Apple’s App Tracking\nTransparency, which requires iPhone and iPad users to\naffirmatively opt in to let developers share personal information,\nsuch as a device’s location, with other apps and advertisers.\nApple isn’t requesting such permission to track users of its own\napps, giving it an unfair advantage in serving ads in the App\nStore and elsewhere, developers argue. Apple has said that unlike\nFacebook, it doesn’t share user data with others for advertising\npurposes, and that the changes are designed to protect customers’\nprivacy.\nApple should just abandon selling ads in the App Store. I’m convinced the antitrust problems those ads are causing (not to mention loss of developer goodwill) are not worth the money they generate.\n ★",

But we’ve been\nwaiting 20 years to share it with you.\nIt doesn’t look anything like an actual iPod, but that’s how prototypes work. But the date on this unit was remarkably late in development:\nClearly, this revision of the prototype was very close to the\ninternals of the finished iPod. In fact, the date there — September 3rd, 2001 — tells us this one was made barely two\nmonths before it was introduced.\nI’ve long wondered whether Apple might have intended to introduce the iPod a few weeks earlier than they actually did, but, well, September 11 happened. I remember that original iPod introduction as much for the iPod itself as for it feeling like a welcome early step in the world returning to normalcy. \nTony Fadell:\nThis is a P68/Dulcimer iPod prototype we (very quickly) made\nbefore the true form factor design was ready. Didn’t want it look\nlike an iPod for confidentiality - the buttons placement, the size\n- it was mostly air inside - and the wheel worked (poorly).\nJohn Whitley:\n@panic @cabel HA! GOT YOU! I have seen exactly that before. I\nwas one of the PortalPlayer firmware devs who went onsite @ the\nApple skunkworks site during iPod main development, and again to\nmake sure the GM release shipped on time.\n ★",

If this is your plan, when you go to the Music app on your devices, the interface will just be Siri suggestions and your listening history.\nWhat more do you get for the regular price of $10/month? Spatial audio (potentially cool, depending upon how carefully the songs were mastered), lossless audio (borderline pointless), offline mode (downloading songs to your device), custom playlists, lyrics, and music videos. For me, it’d be really weird not to be able to browse an available index of all music (artist → album → song), but a lot of people just ask Siri for whatever.\nSpotify doesn’t offer a plan like this (screenshot for posterity) — but Spotify doesn’t have its own voice-driven hardware. Amazon Music has a $4/month Echo plan that is very similar, but Amazon’s Echo plan is limited to one single Echo device or Fire TV.\n ★",

That’s a weird one. In the initial WWDC previews, the Bookmarks toolbar button was removed in Safari on both iOS and iPadOS. In the late summer redesign of Safari 15 for iOS, the Bookmarks toolbar button (which you tap to access a hierarchical menu showing all your bookmarks, and which, crucially, remembers which folder you were in the next time you use it) was back where it belongs: in Safari’s bottom-of-the-screen toolbar.\nYet on iPad — which has much more room for toolbar buttons than iPhone — Bookmarks are still squirreled away in the sidebar that is primarily intended for creating, managing, and switching between Tab Groups. Tab Groups are a clever and I think useful new feature. Bookmarks do not belong over there though. Worse, every time you use the Bookmarks menu over in the sidebar on iPadOS 15, you have to navigate from the root level of your bookmarks each time. It doesn’t remember which folder you were in.\nHere’s hoping that more changes to Safari 15 are coming, on both Mac and iPad.\n ★",

Myke Hurley and\nI will offer post-event coverage after it’s all said and done,\nlive on Relay FM.\nThe event name is “Unleashed”, and the motif is a take on going into warp drive or hyperspace. Greg Joswiak, on Twitter:\nUnleashed! These next six days are going to speed by.\nYou don’t need to be Kreskin to predict that new pro Macs powered by high-performance Apple silicon will be the main attraction. It seems like a surefire bet that we’ll see the new 16- and 14-inch MacBook Pros. I hope we see the new full-size iMacs — 30-inch displays, perhaps? — too. My other hope: MacBook Pros in black or near-black.\nThe slightly weird thing about the event is that it’s on a Monday — Apple generally holds events on Tuesdays. Looking at my notes, I think the last time Apple held an event on a Monday (excepting WWDC keynotes, which of course are always on Monday mornings) was the original iPhone SE event, which was on Monday, 21 March 2016. They might have held that one a day early because the next day was Apple’s courtroom showdown with the FBI regarding the San Bernardino gun massacre.\nWhy hold next week’s event on Monday instead of Tuesday?

          "description": "From an editors’ note appended to a New York Times report over the weekend, about COVID-19 vaccinations for children:\nAn earlier version of this article incorrectly described actions\ntaken by regulators in Sweden and Denmark. They have halted use of\nthe Moderna vaccine in children; they have not begun offering\nsingle doses. The article also misstated the number of Covid\nhospitalizations in U.S. children. It is more than 63,000 from\nAugust 2020 to October 2021, not 900,000 since the beginning of\nthe pandemic.\nThe report is from Apoorva Mandavilli, the reporter who replaced longtime science report Donald J. McNeil on the Times’s COVID beat — the same reporter who last month approvingly quoted an epidemiologist who was against booster shots for adults on the nonsensical grounds that “the added benefit may be minimal — and obtained just as easily by wearing a mask, or avoiding indoor dining and crowded bars.”\nThe difference between 63,000 and 900,000 hospitalized children is not a small error — it’s more than an order of magnitude difference. If nearly a million U.S. children had been hospitalized from COVID-19, our entire perception of this pandemic would be fundamentally different. How did this error even make it past editing? It’s not even a remotely plausible figure given our lived experience of this pandemic.\nHere’s a good example of how mind-boggling this error is. The median household income in the U.S. is about $68,000. Imagine if The New York Times ran a story about economic policy which stated that the average household income in the U.S. was $900,000. That’s preposterous. Yet that’s exactly how bad the science reporting at the Times has gotten — an error of that magnitude regarding a crucial COVID statistic went into print.\n ★",

And that default Weather widget is about to land on tens of millions of iPad screens with the launch of iPad OS 15 this fall. And with that, Apple will be sending tens of millions of dollars (maybe more?) indirectly to weather.com — which, incidentially is now owned by IBM. Insert the Steve Jobs giving the finger image here.\nDo weather.com executives hold some sort of blackmail on the iPad OS dev team within Apple? I can’t come up with a better explanation.\nThe whole situation is bizarre. Apple just redid the Weather app in iOS 15 to be more beautiful. And the widgets reflect that. And they throw it all in the trash compactor when it comes time to drill down on the iPad.\nThe lack of a built-in iPad Weather app was a little weird before, but now that they have a built-in Weather widget that, when you tap it, takes you to The Weather Channel’s janky-assed website, it’s downright bizarre.\n ★",

With his new biweekly series,\n“The Problem With Jon Stewart,” his first challenge is getting\npeople to notice it at all. Apple TV+ is decidedly more plush but\nless entrenched than basic cable.\nFans will find aspects of “The Problem With Jon Stewart” familiar.\nIn front of an audience, he sits at a table for an opening\nmonologue (now wearing a T-shirt and bomber jacket instead of a\nsuit and tie). He twirls his pen, pauses for deadpan stares into\nthe camera, stifles giggles behind his fist and makes\nself-deprecating cracks like, “I am what’s left of Jon Stewart.”\nBreaking from his previous format, the show includes unscripted\nsegments in the show’s writers’ room, where Mr. Stewart and his\nstaff banter over each episode’s topic (expanded on in a weekly\ncompanion podcast). A separate panel discussion captures the\nshow’s sober tone.\nI watched the first episode and was bored to tears. I certainly sympathize with the plight of U.S. veterans who’ve been gravely harmed by the burning of toxic waste, but the show itself felt like a droll hour-long lecture — not a good sign when the show was in fact only 40 minutes long. Strong “When is this going to be over?” vibes. It was like being stuck back in school.\nI’m not saying Stewart can or should only do comedy. I like serious issue-based shows, too, but the good ones, like 60 Minutes, move along at a fast clip. John Oliver’s Last Week Tonight devotes itself to the most serious issues in the world today, but the show is entertaining, fast-paced, and funny as hell. It moves. The premiere of The Problem With Jon Stewart can only be described as “plodding”. I’ll give it another shot this week, but one more like last week’s and I’m out.\n ★",

The company’s stock\nprice has risen nearly 30 percent in the past year, lifted by\nstrong advertising revenue and a spike in use of some products\nduring the pandemic. Facebook is still growing in countries\noutside the United States, and could succeed there even if it\nstumbles domestically. And the company has invested heavily in\nnewer initiatives, like augmented and virtual reality products,\nthat could turn the tide if they’re successful.\nBut Facebook’s research tells a clear story, and it’s not a happy\none. Its younger users are flocking to Snapchat and TikTok, and\nits older users are posting anti-vaccine memes and arguing about\npolitics. Some Facebook products are actively shrinking, while\nothers are merely making their users angry or self-conscious.\nFacebook’s declining relevance with young people shouldn’t\nnecessarily make its critics optimistic.

We don’t\nget anything. And we don’t like this. We know our constituents\ndon’t like this. But if we don’t do these stories, we don’t get\ndistributed. And so it used to be that we did very little of it,\nand now we have to do a lot of it, because we have jobs to do. And\nif we don’t get traffic and engagement, we’ll lose our jobs.”\nHaugen’s whistleblowing jibes exactly with my theory all along: Facebook prioritizes growth and engagement over all else, and when they discovered that polarizing angering content drives engagement more than anything else, they let it fly.

          "description": "Reuters:\nSouth Korean Internet service provider SK Broadband has sued\nNetflix to pay for costs from increased network traffic and\nmaintenance work because of a surge of viewers to the U.S. firm’s\ncontent, an SK spokesperson said on Friday.\nThe move comes after a Seoul court said Netflix should\n“reasonably” give something in return to the internet service\nprovider for network usage, and multiple South Korean lawmakers\nhave spoken out against content providers who do not pay for\nnetwork usage despite generating explosive traffic.\nSome really odd legal decisions and laws coming out of South Korea lately.

          "description": "Jason Snell, Six Colors:\nThe problem is that most people don’t buy a new iPhone every year.\nThe primary upgraders to the iPhone 13 will be coming from the\niPhone 7, or 8, or X, or XS, or XR. For them, several years of\nApple innovations will be rolled into a single purchase. But\nreviews of the new iPhones will not address what happened in 2018,\nor 2019, or 2020.\nHere’s an attempt to provide a little more of a big-picture\noverview for owners of older iPhones who are wondering what’s new\nin the iPhone 13. I’ve simplified matter a little — if you own a\n“plus” or “max” model of iPhone, obviously your phone will be a\nlittle larger, and you may want to consider the direct upgrade to\nthe iPhone 13 Pro Max to continue with your large phone. The\niPhone 13 mini is also a great option for those who prefer a\nsmaller phone with all the same power as the larger iPhone 13.\nThis is a fantastic idea. You just scroll down to whatever iPhone you’re currently using, and boom, there’s a list of the top upgrades you’d experience if you upgrade to an iPhone 13. Apple’s excellent iPhone Compare page has all this information, but the Compare page also tells you everything that’s the same or roughly equivalent between models. Snell’s guide focuses on the big changes from iPhone Old and iPhone New.\n ★",

          "description": "Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai, reporting for Motherboard:\nOn Thursday, a security researcher published details of three\niPhone vulnerabilities that are unpatched as of today. The\nsecurity researcher, whose name is Denis Tokarev, said he decided\nto publish the bugs’ details as well as the source code that makes\nit extremely easy to reproduce and exploit them, because he was\ntired of waiting and felt like Apple ignored him.\nTokarev reported the vulnerabilities to Apple between March 10 and\nApril 29, but the last time he heard back from Apple about the\nthree vulnerabilities was August 6, August 12, and August 25,\nrespectively. Then the researcher said he told Apple on September\n13 he would publish details of the bugs unless he heard back.\nIt was only after he went public with details about the unpatched\nbugs that Apple reached out, according to Tokarev, who shared\nApple’s email with Motherboard.\n“We saw your blog post regarding this issue and your other\nreports. We apologize for the delay in responding to you,” an\nApple employee wrote. “We want to let you know that we are still\ninvestigating these issues and how we can address them to protect\ncustomers. Thank you again for taking the time to report these\nissues to us, we appreciate your assistance.

          "description": "Last April, after posting this photo of my desk setup for my iPad Air review, I got a few questions about the stand I was using to prop up the iPad. The answer was Anker’s $15 Multi-Angle Stand. Last week I posted a similar photo, this time for my iPad Mini review, and I’m still using the same stand. Alas, that stand is no longer available.\nThe closest thing I could find is this $10 copy of that stand from Amazon Basics. It’s such a blatant rip-off of Anker’s stand that ordinarily I wouldn’t link to it, on principle, but, given that Anker’s original is seemingly no longer being produced, a rip-off design is the best we can do. I even bought one to try it out before linking to it. (If you buy one through this link, I’ll earn affiliate revenue that will get me one step closer to buying one of the upcoming Jony Ive/Marc Newson-designed electric Ferraris.)\nAmazon’s multi-angle stand is extremely similar to Anker’s in size, weight, and angles of tilt. But it’s slightly lacking in fit and finish compared to Anker’s. Whereas Anker’s felt like a bargain at $15, this one feels like what you’d expect from a $10 knock-off. My biggest annoyance is that Amazon, for some reason, decided to screen print “Press/Presse” on the button that you quite obviously must press to adjust the tilt. (Why French?) This is as helpful as printing “Press” on the knock of a click pen. And of course they typeset these needless words in Arial. A wee nip of nail polish remover took care of that, though.\nI still recommend it. It folds flat, and when your iPad is sitting in it, the stand effectively disappears.\n ★",

A world premiere trailer on Monday showed fans what they can expect from the island setting, as well as glimpses of gameplay involving the newest Legend, and the return of a favorite weapon from Titanfall 2.\nStorm Point figures to be a huge map, not necessarily with discrete biomes, but with distinctive environments alternating between natural surroundings and building interiors. A Gravity Cannon helps players traverse it, and, of course, Respawn Entertainment developers want players to notice that they can fire weapons, chuck grenades, and use tacticals or ultimates while in transit. Players can slightly control their trajectory to avoid landing on anything dangerous.\nProwlers (they’re the lizard beasts), flyers (the, uh, flying ones), and spiders also will pop up to harass everyone, providing some PvE encounters for you and your squad. We also get a look at the C.A.R. SMG (at 1:30 of the trailer) and Ash’s abilities, including a tether that restrains her opponents — though they can still fire and use other capabilities.\nApex Legends: Escape is the hero-shooter’s 11th season, and it begins Nov. 2.

That new name will start appearing in Overwatch on Oct. 26.\nBlizzard changed McCree’s name as part of a broader plan to remove references to real-life developers and former employees of the studio in the wake of a lawsuit. In July, the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing sued parent company Activision Blizzard, alleging it had fostered a “frat boy culture” that subjected female employees to sexual harassment and gender-based discrimination. \nDevelopers on World of Warcraft and Overwatch have since pledged to remove references to anyone implicated in the lawsuit  — including renaming characters and locations named after employees. That includes former Blizzard Entertainment employee Jesse McCree, whose name was borrowed for Overwatch’s gun-slinging cowboy hero.\nIn August, the Overwatch development team announced it was changing McCree’s name. The team said in a statement that “it’s necessary to change the name of the hero currently known as McCree to something that better represents what Overwatch stands for.” The change, developers said, would impact the planned rollout of an in-game narrative arc that would have focused on McCree.\n“Going forward, in-game characters will no longer be named after real employees and we will be more thoughtful and discerning about adding real world references in future Overwatch content,” developers said.\nThat pledge already extends to Overwatch 2, which previously featured references to former Overwatch game director Jeff Kaplan. Kaplan, who left Blizzard Entertainment in April, was referenced on signage in a pizza shop on the sequel’s New York City map, which has since been revised.",

Wilson looks properly haunted by the emergence. Klei Entertainment, the studio behind Don’t Starve, responded in kind with a clip of the fearsome Deerclops making its pixelated debut. \nOops, I think we mixed something up somewhere. Oh well, I'm sure it will all sort itself out by next month.⚔️ pic.twitter.com/npI35M08Q9\n— Klei (@klei) October 21, 2021\n\n\n\nIt will be interesting to see how these enemies are actually incorporated into gameplay, or whether they’re just fun little Easter eggs.

Although the game largely involves planting and growing crops, it has a big world where you mine, fish, and even date and marry the local townspeople.\nSince its initial release in 2016, Stardew Valley has undergone a series of significant updates that added new crops, new islands to explore, as well as features like local multiplayer.

Things turn appropriately scary once Ash, the newest playable Legend, shows up and commences with the nonchalant stabbings.

Sony announced the end of God of War’s PlayStation exclusivity on Wednesday via a PC announce trailer on YouTube.\nThe game will be available for $49.99 on Steam and the Epic Games Store.

PC features listed on Steam include “high fidelity graphics,” including 4K resolution, DLSS and reflex support for higher frame rates and sharper graphics, and ultra-widescreen support.\nGod of War was originally released in 2018 to critical success; Polygon named it our Game of the Year for its “staggering technical achievement” and fantastic story. Sony is currently gearing up for a PlayStation 5 sequel for 2018’s God of War. God of War Ragnarok was originally slated for a 2021 release date, but was pushed to 2022 in June.

In September, Kratos’ voice actor, Christopher Judge, said Ragnarok was delayed due to his health.\nGod of War’s move away from PlayStation exclusivity continues a trend we’ve seen over the past few years. More and more companies are leaning away from platform exclusivity as the PC becomes home to, well, everything. 2017 hit Horizon Zero Dawn got a PC port last year, too, making God of War only the most recent PlayStation first-party title to make its way to the new platform.",

          "description": "Image: Valve\n    \n\n  \nVerified, playable with some tinkering, or forget it are your options\n Valve is introducing a rating system that will let players know which of Steam’s 50,000 games are compatible with the Steam Deck, the handheld gaming PC due to launch by the end of the year.\nSteam Deck Verified, as the metric is called, will peg a game as fully compatible, partially compatible, or incompatible with the Steam Deck. Officially, these categories are verified, playable, unsupported, and unknown.\n“Any verified game is a great, smooth experience on Deck,” says the narrator in the video above. Playable means “they’ll require a little more manual involvement to configure and play.” Unsupported means the game “just isn’t playable on Deck.” Unknown means the game hasn’t been evaluated yet for its Steam Deck playability.\nVerified games have full controller support, support Steam Deck’s default resolution (1280x800 or 1280x720), and other basic capabilities. The first tab in the Steam Store, as shown on Steam Deck, will only show games that are “great on Deck.” Users’ game libraries will have compatibility badges shown prominently on each title.\nSteam Deck Verified’s official page says Valve is reviewing the entire Steam catalog for its compatibility. A game’s rating may also change, as developers provide post-release support or options that include Steam Deck — or as Steam Deck’s software improves.\nSteam Deck, announced in July, launches in December with units starting at $399. The handheld features a 7-inch touchscreen. Players can also purchase a dock that allows the Steam Deck to run on a TV, like the Nintendo Switch.\nStorage, however, may be a big shortcoming for the Steam Deck. The base model only offers 64 GB; a $529 mid-level option has 256 GB of space; the top-shelf $649 Steam Deck has a 512 GB solid-state drive. Even though the unit can be opened up by users and the hard drives may be replaced, Valve is strongly recommending folks don’t do that.",

The premiere event will include a red carpet pre-show from Riot Games headquarters in Los Angeles.\nArcane will have three acts, each three episodes long (so, nine in all). And unlike most Netflix shows, not all episodes will drop at once: Acts two and three of Arcane will debut on Netflix on Nov. 13 and Nov. 20, respectively.\nAs an incentive to watch episode one on Twitch, fans will get exclusive in-game items for Riot’s titles via Twitch drops during the show.\n“The premiere of the show will be at the center of a global celebration for gamers and fans of the League of Legends IP,” Monday’s statement said. The League of Legends World Championship, which got underway Oct. 8, concludes on Nov. 6.; Riot’s news release noted that last year’s championship drew 49.45 million concurrent viewers, worldwide.\n“Arcane dives into the delicate balance between the rich city of Piltover and the seedy underbelly of Zaun,” the news release said. “While Arcane holds the backstories of League of Legends champions, the series is designed to stand on its own as a complex world filled with moral decisions, breathtaking animation, and suspenseful storytelling.”",

In this case that human is Dr. Ashleigh Reid, the former partner and apprentice of Horizon — who she reunites with in Apex’s new “Stories from the Outlands” video. After Ashleigh betrayed Horizon and was eventually left for dead, she was turned into the Simulacrum Ash, who plays a key role as an antagonist in Titanfall 2.

That’s a monthlong delay for the open-world action-RPG game, which was previously slated to launch in January.\nOn Twitter, the official Elden Ring account said that “the depth [and] strategic freedom of the game exceeded initial expectations,” leading to its delay.\n“Please accept our sincere apologies for keeping you waiting,” FromSoftware said on its official Twitter account. “Your patience and understanding mean a great deal to us.”\nTo soften the pain of Elden Ring’s delay, FromSoftware and Bandai Namco announced a closed network test of the game’s multiplayer component that will run Nov. 12-14. Interested players can sign up for the beta test before Nov. 1 at the game’s website to take part.\n\n\nBandai Namco says that players who are selected for the closed network test will be able to experience the opening hours of Elden Ring during the following dates and times:\nNov. 12: 3 a.m. to 6 a.m. PST\nNov. 12: 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. PST\nNov. 13: 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. PST\nNov. 14: 3 a.m. to 6 a.m. PST\nNov. 14: 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. PST\nElden Ring was originally announced in June 2019 at E3.

Specifically, it took some of the major graphical flaws from the Windows Vista version of the game and ported them into  343 Industries’ historical Halo package. Generalkidd, a Halo YouTuber, broke down some of the biggest changes in a new video.\n\n\nGeneralkidd called out lighting fixes and crossfades, and general visual changes that bring it closer to the original Halo 2. There’s also footage of a major bug fix in the Halo 2 level “The Great Journey,” where a Brute would classically flip a Wraith, rendering it nonlethal to the player. With season 8, the Brute has learned to drive properly, and now poses a threat. Ghosts also self-destruct properly now, an issue that’s been present in the Master Chief Collection since its launch in 2014.\nThe video goes over a whole host of similar changes, and is definitely worth a watch for potential Halo historians. These changes may seem small to many players — and they are, for the most part. But with Halo: The Master Chief Collection acting as a history of one of the most influential and important video game franchises of all time, it’s nice that Halo 2 finally looks like Bungie intended back in 2004.",

Binge’s Chief Content Officer, Allan Ungar, will be producer on the project.\n“I’ve always believed that a live action adaptation of System Shock would be the perfect medium to retell the harrowing story of Citadel station and its rogue AI that subjects the crew to unimaginable horror,” Kick told Deadline. “We’re very excited to see the talented team at Binge bring System Shock to life in horrifyingly real and new ways.”\nOriginally released in 1994, System Shock follows a security hacker on space station Citadel, who must fight against a rogue artificial intelligence named SHODAN. Developed by LookingGlass Technologies and published by Origin Systems, the first-person game is set in a cyberpunk-tinged version of 2072. System Shock was highly influential, with the Bioshock games regarded as successors. (Fun fact: Gone Home supposedly also exists in the same universe as Bioshock and System Shock).\nThe System Shock adaptation will be one of several properties in Binge’s games-leaning original content slate — this, so far, includes a TV adaptation of Ubisoft’s Driver, which is the early aughts, comparatively lower-key competitor to Grand Theft Auto.

Epic Games has updated its return policy for players that demand their V-Bucks back, it announced Tuesday. \nPlayers previously had a lifetime limit on their return requests; if you use them all, that was that. Now, players can make three return requests per year. If you decide that — oops! — this cosmetic item doesn’t quite fit your vibe, you get 30 days to submit a return request. Each request “slot” becomes available again 365 days after it was last used. Basically, there’s a maximum of three return requests to be stacked at once, and once you’ve started using them, one will be refreshed per year.\n\n\nOf course, you can’t get your real money back — you just get the V-Bucks you spent returned. But it’s a welcome change for players with recent buyer’s remorse. Plus, you’d be surprised how easy it is to accidentally buy Fortnite skins on console.\nEpic said the request slots won’t work for stuff like the Battle Pass, Battle Pass levels, and Llamas, which are not returnable.

This upcoming preseason is no exception, and fans can expect big changes to Summoner’s Rift on PC. \nOn Thursday, Riot released a video called “Preseason 2022 and the State of the Game,” in which the developer discussed new champion balance — and admitted that some recent champions have had a few too many tools in their belt — as well as new mythic and legendary items, changes to the runes system, new bounties for objectives and towers, and the star of the preview: some wild new dragons.\n\n\nDragons are a powerful map objective. They spawn in the river pit on the bottom side of the map, and can come in one of a few elemental varieties. Each elemental dragon changes the terrain of the map, and offers buffs when killed, making it an important task for teams to prioritize.\nPreseason 2022 is adding two new dragons. The Hextech Dragon offers gates around the map that allow for teleportation. The Chemtech Dragon grants players extra damage when their health is low, and when they die, they get a second shot at killing their enemies with a short-lived ghost form. In addition, the Chemtech Dragon creates camouflage zones around the map to hide teams. Sneaky!\nPreseason 2022 will be available on the game’s test environment in a couple of weeks, and Riot will dial back these new changes if they disrupt the game a little too much. Right now, League of Legends esports teams are competing in the game’s yearly Worlds tournament. Arcane, a television series that explores Hextech and Chemtech in the cities of Zaun and Piltover, will debut on Netflix in November.",

While Platinum is intentionally going for “oil painting style” graphics with Babylon’s Fall, some found the aesthetic to be too muddy and stylized. So Platinum’s changing that.\nOn Wednesday, PlatinumGames and Square Enix showed off the revised graphics for Babylon’s Fall, which, while certainly clearer, still maintain the studio’s “brushwork style” that’s based on classical European oil paintings. You can see the revised graphical style in the slider image below, with the new graphics shown on the right.\n\n\nOn Babylon’s Fall’s official website, the developers revealed the new graphics in an update from the game’s closed beta test. Regarding the graphics, the developers said, “This was an area we received many strong opinions and requests about in Phases 1 and 2 of the Closed Beta Test, particularly regarding poor visibility. Accordingly, we have been working to improve the overall visual clarity, while still keeping the distinctive classic fantasy oil painting aesthetic.”\nSo, yeah, things are far less blurry in the latest version of Babylon’s Fall — which does not have a release date.\nSquare Enix and PlatinumGames announced Babylon’s Fall way back in 2018. After a period of concerning quiet, the game reemerged this summer, with Platinum confirming that the project would be a live-service multiplayer game.

But this year, Epic’s creepy bash will be bigger than ever, with new content regularly throughout October.\nPlayers can get their hands on new and unique pumpkin and trick-or-treat costumes, as well as costumes based on Halloween classics like Frankenstein’s Monster and The Mummy. New costumes will be revealed regularly in the shop. There’s a new Short Nite — a kind of mini-film festival — coming. And Fortnite Creative players will get new content as well. The island itself will include Dual Fiend Hunters and a new crossbow-like weapon.\nLast year, Fortnitemares came with the subtitle, “Midas’ Revenge,” and offered a direct story tie-in, and this year’s event involves the mysterious Cube. Epic still has more information to reveal around this year’s Fortnitemares, and will update its blog with new reveals over the next few weeks.",

It looks like a new kind of ghoul is coming to the game, according to a post on Kinetic Games’ social media.\nThe teaser image shows two new ghost types, although their names and the specifics are blurred out.

Since launch, Kinetic Games has continued to add features to the game that help make it a mainstay on Twitch, with features like new ghosts and levels, or the ability to scare your friends by throwing things at them as a ghost after you’ve died.",

Musical director Nobuo Uematsu is “overseeing” the soundtrack, and Dungeon Encounters features character art from designer Ryoma Ito, whose talents are on display here.\nImage: Square Enix\n  \nWhile it appears we’ll see many of the game’s characters in 2D static artwork form, there is a big fat cat named Sir Cat and a dachshund with a sword in its mouth named Jufren, and I already want to spend time with them.\nBeyond that, Square Enix promises “100 levels of thought-provoking challenges,” so I’m approaching Dungeon Encounters from the angle of “this looks like a good puzzle game, not something with an actual budget” and hoping for the best.\nDungeon Encounters will be available digitally for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Windows PC via Steam on Oct. 14. The game will cost $29.99, but is currently discounted to $23.99 for pre-orders.",

The upcoming Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters takes a different, more tactical approach to things. In Chaos Gate, players take the role of the Space Marine chapter known as the Grey Knights, and take the fight to Chaos in an X-Com style game.\nThe Grey Knights are a mysterious Space Marine chapter; while games like Space Marine focus on the Ultramarines, who take the front lines, the Grey Knights are more about the mystical and faith-based sides of the Imperium. In battling back Chaos Space Marines and a mysterious disease known as the Bloom, the Grey Knights will need to update their base of operations, build new facilities, run research projects, and head into combat missions. \nOnce Grey Knights are in the field, players will need to upgrade them into classes. There are four classes, and players can customize their armor and facial options to create their own special squad. Chaos Space Marines evolve as well, which escalates combat and forces players to focus on strategy.\nThe narrative is written by Black Library author Aaron Dembski-Bowden, so this should have some interesting lore for Warhammer fans.\nWarhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters is currently planned to release on PC in 2022.",

This has led to long queues as players try to log into the game.\nDuring its official launch day of Sept. 28, New World peaked at number two on Steam with a player count of just over 700,000. This massive player count is good news for Amazon, but the game’s servers apparently weren’t up to the task. The game has over 26,000 Steam reviews, and most of them — which Steam labels as Mixed, with just 48% skewing positive at the time of writing — complain about the game’s massive queues and limited server capacity. \nOf course, Amazon Game Studios is more than aware of New World’s problem. In a launch day update post on the game’s website, the developer explained that its short-term goal is setting up new servers and working to expand the capacity of the ones that are already online, in order to help everyone log in and play as soon as possible. \nAmazon Game Studios also has a long-term plan to let players transfer their characters to an entirely new server for free in the next two weeks. This should help balance the load so that certain overpopulated servers aren’t too stressed, while lower-population servers — with lower queue times — should get a boost in players to even things out.\nWhile all of these plans should help reduce the queue times in the future for New World, it’s likely that players will still have to deal with a wait to log in for the next few days, especially on more populated servers. But as Amazon rolls out its solutions, and the hype eventually dies down a bit, players should hopefully be able to get into Aeternum a little more quickly.",

I marveled at the galaxy’s beautiful planets, playing as a Hearthian alien on my first space expedition. The trip would take me away from my home of Timber Hearth and across the cosmos, exploring archaeological ruins, and sussing out the civilization that left them behind. The game was, put simply, stunning.\nBut Outer Wilds was also incredibly difficult. Navigating the ship required controlling six thrusters, and charting a course that would let me land on orbiting celestial bodies.

The beta will run from Oct. 6-9, Electronic Arts and developer DICE announced on Tuesday. \nThe open beta will include Battlefield’s signature Conquest mode, but with a slight twist: Two teams will compete to control several flags in certain areas, rather than larger individual control points. The beta will feature the game’s Orbital map, which takes the fight to an active rocket launch site. During the beta, players can choose to play as one of four different specialists, who each more or less represent a traditional Battlefield class and have their own abilities. \nBattlefield 2042 players who have pre-ordered the game will get access to the beta starting on Oct. 6 for an exclusive two-day early access period. The beta will open up for all players starting on Oct. 8. The beta will be available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. PlayStation Plus is not required to participate in the open beta, but if you plan to play on Xbox, you will need an active Xbox Live Gold subscription.\nDICE and EA also announced the PC system requirements for the beta, which you can find below: \nMinimum PC requirements\nOS: 64-bit Windows 10\nProcessor (AMD): AMD Ryzen 5 3600\nProcessor (Intel): Core i5-6600K\nMemory: 8 GB\nVideo Memory: 4 GB\nGraphics card (NVIDIA): Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti\nGraphics card (AMD): AMD Radeon RX 560\nDirectX: 12\nOnline Connection Requirements: 512 kbps or faster Internet connection\nHard-drive space: 100 GB\nRecommended PC requirements\nOS: 64-bit Windows 10\nProcessor (AMD): AMD Ryzen 7 2700X\nProcessor (Intel): Intel Core i7-4790\nMemory: 16 GB\nVideo Memory: 8 GB\nGraphics card (NVIDIA): Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060\nGraphics card (AMD): AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT\nDirectX: 12\nOnline Connection Requirements: 512 kbps or faster Internet connection\nHard-drive space: 100 GB SSD",

The next content update for Dead by Daylight is Hour of the Witch, and it includes a new Survivor named Mikaela Reid.\nWe didn’t get a look at Mikaela’s exclusive perks, which change the way each Survivor plays. However, Survivors tend to be much squishier and more vulnerable than Killers, and have very little, if anything, in the way of offensive capabilities. It seems that Mikaela may be able to use her witchy ways to help the team in a support capability, as a tweet by developer Behaviour Interactive reads “She brings light and life to a realm of darkness and death.”\nShe brings light and life to a realm of darkness and death.  \nA new Survivor is coming to Dead by Daylight… pic.twitter.com/owFWDDLYrD\n— Dead by Daylight (@DeadByBHVR) September 28, 2021\n\n\n\nIt makes sense to get a new Survivor, as the last addition to the game was Pinhead. The Hellraiser update only contained a Killer. Usually these updates also have a complementary Survivor. While Pinhead is a licensed character, Mikaela appears to be totally original to Dead by Daylight, and she’ll likely have some sort of story that explains how she ended up in the Fog.",

In Toem, developer Something We Made’s game is built around the idea of a photography mode.

Regularly, like the ticking of a clock, huge, new icebergs from the edges of the glacier plunge into the ocean each day with a thunderous boom and a roar. Our planet breathes. The accelerated melting of the ice is nothing more than one of our Earth’s compensatory reactions. Everything is constantly in motion. Even landscapes are changing with breathtaking speed, if time is not measured on a human scale. For me, icebergs are swimming sculptures, witnesses to a global change that, drifting southward on the ocean, slowly dissolve into their mirror image.\n\n\nI’ve included some of my favorite shots from his projects above — beautiful but signifiers of the deep trouble humanity is in.

After creating his version of the automobile in 1896, Ford moved workshops first to Mack Avenue and later to Piquette Avenue in Detroit. These first two factories were small-scale structures for limited car production. Only in 1913 at Ford’s third factory at Highland Park did mass-production begin on a truly large scale. As shown in this film, here Ford applied assembly line methods throughout the factory to all aspects of car production.\n\n\nThere’s also a virtual reality model of the factory you can fly around in.\nTags: cars   Ford   Myles Zhang   video",

They have fallen out of favor over the past decade or two, but Willems argues they serve a needed purpose. For instance, opening title sequences can set the tone or theme of the film before it even gets started — that’s what Saul Bass set out to do:\n\nBass called this “creating a climate for the story”. Here’s one of Willems’ favorite opening sequences by Bass, from 1966’s Grand Prix, which I’d somehow never seen before and is fantastic:\n\nMe? I love opening title sequences. (Except when they are bad and too long.) But I also love when the movie starts right away. And when the movie starts right away and then you get a title card like 8 minutes into it. I’m a fan of anything when it’s done well. *shrugs*\nP.S.

The result was a frank portrait of death, which offered non-medical folks a view of something they rarely get to witness.\nMany of the posts deal matter-of-factly with Brandt’s experience of inhabiting a dying body. Did she still crave sex? (“It’s like, for me, at least, there’s nothing there,” she tells Acquaviva, on camera.) Did she remember that she had a diaper on, and that it was time to relieve herself? What were her symptoms today, and how were they different from yesterday’s? The couple’s radical openness extended to a post, the day before Brandt’s death, in which Acquaviva says, “I’m sharing this for nonmedical people who’ve never heard the beginnings of a death rattle. The death rattle is Kathy Brandt’s. … The video is dark and jumpy, but the sound is decent.” The next day, Acquaviva posted a picture of her wife’s face, taken shortly after her death.\n\n\nNote: this video can be difficult at times (because you’re watching someone dying), but as Acquaviva says, “In a culture were we don’t share almost anything around illness and death, the only way to counter that is for some people to share a little bit more than is probably appropriate.”\nTags: death   Kathy Brandt   Kim Acquaviva   video",

The electricity is utilized in the home or business, can be stored in a wall-mounted battery, or can even be fed back into the national grid to provide revenue for the owner.\n\n\nHere’s the wall in action:\n\nFrom a writeup of the project in Fast Company:\nDoucet has built a prototype for a single spinning rod and run simulations based on that. The average annual electricity consumption for an American home uses a little over 10,000 kilowatt-hours per year. One of these walls would be enough. But where Doucet sees true potential is in larger-scale commercial buildings and even cities. “Instead of the typical retaining walls along roads and freeways, you’d have an array of these,” says Doucet, who says he’s in conversation with several manufacturers to help him bring the product to market. “With the added wind boost from trucks, our highways could take care of all our energy needs.”\n\n\n(thx, michael)\nTags: art   energy   Joe Doucet   video",

Randomly chosen by the code, the trajectory and point it hits the canvas is variable creating another factor of uniqueness.  This is all controlled by a servo under the base of the catapult, which also happens to be the motor that allows Flingbot to position itself under the paint reservoirs.\n\n\nThis means that every painting Flingbot creates is effectively unique.\nAll in all, accounting for all the different parameters, there are almost 3 trillion paintings that Flingbot can make. The number is likely even higher than this because there are even more variables to consider that are out of Flingbots control.  These include the consistency of the paint, the angle of the canvas, the temperature in the room…the list goes on.  It’s safe to say that each one of Flingbot’s painting is truly one of a kind.\n\n\n(via the morning news)\nTags: art   robots   video",

Thompson decided to exploit this printing feature, enlisting a boatload of artists to design a completely new version of The Every cover.\n\n\nThe hardcover version of the book featuring the 32+ designs will only be available on the McSweeney’s website and in independent bookstores, which doesn’t seem to include Bookshop.org. Amazon, says Eggers, can go pound sand.\n“I don’t like bullies,” Eggers wrote in an email. “Amazon has been kicking sand in the face of independent bookstores for decades now.”\nThe novel follows a former forest ranger and tech skeptic, Delaney Wells, as she tries to take down a dangerous monopoly from the inside: a company called The Every, formed when the world’s most powerful e-commerce site merged with the biggest social media company/search engine.\n“One of the themes of the book is the power of monopolies to dictate our choices, so it seemed a good opportunity to push back a bit against the monopoly, Amazon, that currently rules the book world,” he said. “So we started looking into how feasible it would be to make the hardcover available only through independent bookstores.

          "description": "Using samples of chopped-down wood left behind by Viking explorers at their settlement in Newfoundland and known chemical markers of powerful solar storms in 993 AD, a group of scientists has determined the exact timing of the first-known visit of Europeans to North America: 1021 AD. If you’re keeping score at home, that’s 471 years before Columbus.\nA team of scientists looked at wood found at the L’Anse aux Meadows Viking site. In three cases the trees had been physically cut down, and moreover, they were clearly cut with metal tools — Vikings had metal implements at the time, but indigenous people did not. The wood was all from different trees (one was fir, and another juniper, for example). The key parts here are that the wood was all from trees that had been alive for many decades, and all had their waney edge intact as well.\nThe scientists extracted 127 samples from the wood, and 83 rings were examined. They used two methods to secure dates. The first was to compare the amount of carbon-14 in each ring with known atmospheric amounts from the time. This gives a rough date for the waney edge of the wood. They also then looked for an anomalous spike in carbon-14 in an inner ring, knowing this would have come from the 993 A.D. event, and then simply counted the rings outward from there to get the date of the waney edge.\nIn all three samples the waney edge was dated to the same year: 1021 A.D. This would be incredibly unlikely to occur at random.\n\n\nOutstanding science. It’s incredible how much of a time machine these analysis tools are. There’s so much we don’t know about people who lived 1000 years ago, but it’s astounding that we know anything at all, particularly precise dates like this.\nTags: science   Vikings",

          "description": "Oh, I’m excited for this one. I’m not saying The Great was the best show I’ve seen over the past couple of years, but it’s definitely one of the most fun and enjoyable. A synopsis:\nThe Great is a satirical, comedic drama about the rise of Catherine the Great from outsider to the longest reigning female ruler in Russia’s history. A fictionalized, fun and anachronistic story of an idealistic, romantic young girl, who arrives in Russia for an arranged marriage to the mercurial Emperor Peter. Hoping for love and sunshine, she finds instead a dangerous, depraved, backward world that she resolves to change. All she has to do is kill her husband, beat the church, baffle the military and get the court onside.\n\n\nThe Great was created by Tony McNamara, who co-wrote The Favourite — both have the same punchy, ribald dialogue. You can catch up on season one on Hulu while we wait for the season two premiere on Nov 19.\nTags: The Great   Tony McNamara   trailers   TV   video",

Key art graphics are the images that identify shows in streaming menus — ok here, it’s just easier to show you:\n\n\n\nLike the best movie posters and book covers, these images are bold and simple promotional signifiers of a larger piece of media, but as Rex Sorgatz argues in today’s edition of Why is this interesting?, key art is its own thing with its own set of constraints and challenges.\nGood key art is so evocative, so iconic, that it becomes the image that springs to mind whenever you think about a show:\nOne neglected characteristic ties all these images together: They are all horizontal.\nIt sounds trivial, but going wide helped differentiate TV key art as its own medium, distinct from book covers and movie posters. And because these images appear on streaming platforms, they are unencumbered by other marketing copy, like taglines, cast and credits, and multifarious blurbs.\nThere is a simple purity to key art.\n\n\nSorgatz maintains an archive of his favorite key art here.\nTags: design   Rex Sorgatz   TV",

It’s also been recording audio of its environment with a pair of microphones and in this video, a pair of NASA scientists share some of those recordings and what we might learn about Mars from them.\nThis is one of my absolute favorite sounds. This is the sound of a helicopter flying on Mars. We used this sound to actually understand the propagation of sound in general through the Martian atmosphere, and it turns out that we were totally wrong with our models. The Martian atmosphere can propagate sound a lot further than we thought it could.\n\n\nAnd surprisingly for me, that’s my friend Nina in the video! (We eclipse-chased together in 2017.)

The collection is called A People’s Archive of Sinking and Melting.\nA People’s Archive of Sinking and Melting is a collection of materials contributed by people living in places that may disappear because of the combined physical, political, and economic impacts of climate change, primarily sea level rise, erosion, desertification, and glacial melting.\n\n\nFrom a piece about the archive in the New Yorker:\nThere is an incredible pathos to Balkin’s collection of things. In the light of imagined future eyes, tinged by loss, all manner of things become relevant that would otherwise pass unnoticed. Even two beer-bottle caps, in this context, are mesmerizing. Both are from places that are threatened with a certain kind of disappearance, or, at the very least, radical change; through their corrosion and fading, they seemed to foretell this disappearance somehow. And yet, paradoxically, looking at them, I knew that these pieces of metal would likely outlast me. A future person might see them in a museum, displayed with a label that reads “Beer-bottle caps, common in this time.” But what would that person’s world be like? What would be lost, between now and then, even as these fragments are shored up against ruin?\n\n\nYou can contribute to the archive — instructions for sending in an artifact are here.\nTags: Amy Balkin   art   global warming",

It outlined a plan for overturning the election by claiming that seven states actually had competing state slates of electors, which while not even remotely true, would have given Mike Pence the excuse to throw out those states and thus hand the election to Trump.\nBut of course the plan required election officials in those states to go along. Trump thought the ones who were Republican would. Most did not. And that’s what he’s been working on fixing ever since.\n\n\n\nYou might have strong feelings about Bill Maher. Ok, fine.

Now, a graphic edition of On Tyranny has been released, designed and illustrated by Nora Krug. From Steven Heller’s piece on the book in Print:\nKrug’s goal for this project was to use her medium to echo Snyder’s call for action. “While it was important to me to create images that would highlight the contemporary relevance of Snyder’s message,” she writes, “the use of historic images was clearly essential. At moments in the book that refer to a particular event in time — such as this one about Hitler’s annexation of Austria, when Austrian Nazis captured Jews and forced them to scrub the streets clean — I felt that rather than showing my own visual representation of that event, it was more powerful to feature a historic photograph because of the immediacy of the medium that would make that moment in history come to life.”\nCombining Krug’s drawings with historic materials gave her the license to contrast the documentary with the imagined, the factual with the poetic, and to create a narrative tension that emphasizes historical relationships. “More importantly,” she explains, “this combination of mediums allows me to admit to the fact that we don’t exist in a vacuum, that we can only exist in relationship to the past, that everything we think and feel is thought and felt in reference to it, that our future is deeply rooted in our history, and that we will always be active contributors to shaping how the past is viewed and what our future will look like.”\n\n\nYou can order the graphic version of On Tyranny here but it seems to be backordered in most places.\nTags: books   Nora Krug   On Tyranny   politics   Steven Heller   Timothy Snyder   USA",

What you are seeing, like all the rest of the clips in this video, was filmed at 6,000 frames per second.\n\n\nMost of the moths in the video are delightfully fuzzy and chonky — if these moths were birds, they’d be birbs. Shall we call them mopfs?\nThe rest of Smith’s AntLab videos are worth looking through — I’ve previously posted about his slow motion videos here.

          "description": "The three-point shot has become the focus of the offensive strategy of every successful NBA team. But is it also making the game boring?\nThe math states that scoring one-third of your shots from behind the 3-point line is as good as scoring half your shots from inside the line. In other words: Shooting as many 3s as possible will likely lead to a higher score.\nThe league took notice, and teams and players followed suit. 3s have become so prevalent in recent years that fans are criticizing the league for being oversaturated with them. Critics worry that the game is on the verge of becoming boring because everyone is trying to do the same thing. And that’s led some to wonder if the NBA should move the 3-point line back.\n\n\nCheck out the “additional reading” in the YouTube description, like The NBA is at a breaking point with three-point shooting and Is It Time to Move the NBA 3-Point Line Back?

From A COVID Serenity Prayer in The Atlantic:\nFor the past 18 months, my patients have craved straightforward answers: a simple “Yes-it’s perfectly safe” or “Go for it. Have fun!” or even a “No, you absolutely cannot” to quiet the endless loops of risk calculations. But medicine is not about certainty. It never has been.\nThe two things that patients want-reassurance that they won’t get COVID-19 and permission to engage in life-I cannot deliver, and I never will be able to. SARS-CoV-2 is here to stay. The virus will be woven into our everyday existence much like RSV, influenza, and other common coronaviruses are. The question isn’t whether we’ll be exposed to the novel coronavirus; it’s when.\nAnd although many of us will inevitably get COVID-19, for the majority of vaccinated people, it won’t be so bad. The vaccines weren’t designed to wholly prevent COVID-19; they transformed it into a manageable illness like the flu.\nThat means that, from a decision-making perspective, we’re starting to reach the acceptance phase of the pandemic: a time when we must recalibrate our individual risk gauges, which have been completely thrown out of whack. The approach I’m embracing with patients boils down to a secular version of the serenity prayer. We need “the serenity to accept the things [we] cannot change, courage to change the things [we] can, and the wisdom to know the difference.”\n\n\n Tags: Covid-19   Lucy McBride   medicine",

The team mascot? An astronaut. It’s a radical move, but the club is bringing in supporters from afar. “It’s really amazing to be part of this amazing movement,” says Flat Earth player Mario Cardete. “I think it’s more than a club.”\n\n\nDuring the pandemic, the club also became anti-mask and anti-vax — because conspiracy theories come in price-saving 3-packs, I guess? Poves resigned in late 2020 and the club was renamed and then purchased by a larger club to become their reserve team. The Earth remains round.\nTags: science   soccer   sports   video",

Crowe, as part of his duties at the zoo, has embraced his role as Walnut’s mate in order to inseminate her with semen from a male crane.\nThat summer, however, Crowe noticed that Walnut seemed interested in, well, him. When Crowe stopped by her yard, she would bow her head and raise her wings — motions that Crowe now recognizes as the first moves of a mating dance. “At first, I thought that she was just excited to see me,” Crowe says. “But then I’d see the other pairs doing the same things…",

          "description": "A pair of 1300-year-old skis has been discovered in an ice field in Norway. They are believed to be the best-preserved ancient skis ever found — even the bindings are mostly intact. The first of the pair was found back in 2014 and its mate was recently retrieved, an expedition you can witness in the video above.\nIt has been seven years since the discovery of the first ski at the Digervarden ice patch. We have patiently monitored the melt of the ice patch, in case the second ski of the pair should melt out. We were back in 2016 for a general survey of the ice patch, but the ice had not retreated much then. This year, we could see on satellite imagery that the ice patch had retreated compared to 2014. We decided to send out an archaeologist to check it.\n\n\nOne of the things they were hoping to find is how the skier was able to maintain forward motion with the skis, especially uphill. Modern cross-country skis rely on a texture (or wax) on the bottom of the ski to grip the snow while downhill skiers can apply skins to their skis to climb uphill. More than a thousand years ago, the choice was texture or animal fur:\nOne of the questions raised by the ski found in 2014 was if it originally had fur on the underside. This has major implications for the use of the ski. There were no nail holes along the sides of the 2014 ski which would have been a clear sign of the fastening of the fur. However, fur can also be glued to the underside, so we could not rule it out.\nA furrow on the underside along the length of the ski, as you find on other prehistoric skis (and on modern cross-country skis), would solve the question. Such a furrow would have no function with an underside covered by fur. The 2014 ski did not show a furrow, but the new and better preserved ski does! So, probably no fur-lining.\n\n\n(thx, meg)\nTags: archaeology   skiing   video",

          "description": "Even for mathematically minded folks, statistics can be hard to grasp. Take statistical paradoxes for example: Simpson’s Paradox is a real mind-boggler. Ryan Anderson explains this paradox in a recent issue of Why is this interesting?\nIt’s simple to describe, yet it still stops me in my tracks when I see it in the wild. The paradox is that a measurable effect on a large population disappears, or even reverses when that population is split into subgroups. The cause of these results is almost always a material change in the denominators from one period to the next.\nShowing is easier than telling with paradoxes, so here is a classic example: In 1995 and 1996, David Justice had a higher batting average than Derek Jeter in each year. However, Jeter had a higher cumulative batting average over those two years.\n\n\nIt’s true; look:\n\nAnderson continues:\nHow does this work? Jeter’s 1996 stats accounted for over 92% of his total performance over the two years, as he was 20 years old and only called up to the major league for a few games in 1995. Meanwhile, Justice’s 1996 stats were only 25% of his total performance due to a separated shoulder he suffered barely two months into the season. So while Justice performed better on smaller sample size, Jeter’s 183 hits in 1996 were the strongest signal for overall performance.\n\n\nRead the rest of the piece; he goes on to connect statistical paradoxes to efforts to mislead people about the pandemic and vaccine effectiveness.\nTags: baseball   mathematics   Ryan Anderson   sports",

This looks so much like small fires exploding into raging infernos and then dying down before flaring up all over again. Indeed, forest fire metaphors seem to be particularly useful in describing pandemics like this.\nThink of COVID-19 as a fire burning in a forest. All of us are trees. The R0 is the wind speed. The higher it is, the faster the fire tears through the forest. But just like a forest fire, COVID-19 needs fuel to keep going. We’re the fuel.\nIn other forest fire metaphorical scenarios, people are ‘kindling’, ‘sparks being thrown off’ (when infecting others) and ‘fuel’ (when becoming infected). In these cases, fire metaphors convey the dangers posed by people being in close proximity to one another, but without directly attributing blame: people are described as inanimate entities (trees, kindling, fuel) that are consumed by the fire they contribute to spread.\n\n\nSee also A Time Lapse World Map of Every Covid-19 Death (from July 2020).\nTags: Covid-19   death   infoviz   maps   time lapse   video",

They question why, for example, it differs from two contemporary copies made from Rubens’s original. The toes of Samson’s outstretched right foot, for example, are cropped in the National Gallery version, while they are shown in an engraving by Jacob Matham and a painting that depicts the Samson and Delilah hanging in Rockox’s home by Frans Francken the Younger.\n\n\n Tags: art   Peter Paul Rubens   video",

What we know about gravity suggests it would pull toward the center of the disk. That means it would only pull straight down at one point on the center of the disk. As you got increasingly far from the center, gravity would tug more and more horizontally. This would have some strange impacts, like sucking all the water toward the center of the wor…",

This video documents how they do it.\nThe Nenet reindeer herders need to move their tent every few days throughout most of the year. Every time they migrate they must pack the whole tent away, drag it across the tundra on sledges, and erect it again in a fresh place, sometimes in temperatures of minus thirty degrees. Survival depends on working together as a team.\nAfter staying in the wooded taiga for two months they start to migrate north following the ancient paths of migrating reindeer (caribou). In four months they will travel up to 1200km and must pack and move every three to five days to keep up with their herd. They must reach their summer quarters before the snows melt and flood great rivers with icy waters too cold and deep for the calves, born along the way, to cross.\n\n\nSee also How to Build an Igloo.

The US is throwing too little money at high-tech, ultimately private sector solutions but much of the problem comes down to our underfunded public health system and “profoundly unequal society”.\n“To be ready for the next pandemic, we need to make sure that there’s an even footing in our societal structures,” Seema Mohapatra, a health-law expert at Indiana University, told me. That vision of preparedness is closer to what 19th-century thinkers lobbied for, and what the 20th century swept aside. It means shifting the spotlight away from pathogens themselves and onto the living and working conditions that allow pathogens to flourish. It means measuring preparedness not just in terms of syringes, sequencers, and supply chains but also in terms of paid sick leave, safe public housing, eviction moratoriums, decarceration, food assistance, and universal health care. It means accompanying mandates for social distancing and the like with financial assistance for those who might lose work, or free accommodation where exposed people can quarantine from their family. It means rebuilding the health policies that Reagan began shredding in the 1980s and that later administrations further frayed. It means restoring trust in government and community through public services. “It’s very hard to achieve effective containment when the people you’re working with don’t think you care about them,” Arrianna Marie Planey, a medical geographer at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, told me.\n\n\n Tags: Covid-19   Ed Yong   healthcare   politics   science   USA",

          "description": "This coming Monday, Apple is having an event they are referring to as \"Unleashed\". The general rumor is this will be an announcement of new MacBook Pros with faster M1 based processors.\nThat'd be great, but what I really want is some sort of M1/M1X/M2 based iMac Pro with a big display. It's been a while since I've bought a new desktop (I'm still rocking a late 2015 iMac for some reason), and I'm eager for something newer and faster. Hopefully we'll also get a release day for MacOS Monterey.\nOne thing that I haven't seen remarked upon much, is that it's been few weeks since a new beta of Xcode 13 dropped with a Monterey SDK to build against. This makes me think that there will be new APIs for dealing with some sort of new hardware in whatever is coming out Monday. So whatever we're getting, I bet it's going to be a little more involed than just a standard hardware upgrade.",

I’m feeling my way to that destination, which is years off, surely, and I just hope to manage it gracefully. (I don’t know of any role models with this.)\nAnyway.

Winger Nicolas Aube-Kubel has been fined $2,687.50 by the NHL’s Department of Player Safety for kneeing Panthers forward Mason Marchment.\nPhiladelphia’s Nicolas Aube-Kubel has been fined $2,687.50, the maximum allowable under the CBA, for Kneeing Florida’s Mason Marchment.\n— NHL Player Safety (@NHLPlayerSafety) October 24, 2021\n\n\n\nThe money goes to the Players’ Emergency Assistance Fund.\nThe incident, which occurred just a few minutes into the third period resulted in the Flyers player getting a two-minute minor for tripping as well. Luckily, Florida did not take advantage of that man advantage — but they did score a shorthanded game-winning goal just minutes later.\nHere's another look. Aube-Kubel given two minutes for tripping pic.twitter.com/0EYhZ7Yurz\n— NHL Review (@nhl_review) October 24, 2021\n\n\n\nBy looking at some clips of the kneeing, it’s a pretty dreadful way to take the dude off of the puck. Aube-Kubel certainly left his leg in Marchment’s path, committing to the collision that could have resulted in a serious injury.\nAfter a disappointing season, the Flyers fourth-line winger has not gotten much better. Pointless through four games, Aube-Kubel has not been on the ice for a Philadelphia goal, but four from the opposition in just over 39 minutes of action. — add the context that the Flyers have been getting kicked in the gut by just about every on-ice metric when he’s out there; it’s dreadful.\nFlyers are back on the ice on Wednesday as they make their western road trip, facing the Edmonton Oilers first.",

This is a very fresh release with iconic Agathocles and new blood from Singapore – Heraclides. The tape is damn short but interesting and cheerful. Belgian mince veterans start this split with damn raw song. Guys used only two songs for this work… and I don`t really know what to say about it, because I`ve talked about this band so many times, haha. So the sound is freaking raw, the first track “Piss On Flemish Myths ” is aggressive and nice, nothing outstanding, …",

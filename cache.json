From there, toggle on Lossless Audio and Dolby Atmos. Note that these options appear in the iOS 15.1 beta, but the ‌HomePod‌ 15.1 beta seems to be needed to actually use the features on the ‌HomePod‌.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf all goes well, these features should launch with the ‌HomePod‌ 15.1 software that is set to be released alongside iOS 15.1. Since the iOS 15.1 was just provided to developers today, we likely have several weeks of testing to go.\nRelated Roundups: HomePod, HomePod mini\nBuyer's Guide: HomePod (Don't Buy), HomePod Mini (Buy Now)\nRelated Forum: HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home & Auto Technology\nThis article, \"HomePod 15.1 Beta Adds Lossless Audio and Dolby Atmos Support\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The new updates reintroduce features like SharePlay, and below, we have a list of what's new.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSharePlay\n\r\n\r\nSharePlay is enabled in the iOS 15.1, iPadOS 15.1, and tvOS 15.1 betas to allow Apple to further work out bugs to get the feature ready to launch. Apple decided to pull SharePlay from the ‌iOS 15‌ launch because it was not properly functioning and was still riddled with issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAvailable in FaceTime, SharePlay is designed to let users call up their friends and family and then watch TV, watch movies, and listen to music together using neat features like shared playlists and TV show syncing for all users. SharePlay also allows for screen sharing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf testing goes well, SharePlay could see an official launch in iOS 15.1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnounce Calls\n\r\n\r\nIn the Settings for the Phone app, there's a new icon for the \"Announce Calls\" setting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLossless Audio for HomePod\n\r\n\r\nThe HomePod 15.1 beta that accompanies the iOS 15.1 beta adds Lossless Audio and Dolby Atmos with Spatial Audio support to the HomePod and HomePod mini.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVaccine Cards in Wallet\n\r\n\r\nIn ‌iOS 15‌, verifiable health records can be downloaded and stored in the Health app, and this includes COVID-19 vaccination records and health results. In iOS 15.1, vaccination records are able to be added to the Wallet app so a vaccine card can be provided to businesses, restaurants, venues, and more where vaccines are required for entry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSee our previous article for more details and discussion. Discussion should be limited to the ‌iOS 15‌ update and political comments will be immediately removed. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Features\n\r\n\r\nKnow of a feature that we left out? Let us know in the comments.\nRelated Roundups: iOS 15, iPadOS 15\nRelated Forum: iOS 15\nThis article, \"Everything New in iOS 15.1 Beta 1\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "The iOS 15.1 beta that was introduced today allows iPhone users to upload their COVID-19 vaccination status to the Health app and then generate a vaccination card in Apple Wallet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Apple Wallet vaccination card can be shown to businesses, venues, restaurants, and more that are requiring vaccines for entry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs outlined in an announcement to developers, verifiable health records are based on the SMART Health Cards specification. California is using SMART Health Cards, so users in California can add their vaccination records to the Wallet app after installing iOS 15.1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther states and health organizations that use the SMART Health Cards will be able to use a button to let users know that they can download and store their vaccination information in the Health app and in the Wallet app. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCalifornia, Louisiana, New York, Virginia, Hawaii, and some Maryland counties support Smart Health Cards, as do Walmart, Sam's Club, and CVS Health. So those in the specific supported states should be able to look up their information in state databases, but those who were vaccinated through companies like Walmart and CVS will also be able to add their information to the Health and Wallet apps because it's the same system. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that some apps like the one used by the NHS in the UK allowed users to add their vaccination records to the Wallet app, but the new solution is a universal standard that will work for all healthcare providers/states that implement it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscussion should be limited to the app and implementation, and not politics.\nRelated Roundups: iOS 15, iPadOS 15\nTag: COVID-19 Coronavirus\nRelated Forum: iOS 15\nThis article, \"iOS 15.1 Beta Lets Users Add COVID Vaccination Card to Wallet App\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

It is a cleaner and more streamlined look than the prior ‌iCloud‌ Mail app for the web, but the functionality is largely the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nColors are lighter, the font has been updated, and there's a new smaller compose window for writing emails that takes up less space.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple introduced the new ‌iCloud‌ Mail design for the web during the ‌iOS 15‌ beta testing process and it was previously limited to the beta.icloud.com site, but it has now been released for the main iCloud.com website.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple today also made the Hide My Email and Custom Email Domain features live on the main iCloud.com site. Hide My Email is designed to allow users to create throwaway emails that forward to a main email address. With this feature, users can create different email addresses for different websites and then disable them if spam emails ever start arriving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCustom Email Domains are designed to allow customers to use their own custom email addresses with the ‌iCloud‌ Mail feature. Domain records need to be updated with Apple's settings, so access to the domain's registrar is required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll of these new features can be accessed by logging into the iCloud.com website.

In a research note seen by MacRumors, Kuo shared some of his key hardware expectations for next year's tentatively named iPhone 14 Pro models, including a hole-punch display and a 48-megapixel Wide lens for the rear camera system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA hole-punch design refers to a display with only a small circular cutout for the front camera, as seen on many recent Samsung smartphones. This design would result in the notch being removed, with Face ID sensors likely moved under the display. Kuo said Apple is also working on iPhones with under-screen Touch ID for release in 2023.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for the rear camera, the 48-megapixel Wide lens would be an upgrade from the 12-megapixel Wide lens on iPhone 13 Pro models.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple is expected to release the iPhone 14 lineup in the second half of 2022, in line with usual launch timing. Kuo also reiterated that Apple plans to release a third-generation iPhone SE with 5G support in the first half of 2022. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn line with research shared by Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty this morning, Kuo said pre-orders for the iPhone 13 series have been higher than iPhone 12 series, particularly for the higher-end Pro models.\nRelated Roundup: iPhone 14\nTags: Ming-Chi Kuo, TF International Securities\nThis article, \"Kuo: iPhone 14 Pro Models to Feature Hole-Punch Display and 48MP Wide Camera\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "While it has been many years since Apple stopped providing first weekend sales numbers for new iPhones, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty today said that iPhone 13 Pro pre-orders are \"off to a promising start\" with \"strong early demand.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHuberty based her opinion off of Apple's delivery estimates for iPhones, which she has been tracking for many years. Shortly after pre-orders began last Friday, delivery estimates for the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max began slipping into October, with Huberty having calculated the average lead time at around 27 days. She said this is the second longest lead time on the first day of pre-orders amongst all iPhone models launched over the past five years, surpassed only by the iPhone X in 2017.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs of last Friday, Huberty said the iPhone 13 mini was faring better with a lead time of 3.1 days, while the standard iPhone 13 faced no delays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs with every iPhone launch, it is possible that lengthy delivery estimates are a function of low supply rather than high demand, but Huberty said Morgan Stanley's supply chain checks indicate minimal near-term component headwinds for iPhones and concluded that these long lead times \"are at least partly a function of strong early demand.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll four iPhone 13 models will begin arriving to customers and launch in stores on Friday, September 24. Key features across the iPhone 13 lineup include a faster A15 Bionic chip, camera improvements, longer battery life, and a smaller notch. The two Pro models also feature a ProMotion display with a variable refresh rate up to 120Hz.\nRelated Roundups: iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro\nTags: Katy Huberty, Morgan Stanley\nBuyer's Guide: iPhone 13 (Buy Now), iPhone 13 Pro (Buy Now)\nRelated Forum: iPhone\nThis article, \"iPhone 13 Pro Pre-Orders Off to Promising Start With Strong Early Demand, Says Analyst\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Starting next month, Apple is ramping up COVID-19 testing requirements for employees. According to The Verge's Zoe Schiffer, unvaccinated employees will be required to get frequent COVID-19 tests, while vaccinated employees will receive infrequent tests if going into an office or store.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnlike other tech companies, such as Google and Facebook, Apple has not mandated vaccines for its employees and still does not require workers to get vaccinated to remain at Apple. Prior to the upcoming testing mandate, testing was encouraged, but not required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple earlier this month began asking employees to provide details on their vaccination status, and it has been pushing vaccines through an internal vaccination campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple offers vouchers to get employees vaccinated through Walgreens along with on-site vaccinations in the San Francisco Bay Area and Austin. Paid time off is available for vaccine appointments, as is paid sick leave for those who experience side effects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMany corporate employees are still working from home at this point and will not be returning to the office until January at the earliest, but Apple also has a large retail workforce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe details on Apple's testing plans came from today's company-wide town hall meeting, where Cook also spoke on plans for a hybrid work model going forward. \"We learned as a company what it means for everyone to come in everyday because we did that before,\" he said. \"We know what it's like when hardly anyone comes in. We don't really know about the middle range. We need to learn.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCook said that Apple is committed to learning and tweaking its plans going forward, and he said that Apple plans to give everyone an extra three days off next quarter. In the U.S., employees will receive this time off on Thanksgiving week.\nTag: Apple Store\nThis article, \"Apple to Require COVID Testing for Employees Starting Next Month, Still No Vaccine Mandate\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Apple is planning to use an LTPS OLED display for at least one of the four models planned for the iPhone 14 series next year, according to Korean website The Elec, meaning that at least one iPhone 14 model would still have a 60Hz display. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe report lines up with information previously shared by display industry consultant Ross Young, who accurately claimed that the new iPad mini would feature an 8.3-inch display.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max unveiled this week feature ProMotion displays with a variable refresh rate between 10Hz and 120Hz, resulting in smoother appearing content when watching video, gaming, or scrolling text. The devices are able to offer this feature because they are equipped with lower-power LTPO OLED displays, whereas the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini have LTPS OLED displays without support for ProMotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lack of ProMotion on at least one iPhone 14 model wouldn't be too surprising, as Apple may keep the feature limited to the Pro models next year to maintain differentiation with the standard iPhone 14 models. Rumors suggest Apple plans to launch four iPhone 14 models next year, including a 6.1-inch iPhone 14, 6.7-inch iPhone 14 Max, 6.1-inch iPhone 14 Pro, and 6.7-inch iPhone 14 Pro Max, with no iPhone 14 mini.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe report adds that LG Display is aiming to start supplying Apple with LTPO OLED displays in 2022, which would give Apple another supplier of ProMotion displays for iPhones beyond Samsung, which is currently its exclusive supplier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the past, The Elec accurately reported that Apple would launch a new iPad Pro with a LiDAR Scanner in March 2020.\nRelated Roundup: iPhone 14\nTags: ProMotion, The Elec\nThis article, \"At Least One iPhone 14 Model Will Reportedly Still Lack 120Hz ProMotion Display\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Apple has made much of its iPhone 13 battery life improvements, noting for example that the 13 Pro Max offers the longest battery life ever in an iPhone. However, when you look at Apple's own battery comparisons versus the iPhone 12 lineup, it's the streaming video performance that the company has eked out of its new smartphones that really stands out. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\niPhone 12 mini: 10 hours\n\r\n\r\niPhone 12: 11 hours\n\r\n\r\niPhone 12 Pro: 11 hours\n\r\n\r\niPhone 12 Pro Max: 12 hours\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\niPhone 13 Mini: 13 hours\n\r\n\r\niPhone 13: 19 hours\n\r\n\r\niPhone 13 Pro: 20 hours\n\r\n\r\niPhone 13 Pro Max: 25 hours\n \n\nThe iPhone 13 lineup features new low-power displays, a more efficient A15 chip, larger batteries, and more power-efficient components, all of which make for dramatic improvements when streaming, as the numbers above show. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, Apple claims that when streaming video, the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max last nine hours and 13 hours longer than last year's equivalent models, respectively. Taking the same metric, the battery in the iPhone 13 mini manages 13 hours, which is longer than even the iPhone 12 Pro Max. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith video streaming services so ubiquitous these days, not to mention Apple TV+ (and obliquely, Fitness+), Apple has clearly factored the computations involved into the power optimizations that it has achieved through the tight integration of its hardware and software. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, battery life varies by use case and many other factors, so actual results will vary, but if they're anything near what Apple is claiming, binge-watching your favorite show should be a cinch on these latest devices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(H/T to Jack for pointing this out!)\nRelated Roundups: iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro\nBuyer's Guide: iPhone 13 (Buy Now), iPhone 13 Pro (Buy Now)\nRelated Forum: iPhone\nThis article, \"iPhone 13 Batteries Positively Excel at Video Streaming Compared to iPhone 12\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

In early Geekbench 5 results, the new iPad mini has average single-core and multi-core scores of around 1,595 and 4,540, compared to averages of around 1,730 and 4,660 for the iPhone 13 Pro.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMacRumors ran the benchmarks by Geekbench founder John Poole, who said the results appear to be legitimate, including the 2.9GHz clock speed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's unclear why Apple has downclocked the A15 chip in the iPad mini, but most users are unlikely to encounter any issues with performance using the device. Even with a downclocked A15 chip, the new iPad mini is up to 40% faster in single-core performance and up to 70% faster in multi-core performance compared to the previous-generation iPad mini with an A12 chip, according to benchmarks.

Pricing for the 64GB and 128GB ‌iPhone SE‌ options remains the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple is planning an update to the ‌iPhone SE‌ for the first half of 2022. The current model was launched in April 2020, so the removal of the 256GB variant could be a sign that Apple is beginning to ramp down production of this particular model.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring its virtual event, Apple announced that the iPhone 13 and ‌iPhone 13‌ mini start with 128GB of storage, which is double the base 64GB offered for the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe storage capacities available for the ‌iPhone 13‌ and ‌iPhone 13‌ mini include 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB, while the iPhone 13 Pro and ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ Max also have a new 1TB storage option. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPricing continues to start at $699 for the ‌iPhone 13‌ mini, $799 for the ‌iPhone 13‌, $999 for the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌, and $1,099 for the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ Max.

TIME shares an annual list highlighting world leaders, celebrities, tech company executives, authors, musicians, athletes, and more, and this is not the first time Cook has been celebrated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis year's list is broken up into categories that include Icons, Pioneers, Titans, Artists, Leaders, and Innovators. Cook is listed in the \"Titans\" category alongside Shonda Rhimes, Tom Brady, Timbaland and Swizz Beats, Simone Biles, and others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCook's profile was written by Nike co-founder Phil Knight, who reflected on his relationship with Cook and his talks with Cook as a Nike board member. According to Knight, Cook is a man of \"wisdom\" and \"excellent judgment.\"\nOne of his most difficult challenges was the change of leadership at Apple after Steve Jobs passed away, the Steve Jobs who was beloved and recognized around the world as a genius.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis almost impossible transition was handled with amazing dignity and grace, and announced to the world in his own quiet way: \"I am not the second Steve Jobs. I am the first Tim Cook.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd by the way, in the 10 years since... Apple stock has gone up 1,000%, making it the most valuable company in the world.\nOther notable names who made this year's list include Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, Naomi Osaka, Billie Eilish, \"Ted Lasso\" star Jason Sudeikis, Joe Biden, and Elon Musk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEarlier this year, Apple was listed as one of TIME's 100 Most Influential Companies of 2021 thanks to its record breaking holiday quarter and ever increasing product lineup.\nTag: Tim Cook\nThis article, \"Apple CEO Tim Cook Makes TIME's List of 100 Most Influential People of 2021\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Yesterday during Apple's virtual \"California streaming\" event, Apple debuted a refreshed ninth-generation entry-level iPad ($329) and a redesigned sixth-generation iPad mini ($499). Like the iPad Pro, both devices include a 12-megapixel Ultra Wide front camera enabling Center Stage, which makes the iPad Air ($579) the only tablet in Apple's lineup that lacks this feature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCenter Stage is a feature that automatically keeps users perfectly framed during video calls, and it does this by using the much larger field of view of the Ultra Wide front camera. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs users move around, Center Stage automatically pans to keep them in the shot. When other people join in on the call, the camera detects them too, and smoothly zooms out to fit everyone into the view and make sure they are part of the conversation. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple debuted the feature in April with the latest ‌iPad Pro‌. At the time, it was thought the machine learning capabilities of Apple's M1 chip were required to power the feature, but given that the new iPad and iPad mini use A13 and A15 Bionic chips, respectively, that's patently not the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe current ‌iPad Air‌, which debuted in September 2020, has an A14 Bionic processor, but only a f/2.0, 7-megapixel front-facing FaceTime HD Camera for selfies and video calls, making it incompatible with Center Stage. The ‌iPad Air‌ is in its mid-product cycle, however, so it's likely to get the 12-megapixel Ultra Wide front camera in a refresh, perhaps early next year.\nRelated Roundups: iPad mini, iPad, iPad Air \nTag: September 2021 Apple Event\nBuyer's Guide: iPad Mini (Buy Now), iPad (Buy Now), iPad Air (Neutral)\nRelated Forum: iPad\nThis article, \"iPad Air Now the Only iPad in Apple's Lineup That Lacks 12MP Ultra Wide Front Camera With Center Stage\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The ‌iPhone 13‌ models still support eSIM and nano-SIM, but also support two eSIMs for adopting carrier plans without a physical SIM card.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple's ‌iPhone 13‌ models will not ship with a physical SIM card this year and carriers will instead use eSIM capabilities for activation. Because eSIM activation is being used for devices connected to a carrier when ordering, a WiFi connection will be needed for setup. From Apple:\r\n\r\nCarrier-connected iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro models will arrive ready to activate with eSIM and can connect to your cellular voice and data service without a physical SIM card. You will need a Wi-Fi connection for setup.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo activate eSIM on an unconnected iPhone, please contact the carrier of your choice when you're ready.\n\r\n\r\nConnecting with a carrier later can be done by inserting a physical SIM or contacting a carrier for eSIM activation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ‌iPhone 13‌ models will be available for pre-order on Friday, September 17, and will officially launch on Friday, September 24.\nThis article, \"iPhone 13 Models Support Dual eSIMs\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The notch is indeed a good bit smaller, and the tiny increase in height is barely noticeable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new notch design is in line with rumors that we heard during the beta testing period, which pointed to a design that was more compact and just a tiny bit taller.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext year, Apple may do away with the notch entirely.

          "description": "At today's \"California Streaming\" event, Apple announced a new USB-C Apple Watch charging puck designed specifically with the Series 7 models in mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPriced at $29, the Apple Watch Magnetic Fast Charger to USB-C cable can charge an Apple Watch Series 7 33 percent faster than the standard Apple Watch charging puck, reaching an 80 percent charge in 45 minutes.\nWe wanted to make charging your Apple Watch utterly effortless. And now, it charges up to 33% faster when paired with Apple Watch Series 7, so you can reach 80% charge in about 45 minutes. Simply hold the connector near the back of the watch, where magnets cause it to snap into place automatically. It's a completely sealed system free of exposed contacts. And it's very forgiving, requiring no precise alignment.\nTo enable the faster charging speeds, the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ has an updated charging architecture inside. The fast charging technology is limited to the Series 7 for this reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new Apple Watch charging puck can be purchased from Apple's website starting today, but the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ models won't be launching until later this fall. When available, the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ will likely ship with the new fast charging cable as it has the same price point as the standard cable. \nRelated Roundup: Apple Watch Series 6\nTag: Apple Watch Series 7\nBuyer's Guide: Apple Watch (Don't Buy)\nRelated Forum: Apple Watch\nThis article, \"Apple Now Selling USB-C Magnetic Charger for Fast Charging Apple Watch Series 7 Models\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Apple will also be surveying the Region of Durham immediately east of Toronto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple says it is committed to protecting the public's privacy while conducting these surveys. In line with Google's Street View, Apple censors faces and license plates in imagery made available through its Look Around feature. If you have comments or questions about this process, your privacy rights, or would like to request that a face, license plate, or your own house be censored, Apple says to email mapsimagecollection@apple.com.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduced in iOS 13, Look Around provides 3D street-level imagery that can be zoomed and panned.

The yellow, orange, and purple colors cannot be purchased in stores and must be ordered online.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe change will make it easier for customers who want one of the more unusual ‌iMac‌ colors to get an ‌iMac‌ right away without having to wait for shipping. It may also mean that third-party stores will be able to carry additional colors, as retailers like Best Buy have also been limited to green, pink, blue, and silver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are highly anticipated redesigned 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro models that are in the works, but unfortunately, we are not expecting these new machines at the September event.

This sale is just a couple of cents off from the lowest price we've ever seen on this accessory, and it's one of the best prices available online this week. It's also being matched at Walmart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe MagSafe Charger perfectly aligns with the magnets on the iPhone 12 family of devices and provides wireless charging. It also maintains compatibility with Qi charging, so any iPhone 8 or later device can still use it, as well as AirPods with a Wireless Charging Case and AirPods Pro.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n$9 OFF\nMagSafe Charger for $29.98\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor optimal charging, Apple recommends using a 20W USB-C Power Adapter with the MagSafe Charger, but it's sold separately. However, Costco members this week can save on both of these accessories when bundled together, priced at $39.99. Individually, the 20W USB-C Power Adapter costs $19.00 and the MagSafe Charger costs $39.00, so you're essentially getting the Power Adapter at no extra cost with this deal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, you'll need to be a Costco member to see the deal and be able to purchase it. You'll have until September 10 before the sale ends, and there is a limit of two per member.

When paired with AirPods Pro or AirPods Max, the ‌Apple TV‌ supports Spatial audio for a theater-like surround sound experience, and there's a new feature for automatically connecting your AirPods through Smart ‌AirPods‌ routing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHey Siri commands can be used to launch Apple TV+ shows, and two HomePod mini speakers can be paired with the ‌Apple TV‌ 4K for stereo sound.

Other recent colorful product additions for Anker include the lavender grey and mint green versions of the original Anker Nano, several color options for its PowerLine cables, and even the MagSafe-compatible PowerCore Magnetic 5K.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor those looking for a bit more versatility in Anker's lineup of diminutive power adapters, the company is also working on a Nano Pro Dual that will feature 40 watts of charging power and two ports. More information and a launch date for that model will be coming at a later date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe single-port Anker Nano Pro is available now from Amazon and is priced at $19.99.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Anker and Amazon.

In the equipment section of the filing, Apple lists four \"New Phone\" items while also listing A2176, A2172, A2341, and A2342, which correspond to the iPhone 12 mini, ‌iPhone 12‌, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max, respectively, as \"legacy\" devices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEarlier in the summer, Apple registered four new iPhone models in the EEC database, providing us with model IDs for the upcoming iPhones. However, today's new filing doesn't include any model numbers for the \"New Phone\" items, making it difficult to tie a connection between the filing and the EEC entry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmongst the features expected for the iPhone 13, Apple is expected to be improving the strength of the MagSafe magnets on the back of the new iPhones.

          "description": "A former Chrysler proving grounds for automotive testing outside of Phoenix, Arizona, that has been rumored to be used by Apple was recently purchased for $125 million by the firm that has been leasing it for the past five years, according to AZ Big Media.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBack in 2017, it was reported that a company by the name of Route 14 Investment Partners LLC had signed a lease to use the facility, with rumors suggesting Apple was behind the deal, although there was no definitive proof of the link. Route 14 is represented by the Phoenix office of law firm Greenberg Traurig, hiding the true ownership of the company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRoute 14 has now exercised an option to purchase the property, which consists of 34 separate parcels, for $125 million in cash. The purchase agreement is dated June 25, 2021, with a deed and assumption of an existing development agreement with the City of Surprise both dated July 30 and seen by MacRumors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have still not been able to concretely tie Apple to Route 14, but it's clear that whoever is behind the firm has deep pockets and a long-term interest in the testing facility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRumors about Apple's work on both autonomous driving systems and actual electric vehicles have ebbed and flowed over the last several years.

          "description": "Apple may be exploring the possibility of using an open-source alternative to the Arm architecture, which it's been using in its products for decades.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to a newly posted job alert, spotted by Tom's Hardware, Apple is looking for an engineer that specializes in RISC-V, an open-source architecture instruction set that allows device makers to build their own chips without having to pay a license or royalty. Apple currently uses the Arm architecture in its products, and it pays the company a royalty fee to use its instruction set. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple's job posting description states that the engineer will implement \"innovative RISC-V solutions and state of the art routines\" to Apple's products. Specifically, Apple hopes prospective engineers will be able to work with the RISC-V instruction set, as well as have an understanding of Arm. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTom's Hardware theorizes that if Apple were to adopt the open-source instruction set of RISC-V, it may save the company money because it wouldn't need to pay Arm a license fee for its instruction set.\r\n\r\nEvery Arm core requires Apple to pay a licensing fee to Arm, and since the number of cores for things like SSD controllers and smartwatches will only increase, so will Apple's payments to Arm. As such, replacing at least some Arm cores with RISC-V cores could save Apple millions of dollars in royalty payments every year...\nThe job listing is a confirmation that Apple is exploring the use of RISC-V, but whether the company decides to implement the open-source technology remains to be seen. Apple's reliance on Arm has increased in the past year as Apple is in the process of switching its Mac lineup to Arm-based processors rather than Intel.\nTag: Arm\nThis article, \"Apple Possibly Exploring Open-Source Alternative to Arm Architecture\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Twitter is planning new privacy-related features that provide users with greater control over follower lists and who can see their posts and likes, reports Bloomberg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plans are said to include an option to archive old tweets so that other users can't see them after a set period of time designated by the account holder (such as 30, 60, or 90 days, or a whole year), as well as the ability to edit follower lists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Bloomberg, the plans are an effort to make people more comfortable interacting and sharing on Twitter, and are related to what Twitter executives call \"social privacy,\" or how users manage their identities and reputations on the social network. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInternal research at the company reportedly found that many Twitter users don't understand the privacy basics, like whether their account is private or public, which causes them to engage less on the social network because they don't know what other people will be able to see about them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo counter this, Twitter will start prompting users to review whether their accounts are public or private beginning in September. Its privacy team are also working on other potential changes including the ability to remove followers (as opposed to blocking them), hide liked tweets, and remove oneself from a public conversation. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwitter has no timeline for some of the changes, while some features, like the archive option, are still in the \"concept phase,\" but Twitter plans to let people remove followers starting this month, and to let users remove themselves from conversations by the end of the year.\nTags: Twitter, bloomberg.com\nThis article, \"Twitter's Privacy Feature Plans Include Option to Hide Your Old Tweets\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

His Christmas plans hit a snag when the home owner's association tells him his planned event violates neighborhood rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis leads to a man vs. HOA fight over the festivities, and the dispute snowballs out of control.\nProduced by Dorothy Street Pictures, the doc follows the story of a North Idaho neighborhood turned upside down by one man's obsession with bringing Christmas cheer to all, through the biggest community Christmas event America has ever seen. Christmas-loving lawyer Jeremy Morris' plan hits a snag when the home owners' association informs him that the event violates the rules of the neighborhood. A contentious fight over the festivities erupts and things snowball out of control. As the situation escalates, the film asks the question, who wins when different rights and interests collide? Director Read pieces together the polarized perspectives in this quirky Christmas tale about freedoms, with a message about differences and tolerance at its heart.\nThe film is directed by Becky Read, who produced \"Three Identical Strangers,\" a documentary about triplets who were separated at birth and adopted by different families.\nTags: Apple TV Shows, Apple TV Plus\nThis article, \"Apple Inks Deal for 'The Fight Before Christmas' Documentary\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Some observers are speculating that each Super Follow in-app purchase will have to be set up manually by Twitter on the ‌App Store‌, making the system even more unconventional.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ‌App Store‌ does not allow for multiple instances of the same subscription, leading other platforms such as YouTube and Twitch to get around this by effectively allowing users to buy a sub-token that can be directed toward a specific creator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis means that there will be thousands of Twitter in-app purchases, dwarfing Twitter's own Twitter Blue subscription and Ticketed Spaces, Twitter's ‌App Store‌ page will only show 10 in-app purchases since it would be impractical to show the entire list.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple only allows developers to create up to 10,000 in-app purchases, so it is not clear if Twitter will limit the users eligible to sell Super Follows at 10,000 minus Ticketed Spaces and Twitter Blue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwitter announced Super Follows earlier this year, allowing creators with at least 10,000 Followers to charge up to $9.99 per month as a subscription for access to exclusive tweets. Twitter takes a three percent cut of Super Follow subscriptions up to a total of $50,000, making Apple's 30 percent in-app purchase fee markedly larger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe feature finally launched yesterday, starting in the United States and Canada, but it will be rolling out globally on iOS in the next few weeks.\nTags: App Store, Twitter\nThis article, \"Twitter Super Follows Use a Bizarre System That Gives Each User Their Own In-App Purchase\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Apple is rumored to be in Asia visiting Toyota as it prepares to lay the supplier groundwork to mass produce a branded car by 2024, according to a new report by DigiTimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple representatives were said to have met with South Korea's SK Group and LG Electronics last month to discuss Apple Car development, and now Japan's Toyota is being touted as its next potential destination. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple has been working on a car-related project since at least 2014, and at one stage it looked as if the company was scaling back to focus on autonomous vehicle software. However, following several changes in management and hiring, Apple is now believed to be focused on building a car for consumers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut to do that, the company needs to tap into a whole new supply chain. Apple is expected to rely on a manufacturing partner to build the vehicles, and though it wants to make EV batteries in the United States, it may be seeking partnerships with established vehicle makers like Toyota to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReuters has previously reported that Apple is developing a new battery design that has the potential to \"radically\" reduce the cost of batteries and increase the vehicle's range.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne person who spoke to Reuters described Apple's \"monocle\" battery technology as \"next level\" and said that it's similar to \"the first time you saw the iPhone.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReuters' reporting claimed that Apple is aiming to begin production on an Apple-branded self-driving vehicle starting in 2024, so DigiTimes' focus on that date isn't necessarily a shot in the dark. However, delays caused by the ongoing global health crisis or current chip shortage could always push production to 2025 or beyond.\nRelated Roundup: Apple Car\nTags: digitimes.com, Toyota\nRelated Forum: Apple, Inc and Tech Industry\nThis article, \"Apple Reportedly in Talks With Toyota About Apple Car Production Starting 2024\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Eve today released an update to its latest version of the Eve Thermo that adds Thread support to the HomeKit-enabled smart radiator valve (via HomeKitNews).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe update fulfills a pledge the German company made late last year to bring Thread support to several products, and follows its inclusion in devices like the Eve Energy Smart plug (fourth generation), Eve Aqua (second generation), Eve Weather, and Eve Door & Window (third generation).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a quick explainer, Thread is a low latency and low power mesh-like network for smart devices. Unlike Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, the Thread standard doesn't depend on a router or hub. Instead, the smart device itself extends the network by talking to other Thread-enabled devices, thereby boosting the signal between them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple's HomePod mini and the latest Apple TV 4K act as Thread border routers, and by adding Thread-supported devices around the home, users can typically expect improved connectivity compared to Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, a wider control range, and more remote scheduling options.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn related news, version 5.3 of the Eve app adds support for its upcoming HomeKit-enabled MothionBlinds, which are expected to launch sometime this year. \nTags: HomeKit, Eve, Thread\nThis article, \"Eve Adds Thread Support to HomeKit-Enabled Thermo Smart Radiator Valve\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The Lexus RX 450h was stopped in traffic and was hit by a Hyundai. The accident was described as minor with no injuries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second accident [PDF] occurred on August 23 in Cupertino, California, right near the Apple Park campus. The vehicle with Apple's self-driving equipment was in manual mode and it was stopped in traffic when it was rear ended by a Subaru Outback.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth of these incidents were not the fault of the self-driving vehicle or the person operating the vehicle, and are largely not notable. What is interesting, though, is that Apple vehicles were involved in two collisions in the same month after no accidents since September 2019.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEarlier this year, the California DMV's disengagement and mileage reports suggested that Apple's Lexus SUVs with self-driving software traversed more than 18,000 miles in 2020, a steep increase compared to prior years. It's possible that Apple has ramped up its testing in 2021, leading to a higher number of incidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple has been testing its self-driving software since early 2017, using the aforementioned Lexus RX 450h vehicles outfitted with sensors and cameras.

The addition of a Bitcoin tipping option comes after Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey told investors in July that Bitcoin was important to the company and would be coming to the Tip Jar in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDetails in the latest Twitter beta indicate that users will be directed through a Bitcoin tutorial that includes details on the Bitcoin Lightning Network and custodial and non-custodial Bitcoin wallets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwitter gives Strike, Blue Wallet and Wallet of Satoshi as examples of custodial wallets and Muun, Breez, Phoenix and Zap as examples of non-custodial wallets. Twitter also informs users that a Strike account is required. \"We use Strike to generate Bitcoin Lightning invoices so you'll need to connect your account to accept Bitcoin tips\" reads the text.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwitter also appears to be working on \"Cheer,\" \"Haha,\" \"Hmm,\" \"Like,\" and \"Sad\" reactions to tweets that users will be able to activate using a press and hold gesture on the current like button.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBitcoin support for tips is limited to the Twitter beta at this time and is not yet available for all beta users, so it is not yet clear when the Bitcoin feature will see an official release.

Kids will only be able to play online games for an hour a day (8:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m.) on weekends and legal holidays. Weekday gaming is prohibited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCompanies that provide online game services to minors will need to comply with these rules and will not be able to offer the games to children outside of those hours. Gaming providers will also be required to have users register with their real names and users will need to be logged in to play. Gaming companies are responsible for ensuring minors are not accessing games outside of the permitted time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new rules are meant to safeguard children's physical and mental health, and the National Press and Public Administration said that the guidelines address \"the problem of minors' excessive use\" of online gaming. China previously had a restriction that limited gameplay to 1.5 hours per day, but gaming was allowed on most days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTencent, a major gaming provider in China, said that only a small amount of its gaming revenue comes from younger players. The company plans to implement the new requirements, and earlier today, expressed support for the rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's not clear how these new rules will affect games that operate using the App Store. Apple Arcade is not a factor as it is not offered in China, but there are ‌App Store‌ games that require an online connection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChina in 2016 began requiring mobile gaming developers to officially license their games with the government, and in 2020, pressured Apple to remove ‌App Store‌ games from developers that did not comply.

Speaking to the Australian Financial Review, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said that the recommendations would be carefully considered:\nUltimately, if we do nothing to reform the current framework, it will be Silicon Valley alone that determines the future of our payments system, a critical piece of our economic infrastructure.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder current Australian law, the likes of ‌Apple Pay‌ are not classified as payment systems, putting them outside payment regulations. Classifying ‌Apple Pay‌ as a payment system would clarify the regulatory status of digital wallets in Australia and allow the government to explicitly designate big tech companies as payment providers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther recommendations, contingent on classifying ‌Apple Pay‌ as a payment system, look to establish a strategy for the country's wider payments ecosystem with a single, integrated licensing framework.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAustralian banks such as the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia have previously raised concerns around the growth of digital wallets with \"competition issues\" and purported safety implications.

Gurman says that Apple plans to make the larger screen real-estate worthwhile by bundling it with new Apple Watch faces that utilize the larger displays.  \r\n\r\nThis year's watches will come in 41-millimeter and 45-millimeter sizes, up from 40 and 44 millimeters. I'm told that Apple will bundle multiple new watch faces to take advantage of the bigger screen, including an updated Infograph Modular face. This will be the second time in the Apple Watch's history that the company has increased the display size, following the Apple Watch Series 4 in 2017. \nThe new Apple Watch faces will be exclusive to the Series 7 and will likely not be made available through a software update for older models. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides cosmetic changes, the Apple Watch Series 7 is expected to include improved performance and battery life.

Sumbul Desai, Apple's vice president of health efforts, and Kristina Raspe, vice president in charge of real estate, are also hosting talks to encourage employees to get the shots.\nThe webpage Apple has created explains the delta variant and how getting vaccinated can help prevent its spread. Apple is also offering vouchers for employees to get vaccinated through Walgreens, and it is providing on-site vaccinations in the San Francisco Bay Area and Austin, Texas. Apple gives employees paid time off for vaccine appointments and paid sick leave for those who experience side effects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple is not mandating that its employees get vaccinated, which is a departure from other tech companies in the area. Both Google and Facebook are requiring employees to be vaccinated, but according to Bloomberg, Apple has not done so for the sake of employee privacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEarlier this month, Apple implemented more frequent testing for corporate and retail employees, asking them to take COVID-19 tests up to three times per week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple initially planned to have employees return to work for three days a week in September, but with cases continuing to ramp up, corporate employees will be able to work from home until at least January 2022.\nThis article, \"Apple Expands Efforts to Vaccinate Employees, But Doesn't Mandate Vaccines\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Behold! The Headphone Jack, on the Google Pixel 5a with 5G.\nSince Jony Ive is no longer Apple's design chief and does not make Apple's product videos, it's not clear why Google has opted to make a video imitating him two years after he left the company. A video promoting the headphone jack is also an unusual choice as fervor over the component has died down now that many high-end smartphones have eliminated it, including Google's own flagship Pixel models. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe $449 Pixel 5a goes on sale today. In addition to a headphone jack, it features a 6.3-inch display with hole punch camera cutout, IP67 water resistance, 5G connectivity, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G chip.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGoogle's Pixel 5a competes with the $699 iPhone 12 mini and the $399 iPhone SE at the current time, but Apple plans to release an upgraded 5G version of the iPhone SE for 2022.\nTags: Google, Google Pixel\nThis article, \"Google Channels Jony Ive in Ad Promoting Pixel 5a Headphone Jack\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "The Apple Watch continues to be the most popular smart watch on the market, and in Q2 2021, Apple hit a new user base milestone, according to Counterpoint Research's Global Smartwatch Shipments Tracker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are now more than 100 million active Apple Watch users thanks to the device's design, health features, and related services. It's possible Apple hit this milestone even earlier than 2021, as Neil Cybart said in February that based on his estimates, Apple reached 100 million users in December.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the second quarter of 2021, global smart watch shipments were up 27 percent overall, and Apple was able to maintain its number one position. Apple's market share was at 28 percent, down slightly from 30 percent in the year-ago quarter, but well above competitors like Huawei, Samsung, and Garmin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe United States continues to be Apple's largest market, responsible for more than half of the Apple Watch user base.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the quarter, the Apple Watch Series 6 was the most popular smart watch overall, followed by the Apple Watch SE. The Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 took the third spot, followed by the Apple Watch Series 3 in fourth and the Imoo Z6-4G in fifth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple in just a few weeks is set to debut its newest wrist-worn device, the Apple Watch Series 7. The Series 7 will feature the first redesign we've seen in years, with Apple adopting a flat-edged design, a larger display, and new 41mm and 45mm case sizes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe're expecting Apple to debut the new Apple Watch Series 7 models alongside the iPhone 13 lineup, and we could be hearing details on an event date within the next two weeks.\nRelated Roundup: Apple Watch Series 6\nTag: Counterpoint\nBuyer's Guide: Apple Watch (Don't Buy)\nRelated Forum: Apple Watch\nThis article, \"More Than 100 Million People Worldwide Use an Apple Watch\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Google has rolled out picture-in-picture support as an \"experimental\" feature for YouTube premium subscribers, allowing them to watch video in a small window when the app is closed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you're a premium YouTube subscriber looking to try out picture-in-picture, follow these steps: \r\n\r\n\nLaunch a web browser and sign into your YouTube account at YouTube.com.\r\n\r\nNavigate to www.youtube.com/new.\n\r\n\r\nScroll down to \"Picture-in-picture on iOS\".\n\r\n\r\nClick \"Try it out.\"\nNow, when you're in the YouTube app watching a video, return to your Home Screen by swiping up/pressing the Home button, and the picture-in-picture mini player will pop up. Google notes that locking your phone when watching in picture-in-picture mode will pause the video, but you can resume it by using the Lock Screen media controls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGoogle in June announced that picture-in-picture support would be rolling out to both premium and non-paying YouTube app users in the U.S., but some people outside the U.S. have been able to get the experimental feature working, so it could be globally available. \r\n\r\n\nHow to Use Picture in Picture Mode on iPhone\n\r\n\r\nHowever, Google says the feature is only available until October 31. The company doesn't explain what happens after that, but hopefully that's when support rolls out to both paying subscribers and non-paying users, as originally promised. Whether it will still be available globally outside of its \"experimental\" context remains to be seen, though.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Via 9to5Google.)\nTags: YouTube, Picture in Picture\nThis article, \"YouTube Premium Subscribers Can Now Use iOS Picture-in-Picture: Here's How\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Apple may be planning to launch the iPhone 13 on Friday, September 17 and third-generation AirPods on Thursday, September 30, according to an image of an e-commerce app discovered by Chinese language site IT Home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe screenshot, originally posted by Weibo account @PandaIsBald, suggests all four ‌iPhone 13‌ models will go on sale on September 17, followed by the ‌AirPods‌ 3 on September 30.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApart from the image, which could be easily faked, IT Home offers no other information to back up the claim, and the website has shared screenshots in the past that turned out to be inaccurate, so the above information should be taken with a hefty dose of salt. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat said, with Apple returning to its traditional September launch timeline, the above dates could easily turn out to be correct. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives has suggested the iPhone will launch in the third week of September, which would be the week of September 13 to 17. Based on past launch events, September 7, September 14, and September 21 are all likely event dates where we could see the new ‌iPhone‌ models unveiled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new ‌iPhone 13‌ models will focus heavily on camera capabilities, including ProRes and portrait mode for videos. The new handsets will also include a smaller notch, larger batteries, and improved performance. Apple's third-generation ‌AirPods‌ are expected to have a form factor similar to the AirPods Pro, featuring a new case, a shorter stem, and perhaps replaceable ear tips.\nRelated Roundups: AirPods, iPhone 13\nBuyer's Guide: AirPods (Don't Buy)\nRelated Forums: AirPods, iPhone\nThis article, \"iPhone 13 to Launch on September 17, AirPods 3 on September 30, Claims Report\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Google-owned Fitbit appears to be readying an update to its Charge fitness tracker lineup, based on a leaked video and renders of the wearable shared online. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\npic.twitter.com/tsJbpTwgLx\n— Evan (@evleaks) August 14, 2021\n \n\r\n\r\nWith a price tag said to be $179, the Fitbit Charge 5 will be $50 more expensive than the current Charge 4, but there are some obvious hardware changes on the way that have more in common with the Fitbit luxe, not least being a full-color rounded display that traces the curve of the ergonomic wrist strap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe images suggest the device will have capacitive touch areas on the sides, and according to the leaked video, the Charge 5 will additionally have built-in GPS and ECG sensors, as well as an electrodermal activity (EDA) sensor that claims to track your stress levels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe EDA sensor plays into the company's Daily Readiness Score, which is a subscriber-only Fitbit Premium feature ($10 per month or $80 per year). The score is based on your exercise history, sleep, and heart rate, and is used to recommend what exercise routine you should undertake each day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nFitbit Charge 5\n179 USDhttps://t.co/6bhJFPBI6x\n— Snoopy (@_snoopytech_) August 22, 2021\n \n\r\n\r\nEvery device purchased comes with a six-month trial of Fitbit Premium, which is clearly competing with Apple Watch and its Apple Fitness+ integration, with guided workouts and programs on offer on top of sleep tools and other health insights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fitbit Charge will be available in at least three colors, and there's no word on the specific release date for the fitness tracker-cum-smartwatch, but Google is likely to place it strategically around the launch of the Apple Watch Series 7 that's expected to be announced in the next month or so.\nTag: Fitbit\nThis article, \"Fitbit Charge 5 Tracker Design and Features Leaked in New Video\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

He was annoyed by the same jarring automatic switch between the 1× to 0.5× lens when entering or leaving macro mode that I mentioned in my review:\nI welcome greater detail for close-ups and it’s clever that Apple\nis using the ultra-wide to augment the 1× wide and 3× telephoto at\nshort distances, but the transitioning of cameras is disorienting.\nApple makes no mention of this camera switching/augmenting on its\niPhone 13 Pro website. I get that it’s supposed to be one of those\n“it just works” features. At least that was Apple’s intention I’m\ntold, but it just doesn’t.\nHere’s a screen recording of the automatic camera switching in\naction. In this shot, I was trying to frame these delicious soup\ndumplings using the grid. Holding the iPhone 13 Pro still, you can\nsee the 1× wide switching to another slightly different FOV that’s\nusing the ultra-wide autofocusing. The viewfinder keeps jittering\nas it tries to choose between a regular wide or wide-macro shot. A\nregular person wouldn’t look at this and think to themselves, this\nis normal. They’d look at the jittering and think something is\nbroken with their iPhone camera. The framing should never change\nfrom what you compose and never automatically.\nWong’s screen recording illustrates the issue perfectly.\nWhen I first pressed Apple and made them aware of the jarring\ncamera switching, I was told it’s how the camera system works. On\nthe eve of this review, Apple changed course and said it’s going\nto release a software update to let users disable the camera\nswitching. According to Apple:\nA new setting will be added in a software update this fall to turn\noff automatic camera switching when shooting at close distances\nfor macro photography and video.\n ★",

          "description": "Dieter Bohn, writing for The Verge:\nApple’s marketing for the camera system on the 13 Pro is that it’s\nthe “biggest advancement ever.” I don’t know that I would go that\nfar, but I also can’t remember the last time I’ve said “whoa, look\nat this photo” as many times as I have during this review. […]\nWhere the Pro 13 camera system shines is in low light. The main\nwide-angle sensor has seen a massive upgrade this year. Unlike\nAndroid phones that are chasing big megapixel counts and then\n“pixel binning” to achieve low light performance, Apple is\nsticking with 12 megapixels, the same resolution it’s used since\n2015’s iPhone 6S. The sensor itself is much bigger now and\nfeatures 1.9 µm pixels, which are about as big as anything we’ve\nseen on a smartphone. And on top of all that, the lens now has an\nƒ/1.5 aperture.\nAll of that adds up to a camera that can very quickly take in a\nmassive amount of light relative to other phones. Combined with\nsome tuning and improvements to Apple’s computational photography,\nthe low light performance on the 13 Pro is simply second to none.\nI came away super impressed with the low light performance of the 13 Pro, too.\nBohn makes an important point in his corresponding review of the 13 and 13 Mini too: because the camera bumps are all new sizes, cases for the iPhone 13 won’t fit the 13 Pro, nor vice-versa.\n ★",

          "description": "Apple Newsroom, back on August 30:\nPrimephonic is no longer available for new subscribers and will be\ntaken offline beginning September 7. Apple Music plans to launch a\ndedicated classical music app next year combining Primephonic’s\nclassical user interface that fans have grown to love with more\nadded features. In the meantime, current Primephonic subscribers\nwill receive six months of Apple Music for free, providing access\nto hundreds of thousands of classical albums, all in Lossless and\nhigh-resolution audio, as well as hundreds of classical albums in\nApple Music’s Spatial Audio, with new albums added regularly.\nI’ve had this flagged for a few weeks. What I find interesting is Apple is going to use this acquisition to launch a dedicated classical music app, not to expand the Music app. iTunes, infamously, expanded greatly over the years, and everyone seems to agree that the user experience suffered for it. I wonder if that’s in the back of Apple’s mind here.\n ★",

The new model doesn’t sport the big\ndesign refresh multiple sources said was coming. It doesn’t even\npack a new chip.\nIs this the upgrade Apple wanted to deliver this year? Or is it\na last-minute substitution that Cupertino had to settle on\nbecause the refresh it really wanted to deliver just wasn’t\nready to roll out?\nBased on the evidence, we’re going to say it’s the latter.\nThe only way this could be funnier is if Bell included the theory that perhaps Apple changed the hardware at the last minute because the flat-edge designs leaked.\nThis is not how hardware works. These designs are set long in advance. In fact, from what I’ve heard, the flat-edge watch designs might be legitimate leaks, but they’re next year’s designs. That’s how far in advance Apple works on hardware — they were already in the advanced stages of designing the 2022 Apple Watches months ago. (Aesthetically, I am not sold on a flat-edge design for the watch. The round edges are iconic and organic.)\nYou can argue that Series 7 is a marginal upgrade over Series 6, but with an all-new screen (brighter and bigger), all-new crystal (more durable), and 33 percent faster charging, there are upgrades, and none of them could be slapped together.\n ★",

During the course of the\nanalysis we obtained an iTunes backup of the device.\nRecent re-analysis of the backup yielded several files with the\n“.gif” extension in Library/SMS/Attachments that we determined\nwere sent to the phone immediately before it was hacked with NSO\nGroup’s Pegasus spyware.\nBecause the format of the files matched two types of crashes we\nhad observed on another phone when it was hacked with Pegasus, we\nsuspected that the “.gif” files might contain parts of what we are\ncalling the FORCEDENTRY exploit chain.\nCitizen Lab forwarded the artifacts to Apple on Tuesday, September\n7. On Monday, September 13, Apple confirmed that the files\nincluded a zero-day exploit against iOS and MacOS. They designated\nthe FORCEDENTRY exploit CVE-2021-30860, and describe it as\n“processing a maliciously crafted PDF may lead to arbitrary code\nexecution.”\nThe files with the “.gif” extension weren’t actually GIF files — they were carefully-crafted malformed PSD and PDF files that triggered image processing bugs.

But fuck these “religious” exemptions. If your “religion” forbids you from being vaccinated, that’s not a religion, that’s a cult.\nSo where’s Apple on this? Why isn’t Apple requiring proof of vaccination for employees, including for retail employees and customers? Why reserve courageous decisions only for removing headphone jacks?\n ★",

But our patience is wearing thin, and your\nrefusal has cost all of us,” he said, all but biting off his\nwords.

Yes, mandating anything is an extraordinary use of authority, but this pandemic is clearly the most extraordinary crisis most of us have ever lived through.

Plastic\nbags account for over 10,000 hours of lost staff time and pose a\ndanger to workers at recycling facilities because they get caught\nin the equipment. Banning plastic bags will make our city cleaner,\nreduce waste and save money.\nI’ve been reading Millions, Billions, Zillions by Brian Kernighan (who is apparently a computer scientist of some renown). It’s a great book ($11 in hardcover from Amazon; BookShop.org link to indie booksellers), and Kernighan’s writing style is as buttery smooth as ever. One of the things he does is encourage back-of-the-envelope math on numbers like the above, when you encounter them. Does it make sense that Philadelphians use 1 billion plastic bags per year?\nPhilly has about 1.6 million residents. 1 billion divided by 1.6 million is 625 plastic bags per person per year, about 12 bags per person per week, or 1.7 bags per person per day. When I consider how often stores double-bag anything vaguely heavy, that seems plausible. (There’s also the fact that Philly gets many tourists, and in normal times there are many non-residents who commute into the city daily for work. Feel free to bump 1.6 million to a higher number, but for ballpark “does this figure make sense” purposes, I think the Census figure is fine.)\n10,000 annual hours of lost staff time is high, but seems plausible too: That’s about 192 hours per week, or about 5 full-time employees.\n ★",

If you or anyone you know is getting a new iPhone soon, I would strongly recommend one of Anker’s chargers over Apple’s — same speed, same price, much smaller, and a few color options to top it off.\nAnother Anker charger I’ve been meaning to recommend is the Atom PowerPort III Slim. It’s a 30-watt charger currently on sale for $19, and what makes it different is that it’s, well, very slim (including folding prongs).

After seven years,\nApple Pay’s adoption and usage isn’t much larger than it was 2015\n(5.1%), a year after its launch, and is the same as it was in\n2019, the last full year before the pandemic.\nIt doesn’t really make sense to me that adoption isn’t much higher than it was in 2015, and if these survey results are accurate, I find them surprisingly low. I’d have guessed somewhere in the 15–20 percent range. If it’s true adoption is this low, I think one factor could be first impressions — my wife got turned off by Apple Pay in the earlier years because so many retail terminals that supposedly accepted it were so finicky. Using an old-fashioned credit card was more reliable. Also, habits. But I use Apple Pay today whenever I can, and I find it more reliable than tap-and-pay with a physical card.\nNick Heer, writing at Pixel Envy:\nThis survey shows an approximately flat use rate from 2019 through\n2021, down slightly from 2018. Webster writes that the pandemic\nought to have “changed the trajectory of Apple Pay” as\n“contactless and touchless have become the consumer’s checkout\nmantra”. But anyone with a Face ID-equipped iPhone can tell you\nthat wearing a mask requires you to authenticate by using your\npasscode, so it has been far easier for the past eighteen months\nto simply tap a card. That is probably true generally, as well;\nApple Pay may have better privacy and security, but it is no\neasier to use than a card that supports tap to pay, even without\nthe added complication of pandemic precautions.\nApple Pay with Apple Watch works well while wearing a face mask, but using your iPhone sucks.\n ★",

New York Times All Access digital\nand home delivery subscribers will continue to receive unlimited\naccess to Wirecutter’s 1,200+ product reviews, deals coverage and\nother guides to help them shop confidently online with their\nexisting subscription. A standalone subscription to Wirecutter is\navailable for $5 every four weeks or $40 annually.\nThis makes sense, and in my opinion, the Times’s paywall rules are among the best in the industry, in terms of offering a generous number of free reads to non-subscribers. But it’s one less “free for everyone to read” high-quality site.\n(I have always enjoyed Wirecutter, going back to when they debuted (and had a leading The), but I wish they had a rival that focused less on price. Wirecutter recommendations are very often skewed to the best low-priced product, not the best product in a category, period. I want domain experts to tell me the best products — I can make up my own mind on how much I want to spend.)\n ★",

The gist is, each Twitter user offering Super Follows gets its own distinct IAP. If there are 1,000 users offering Super Follows, there are 1,000 discrete IAPs in the App Store. If there are 10,000 users offering them, 10,000 IAPs. If there are 100,000, our heads explode.\nThis is incredible. Ostensibly, Twitter is doing what Apple wants them to do. Right now Super Follows payments are even exclusive to iOS. (Once you pay on iOS, you can see Super Follow content on Twitter’s Android and web clients, too, but the only way to pay is on iOS through IAP.) But Apple’s IAP system is so brittle that Twitter has to make a discrete SKU for each and every Super Follow user, and pay Apple 30 percent of the price for the privilege. (Twitter, per its published terms, takes just 3 percent of the first $50,000 in lifetime earnings, then 20 percent after that.) Also, because Apple’s IAP listings in the App Store rank IAP offerings by popularity, Twitter is being forced to reveal data that they quite likely would prefer to keep to themselves.\n ★",

This is where we are, mentally, when considering App\nStore rules in 2021.\nI have a friend who works at a company with a somewhat popular “reader” app that everyone has heard of, who says that internally, there’s a contingent that suspects Apple is going to require these apps to also offer Apple’s IAP to be allowed to include a link to their website.\nThat’s how much trust Apple has burned.\nThe spirit of Apple’s settlement with the Japan Fair Trade Commission is clear: these “reader” apps are going to be permitted to link users to their websites for signing up and buying media like e-books, movies, and music. Within that spirit, of course they’re going to be allowed to have text explaining this, and of course they’re not going to be required to also offer Apple’s IAP for these same purchases.\nBut very reasonable, smart people are genuinely skeptical that Apple is going to adhere to the spirit of this settlement.\nCall me a fool, but I think Apple is going to follow through and do the right thing by these apps. There are a lot of negative adjectives that I’d apply to Apple regarding the App Store. Greedy, inconsistent, frustrating, shortsighted, capricious, technically illiterate. Did I say greedy?

          "description": "This is actually big news from Apple:\nApple today announced an update coming to the App Store that\ncloses an investigation by the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC).\nThe update will allow developers of “reader” apps to include an\nin-app link to their website for users to set up or manage an\naccount. While the agreement was made with the JFTC, Apple will\napply this change globally to all reader apps on the store. Reader\napps provide previously purchased content or content subscriptions\nfor digital magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, and video.\nTo ensure a safe and seamless user experience, the App Store’s\nguidelines require developers to sell digital services and\nsubscriptions using Apple’s in-app payment system. Because\ndevelopers of reader apps do not offer in-app digital goods and\nservices for purchase, Apple agreed with the JFTC to let\ndevelopers of these apps share a single link to their website to\nhelp users set up and manage their account. […]\n“Trust on the App Store is everything to us. The focus of the App\nStore is always to create a safe and secure experience for users,\nwhile helping them find and use great apps on the devices they\nlove,” said Phil Schiller, Apple Fellow who oversees the App\nStore. “We have great respect for the Japan Fair Trade Commission\nand appreciate the work we’ve done together, which will help\ndevelopers of reader apps make it easier for users to set up and\nmanage their apps and services, while protecting their privacy and\nmaintaining their trust.”\nProgress. Apple’s anti-steering provisions are the number one thing I have been clamoring to be changed in the App Store rules. I think this should expand beyond just “reader” apps, but one step at a time.\nDo you hear that sound? That’s the sound of a significant amount of antitrust pressure being relieved from Apple.\n ★",

          "description": "Image: Arkane Studios/Bethesda Softworks\n    \n\n  \nArkane’s latest hotfix should make the PC frame rate a little smoother\n Deathloop is getting praise from just about everyone who plays it, but the PC version has a few problems. The worst of these is a camera stutter that happens just about every time players move their mouse. It’s an extremely frustrating issue, but one that Arkane hopes to have fixed with a new patch released on Tuesday. \nAccording to the patch notes that Arkane released with the new update, Tuesday’s hotfix aims to address issues that PC players have had where “mouse-based camera movements could result in the appearance of ‘stutter.’” That’s a lot of qualifiers to parse, but it seems like Arkane is saying that these aren’t actually frame rate stutters, they just have the “appearance” of them. Whatever the problem was, hopefully this patch makes it feel a little better.\nWhile the camera problem might be solved, it isn’t the only problem with Deathloop’s PC port. Arkane also explains in the patch notes that it’s looking into other problems as well. For instance, when you play Deathloop at an extremely high frame rate, the game also encounters a stutter. In our experience the game became nearly unplayable at 240 fps thanks to this issue, but it was fine when locked at 140 fps. In Tuesday’s patch notes, Arkane said that it thinks it’s identified the problem and will update players when it has more information. \nEven if there are still a few problems, the good news is Arkane seems to be working on them and trying to make the PC port as smooth as possible for players.",

Siren Shrines and Treasuries are arriving to the Sea of Thieves, and players will be able to either track them on their boat’s map, or look for the telltale shimmer of siren treasure on the surface of the water. The reward, of course, is tons of treasure.\nSome underwater enemies were introduced during the previous season, A Pirate’s Life, which included a crossover with Disney’s Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. They play a much bigger role in season 4. Siren shrines seem to have a lot in common with the above-water fort, except instead of skeletons, players have to work their way through waves of sirens, coral beasts, and other threats. They also have to solve puzzles to get to the final wave of treasure. \nLuckily, helpful mermaids will help pirates transport their loot to the surface in one go, so you don’t have to worry about the long trip back and forth with all of your coral-encrusted treasure. Coral-encrusted bottles have washed up on the shores, which give the player voyages into the Sunken Kingdom in order to find the Breath of the Sea. This mysterious potion sells and gives rep to the training companies.\nPirates can earn special coral-related cosmetics, like a ship set, scars, and even a curse by completing the new Sunken Kingdom. There’s also a Plunder Pass, which is free and offers 100 free levels of gear and currencies. An updated Plunder Pass grants some extra cosmetics for interested players.\nSea of Thieves’ new season is planned to launch on Sept. 23, and is a free addition to the game. The Sunken Kingdom content will remain in the game for players to explore, while the Plunder Pass is limited to the three-month duration of this season.",

The sequel was originally announced two decades ago.\nThe first Outcast game, an award-winning sci-fi adventure game developed by Appeal and published by Infogrames, was released on PC way back in 1999. The sequel, originally known as Outcast 2: The Lost Paradise, was announced the following year, but it was never completed due to financial issues.\nBut Outcast 2 looks like it’s actually going to happen this time, thanks to THQ Nordic, which is publishing the long-awaited sequel, once again developed by Appeal Studios. (The Belgian developer also released a modern remake of Outcast in 2017, titled Outcast - Second Contact, which Nacon published.) THQ Nordic says that its has reunited members of the original Outcast team, including composer Lennie Moore, to create Outcast 2.\n\n\nCutter Slade, the Navy SEAL protagonist of the original game, will return in Outcast 2 - A New Beginning. Cutter’s been resurrected “by the almighty Yods,” the game’s Steam page says, and will need to save the planet Adelpha from invading robot forces. Cutter’s jetpack will let him “jump, air-dash, glide, and quickly traverse” Outcast 2’s open world.\nTHQ Nordic and Appeal Studios describe Outcast 2 - A New Beginning as an open-world action-adventure game with non-linear story — players’ actions and decisions will change the narrative’s outcome. \nOutcast 2 is in development for PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X.

The game will be coming first to Windows PC and Mac OS, according to its announcement trailer. Creator Toby Fox announced the game as part of a livestream celebrating the sixth anniversary of Undertale. \nNo word on when the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 versions will be released, but if you played on a console and want to play on a computer this weekend, you’ll still be able to. Players with no save data will be able to start right at Chapter 2 once it’s released at 8 p.m. EDT on Sept. 17. “As long as you generally remember what happened story-wise, you’ll be fine,” the developers said in an FAQ. \nDELTARUNE Chapter 2 will release at 8PM ET on 9/17. \nThanks for waiting.https://t.co/dY8doW04bT pic.twitter.com/SJssTEF5gV\n— tobyfox (@tobyfox) September 16, 2021\n\n\n\nDeltarune takes place in the larger world of Undertale, and is intended for fans familiar with the first story. In it, you play as Kris, a child who one day accidentally fell into an alternate “Dark World” with their friend, Susie. Once there, the two are informed that they’re part of a team of three heroes destined to save it from eternal darkness. Deltarune isn’t a complete game; the only existing chapter of its story came out in 2018, and the second chapter will pick up after the events of the first.  \nIf you played Deltarune on PC or Mac, you will be able to carry your save file over. Just make sure you have rolled credits on it, and the completion data will generate in your game.\nAs for how much of the story this chapter will include, we won’t know The website confirms that there will be additional chapters to come, and that the team has only “completed Chapter 2 so far, so please be patient.”",

It’ll be using the extra time to work on several core features, using feedback from from a closed beta that took place in June and July.\nLead producer Arthur von Nagel didn’t characterize the news as a delay, however, saying Ubisoft San Francisco “didn’t set a hard date because we wanted the flexibility to react to feedback and to adjust release timelines to match.”\nVon Nagel did not say when the game would now launch. The studio will be working on feedback in four areas — song library; audio inputs and note detection; progression and education; UI, search, and content discoverability.\nWith regard to the song library, “we’re committed to offering over 5,000 songs” at launch, Von Nagel wrote. The closed beta purposefully had a selection of about 500 songs. He went into greater detail about the other three development areas in a message to the community.\n“We understand that this delay is disappointing,” Von Nagel wrote. “Every Rocksmith Plus player deserves to easily find the music you care about, to feel a sense of growth and mastery over your instrument, and to trust that the notes you play are heard fairly and accurately.”\nRocksmith Plus was announced in June during E3 2021. The guitar-teaching sim is scheduled to launch on Windows PC first, followed by launches on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. Following that, Rocksmith Plus will come to Android and iOS devices, too.\nRocksmith Plus will be a subscription-based service, with Ubisoft offering $14.99, $39.99, and $99.99 plans for monthly, three months, and annual subscriptions.",

          "description": "Image: CD Projekt Red\n    \n\n  \nMoist, even\n There have been a lot of questions about Cyberpunk 2077 since it launched in December, but none more strange that the one asked by the Polygon video team: Is Cyberpunk 2077 wet enough? We can now safely say that no, in fact, the game clearly launched without the requisite amount of moisture. The latest patch, numbered 1.31, should fix that.\nAs far as Cyberpunk patches go, this is a pretty small one. There were a few quest bugs that got squashed, but nothing game-breaking it sounds like. The PlayStation got a little “GPU optimization,” so we’ll have to see how that shakes out performance wise. But this update didn’t even come with a mock newscast to herald its arrival. From the description, it sounds like you might not even notice it. “Please note that the issues listed below did not affect all players” CD Projekt said in its preamble. \nBut then there’s this note:\nFixed an issue where roads after rain did not look wet, which was the result of ongoing work on the Wet Surfaces System. In 1.31 wet surfaces should look more detailed than they did even before the issue occurred.\n\n\n\nAs Polygon’s official wet correspondent pointed out in February, Night City should be damp,  its surfaces sodden, and even its smoothest features covered in rivulets of water because that’s how it was described by Mike Pondsmith and the team at R. Talsorian Games when the original tabletop game launched in the 1980s.\n“It always rains,” reads the official worldbook. “Every day should be grim, gloomy and overcast. The stars never come out. The sun never shines. There are no singing birds, laughing children. The last bird died in 2008 and the kids are grown in vats. The ozone layer is decayed, the greenhouse effect took over, the sky is full of hydrocarbons and the ocean full of sludge. Nice place.”\nSo, if anything, CD Projekt’s vision of the gritty urban metropolis is too gritty, and not nearly grimy enough. Today’s patch should fix that. You can find the full patch notes on the official website.",

Advertorials should be, after all. Players will also get the obligatory Danny Trejo cameo (con el machete, of course), and a Rambo mission series whose premise sounds like it kinda works? Rambo himself doesn’t drop into the game — it’s a Yaran superfan who, despite the near total cutoff of the island (vis-a-vis Cuba), has followed the 1980s action series and become obsessed with the character.\n\n\nThe three crossovers, coming post launch, led off a roadmap video Ubisoft posted on Friday. Players will also get, free from day one, weekly cooperative multiplayer operations — they’re “insurgencies” and “special ops.”\nOf course, this is a Ubisoft joint, so there’s a season pass with premium post-launch stuff, too. As mentioned before, you’ll be going inside the minds of Pagan Min, Vaas, and Joseph Seed to learn more about how those three got so messed up. Expect a lot of surrealism, and a lot of dying, but also a lot of loot?\nFar Cry 6 launches Oct. 7 for Amazon Luna, Google Stadia, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. The game was originally due in February, but was delayed as Ubisoft adjusted its COVID-19 development plans. Far Cry 6 stars Giancarlo Esposito as top bad guy Anton Castillo, and the player is Dani Rojas (not the Ted Lasso character, btw), who becomes a guerrilla army of one against the dictator.",

Unlike some events, however, there will be no replays available for Operation: Sky Fire. The event will take place in its own separate playlist which will go live 30 minutes before the event is set to begin — which is probably when you’ll want to be online, based on the server queues that have happened in the past. \nThis new event also comes with a few unique warnings from Epic. According to the developer’s post on the Fortnite website, players should make sure that all of their challenges are completed before the event begins, and that all of their Battle Stars have been redeemed — otherwise they’ll automatically be redeemed, starting with the earliest available unlocks. Players will also need to complete all of their Superman quests before the event if they want to unlock all of his cosmetic goodies. \nFortnite Chapter 2 season 8 is set to begin sometime after Operation: Sky Fire, but just how soon after, and what happens next, are things we’ll have to find out after the event.",

But it was Homer, beloved cat of protagonist Frey, that stole the hearts of viewers. The problem came when fans started wondering, “What’s going to happen to Homer while Frey is out kicking ass the entire game?”\nOn Twitter and YouTube, fans seemed excited about Forspoken, but concerned about Homer. “What happens to the cat?!?!” they asked. “I need closure for Homer...” one fan pleaded. “I 100% agree with everyone else, I can’t handle the guilt of letting my cat starve to death in my apartment while I play with dragons,” worried another.\nBut a new tweet from the Forspoken Twitter account has soothed fans.\nThis is a Homer appreciation post.  \nP.S.

More importantly, there’s a golden retriever wearing a space suit that talks. Forget about petting dogs. Talking dogs are the future, and the future is now.\nMarvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy was first officially revealed earlier this year at the all-virtual E3 event, but the existence of the game was leaked years earlier. At E3, Eidos-Montréal showcased the single-player, third-person adventure game that lets players take on the role of Star-Lord in a game that’s not a movie adaptation. It’s Eidos-Montréal’s new take on the franchise, with influence coming from existing lore. Though players will operate as Star-Lord, they’ll also be able to lead a team of other Guardians, like Rocket, Groot, Gamora, and Drax. Other familiar characters (and less familiar ones, like Lady Hellbender) will show up, too.\nMarvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.",

Gearbox will release Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X on March 25, 2022.\nIn addition to the series’ usual, wacky guns, players will also get their hands on crossbows, spell, and melee weapons — albeit with their own Borderlands twist.\nGearbox originally announced Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands at the Summer Games Fest kickoff stream earlier this year. The game will star Ashly Burch in the titular role — which she originally held back in Borderlands 2. Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands will also have an all-star supporting cast, with Andy Samberg as Captain Valentine, Wanda Sykes as Frette the robot, and Will Arnett as the evil Dragon Lord.\nTiny Tina’s Wonderlands will also feature a new character customization system, which will allow players to create a wholly unique protagonist that can fit into multiple class identities.

On Wednesday, Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics confirmed that Spider-Man will join Marvel’s Avengers alongside the game’s first raid.\nA year after launch, players will finally get a raid in Marvel’s Avengers. Players will battle Klaw, the primary villain of War for Wakanda, in a new and unique boss fight. Crystal Dynamics promised that heroes will battle new enemies in the raid and that this is an entirely new activity type — different from the super-hard Omega Level Threat that launched this Summer. \nImage: Crystal Dynamics/Square Enix\n      The new raid and Spider-Man are the highlights for the rest of 2021\n  \nSpider-Man, a character that’s exclusive to the PlayStation versions of Marvel’s Avengers, will also be out by the end of this year.

The developer revealed the new information, along with a few screenshots, on Tuesday, during Call of Duty: Vanguard’s multiplayer reveal stream.\nLike everything related to Vanguard, Warzone’s new map will be World War II-themed. The map is set in the Pacific, on an island with dense foliage and a few small towns and cities for players to fight in. Based on the early footage, it seems like the map will be a lot more tropical than Verdansk, and should feature more fighting in the jungles than the more urban settings of previous maps. \nThe new Warzone map will also run on the same engine as Call of Duty: Vanguard — which is essentially the same engine as Modern Warfare and the original version of Warzone’s Verdansk. According to Raven Software, this means that the game will easily integrate with Vanguard, including its weapons and gameplay style, which should be present on the new Pacific theater map when it’s released sometime later this fall. \nThe other major Warzone update that Raven Software offered on Tuesday was an update about the game’s new anti-cheat system. Unfortunately, that update didn’t really contain any new or meaningful details. But with Warzone cheating as bad as it’s been recently, it’s nice to hear that Raven is still hard at work on the new system. In a Call of Duty blog post on Tuesday, Raven called the system a “multifaceted new anti-cheat system for PC,” and explained that it’s still testing the system at the moment, but that it should be ready for Warzone’s Pacific map launch. \nImage: Raven Software/Activision\n  \n  \n        \n      Image: Raven Software/Activision\n  \n  \n        \n      Image: Raven Software/Activision\n  \n  \n        \n      Image: Raven Software/Activision",

For this batch, Riot collaborated with EDM artist Zedd to make a line up of musically infused weapon varieties. \nThe skin line will be called Spectrum, and Riot debuted the first look at each of the guns on Tuesday. The bundle includes skins for the Phantom, Guardian, Bulldog and Classic weapons, as well as for the knife melee weapon. Each skin has three variant colors (purple, red, and black) and a few upgrades, which players can unlock with Radianite Points. \nThe skins’ base variety is a sleek white with bright LEDs on the side, which change colors as you move, like the lights in a club. Spectrum skins also have unique animations for kills, a variety of unique firing sounds, and their round-finisher upgrade turns the map into a giant dance party. \nThis latest skin line isn’t the first time that Riot has collaborated with Zedd either. Back in 2016, the artist did the theme song for that year’s League of Legends World Championship — a track that remains a favorite of League fans today. While Riot has made plenty of exciting skins in the past, Spectrum seems to have some of the most complicated cosmetics the developer has ever made for Valorant. They’re definitely the most in-depth since last year’s Elderflame skins.\nThe Spectrum skin line is set to arrive in the Valorant in-game store on Wednesday, a day before the game’s new map, Fracture, will be released. The bundle, which includes all the skins, two gun buddies, a player card, and a spray, will cost a whopping 10,700 Valorant Points. For some perspective there, 11,000 Valorant Points costs $99.99.",

The next champion is Vex, the Gloomist, and she turns that trend on its head. This is one sad, emo little Yordle, and she’s got a big shadow friend to help her control the battlefield. Vex looks like a powerful mage who’s able to set up her abilities from range.\nRiot hasn’t revealed the exact explanation and numbers behind her ability kit, but we see her use her shadow for getting around the map a little faster and setting up an initiation as the enemy team goes to kill the dragon.\n\n\nWe knew Vex was on the way, thanks to her presence in the Sentinels of Light lore event. Vex helped out the Ruined King, Viego, and it looks like she still has a little bit of a crush on the gloomy wife guy. She also wants to hang out with Amumu, the sad mummy with no friends, so she’s not all bad. Her debut skin also looks much more colorful, for players who find the dark color palette to be unappealing.",

          "description": "Image: Riot Games\n    \n\n  \nAttack and defense are a little different on Fracture\n Valorant’s new map is its most unique so far. Fracture, which was officially announced on Wednesday, reverses attackers and defenders and makes both sides play a little differently than they’re used to. \nFracture is shaped like a giant letter “H.” There are two bombsites on the map with the connecting section of the “H” in-between. While you might expect the middle section to be the attacker’s spawn, it’s actually the other way around. On Fracture, defenders start in the middle, leaving the spawn area to defend the sites on either side. Meanwhile, the attackers can pinch in toward the defenders from either side. To help make transitioning from one area of the map to another a little easier, there are also ziplines that run from one side to the other that run below the map.\nImage: Riot Games\n  \nThis represents a pretty massive change to the regular format for Valorant maps, which generally place defenders in positions that encourage more passive play, allowing attackers to push into them. However, on this map, the spawns mean that defenders are often put in the position to make the first move. \n\n\nFracture also includes more lore than any previous Valorant map. The map features two mirror versions of reality, which is essentially the set up for the game’s larger story — and its explanation for why two versions of the same Agent might face off in a match. While we don’t know much about the world beyond its mirrored concept, there are interactable clues spread out around Fracture that should shed some new light on Valorant’s two realities. \nImage: Riot Games\n  \nFracture is set to come to Valorant as part of the patch 3.05 update, which players should expect to arrive next week as part of the game’s new Act update. Valorant Episode 3 Act 2 is scheduled to drop around Sept. 9. \nImage: Riot Games",

Players have a collection of Mercenary characters that they can pit against competing teams in both PvP and PvE modes. Blizzard will release Mercenaries on Oct. 12. \nPlayers will start with eight Mercenary characters and the main hub, a Village. The Village lets players manage their characters and base, then send their squad off on a procedurally generated Bounty run or a competitive match against another person. At launch, there will be over 50 Mercenaries, including the Lich King, Sylvanas, and Diablo (from the Diablo games, obviously). Completing the Mercenaries prologue also grants players a mouse mount in World of Warcraft.\nThere are three kinds of Mercenaries: Fighter, Caster, and Protector, which exist in a rock-paper-scissors system. Once players figure out their squad of three characters, they head into combat, which is turn-based. Each side picks their team’s actions, and then the round plays out. The format feels similar to Hearthstone’s Battlegrounds mode, with rounds split between decision making and action.\nHearthstone publisher Activision Blizzard faces wide-ranging allegations that it maintains a toxic workplace environment that is particularly hostile to women, pays them less, and subjects them to sexual harassment, and that perpetrators are not meaningfully punished, according to a lawsuit filed by California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing in July. You can read more about the allegations against Activision Blizzard in Polygon’s explainer.

In an interview for Twitch’s The Weekly show, Destiny 2 game director Joe Blackburn confirmed that players won’t see a new powerset in The Witch Queen expansion.

We have one in development, you’re gonna see it eventually, but we really want to make sure we get it right.”\nBlackburn went on to speak about the Light subclass rework, which will use the Stasis system added to the game in Beyond Light. The creative director talked up the new reworks for these Light subclasses, suggesting that longtime players will have a lot more tools and combinations to play with. \nIt’s currently unclear what the fifth subclass type will be in Destiny 2 — or when players will get their hands on it.

The collection bundles Monster Rancher (1997) and Monster Rancher 2 (1999), and will launch Dec. 9 on Nintendo Switch, Windows PC via Steam, and iOS, Koei Tecmo announced Thursday.\nIn the Monster Rancher games, players raise monsters and train them to compete against other creatures in combat and tournaments, just like in Pokémon. The original Monster Rancher launched with a fun gimmick where players could use physical CDs to unlock monsters in the game, with each CD corresponding to a monster. \nMost people don’t use CDs anymore, but the developers found a way to rework the feature into their modern version of the game. In Monster Rancher 1 & 2 DX, you’ll be able to search a database to find each monster’s desired CD and generate a monster from its data. \n\n\nThe re-release will include new content that wasn’t in the original Western release, like additional save slots, Freeze slots, and Monster Hall of Fame slots. The newer version will bring a few other improvements to gameplay, as well. Players will now be able to use a memo feature while raising monsters, view rankings from random battles, and use a high-speed mode to play through the game faster. \nThe Monster Rancher reboots are but a few of the many Pokémon-likes that have been announced or released in recent years. There’s Temtem, a hardcore MMO version of Pokémon released in 2020, and Palword, a game that takes the concept of raising cute monsters and turns it into a brutal survival game, which is due sometime in 2022. Or also, you could just play one of the many actual Pokémon games that are slated to be released in the next few months, like Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl or Pokémon Legends: Arceus.",

Adam Isgreen, creative director at World’s Edge, offered a (very) deep dive into the fan-favorite, highly memed trebuchet during Xbox’s Gamescom stream, as a way to teach players about medieval history.\n\n\nAge of Empires 4 will include 28 unlockable Hands on History videos, each of which was “filmed on location with experts around the world.” In the case of ye olde trebuchet, mechanical engineer Dr. Shini Somara explained how the don’t-call-it-a-catapult works at Warwick Castle in England during a three-minute-long segment shown at Tuesday’s livestream.\nWorld’s Edge and Relic showed off the Age of Empires 4 trebuchet in action in-game last week, in a trailer that offers a short but satisfying burst of projectile lobbing and castle sieging.\n\n\nThey’ve also shown off other weapons of war coming to Age of Empires 4, including the Nest of Bees, which I only learned about today and was crestfallen to discover does not shoot actual bees.\nAge of Empires 4 launches on Oct. 28, on Windows PC via Steam and the Windows Store. It will be available for Xbox Game Pass for PC on launch day.",

          "description": "Image: Bungie\n    \n\n  \nDestiny will finally get a weapon crafting system as well\n Players finally know what to expect with Destiny 2: The Witch Queen, the game’s fourth expansion, thanks to Bungie’s Destiny Showcase on Tuesday. The studio revealed a host of details around the major update, including the addition of weapon crafting and a new weapon type: the Glaive.\nThe Glaive is a kind of spear or polearm in Destiny 2, with a long, curved blade on the end. It’s the series second bladed melee weapon, after Bungie added swords in The Taken King, but it’s the first melee weapon that keeps Guardians in first-person. Glaives, like swords,  will have melee combos, but unlike swords, they’re energy weapons and don’t sit in the heavy slot. But players can also launch projectiles with them.\nThe Witch Queen also introduces Destiny 2’s first real weapon crafting system, although Bungie has fiddled with the idea in past seasons like with The Menagerie’s Chalice of Opulence mechanic. Bungie says this new mechanic will let players “craft the perfect roll,” and combine unique mods with advanced stats. It seems like it should allow players to find the weapons they’re looking for more easily.\nThe studio isn’t revealing much about the system just yet, but it’s the only way players can unlock the new Glaive. Guardians will be able to craft weapons from The Witch Queen at launch, with even more weapons coming later in 2022.\nThe Witch Queen expansion takes players to meet Savathun — the titular Witch Queen and sister of Oryx from Destiny’s The Taken King expansion. Players will adventure into her Throneworld to discover how Savathun and her brood of Hive began wielding their own Ghosts and the Light powers that come with them.",

          "description": "For the next two weeks, L’Arc de Triomphe in Paris will be wrapped, an installation that realizes a project begun by the late husband and wife team Christo and Jeanne-Claude in 1961.\nL’Arc de Triomphe, Wrapped, a temporary artwork for Paris, is on view for 16 days from Saturday, September 18 to Sunday, October 3, 2021. The project has been realized in partnership with the Centre des Monuments Nationaux and in coordination with the City of Paris. It also receives the support of the Centre Pompidou. The Arc de Triomphe is wrapped in 25,000 square meters of recyclable polypropylene fabric in silvery blue, and with 3,000 meters of red rope.\nIn 1961, three years after they met in Paris, Christo and Jeanne-Claude began creating works of art in public spaces. One of their projects was to wrap a public building. When he arrived in Paris, Christo rented a small room near the Arc de Triomphe and had been attracted by the monument ever since. In 1962, he made a photomontage of the Arc de Triomphe wrapped, seen from the Avenue Foch and, in 1988, a collage. 60 years later, the project will finally be concretized.\n\n\nJeanne-Claude died in 2009 and Christo followed in 2020, so the project was completed by their team according to their wishes. I would have liked to have seen this in person…The Gates in NYC were wonderful.\nTags: art   Christo   Paris",

But what about the colors? The moon is gray, of course, but not *perfectly* gray. Some areas have a subtle blue tint, and others have a more orange tint. By teasing out those subtle colors, I can reveal the mineral composition of the moon! Blues denote titanium presence, while orange shows iron and feldspar present in the regolith. You can also see how impacts paint the surface with fresh color in the ejecta as they churn up material.\n\n\nA print is available, but only for a very limited time (~6 more hours as of pub time).\nTags: Andrew McCarthy   astronomy   Moon   photography   space",

          "description": "If you’re talking about the origins of rock & roll, Sister Rosetta Tharpe has to be included in those conversations. Her early fusion of gospel, the blues, and the electric guitar (as on 1944’s Strange Things Happening Every Day, a contender for the first rock & roll record) had a huge influence on men like Little Richard, Chuck Berry, and Elvis Presley, who ended up winning much of the credit for this innovation. This 60-minute BBC documentary from 2011 is a good place to start learning about Tharpe — part 1 is embedded above and here are parts two, three, and four.\nI found this via Ted Mills at Open Culture, who writes:\nAs the doc makes clear, Tharpe had a rebellious streak, didn’t do what she was told, and pushed boundaries in a very segregated America. She invited the all-white Jordanaires to tour with her, surprising house managers and booking agents alike. And she carried on a love affair and creative partnership with fellow gospel singer Marie Knight for decades, very much on the down low.\nSo perhaps this is the reason Tharpe has not been on our collective radar — we’ve been slow to admit that rock guitar was created by a queer black woman devoted to the Lord.\n\n\nAnd if you want to see the whole clip of Tharpe performing Didn’t It Rain from the opening scene of the documentary, there’s really not a better way to spend eight minutes (bc you’ll probably want to watch it twice):\n\nDamn.\nTags: music   Rosetta Tharpe   video",

He wrote a remarkable little book back in 2019 called “The Psychology of Pandemics.” Its premise is that pandemics are “not simply events in which some harmful microbe ‘goes viral,’” but rather are mass psychological phenomena about the behaviors, attitudes and emotions of people.\nThe book came out pre-COVID and yet predicts every trend and trope we…",

          "description": "Dr. Alan Braid, a practicing OB/GYN in the state of Texas for 45 years, explains why he provided medical care in the form of an abortion to a woman in violation of the state’s absurd and dangerous new law.\nA new Texas law, known as S.B. 8, virtually banned any abortion beyond about the sixth week of pregnancy. It shut down about 80 percent of the abortion services we provide. Anyone who suspects I have violated the new law can sue me for at least $10,000. They could also sue anybody who helps a person obtain an abortion past the new limit, including, apparently, the driver who brings a patient to my clinic.\nFor me, it is 1972 all over again.\nAnd that is why, on the morning of Sept. 6, I provided an abortion to a woman who, though still in her first trimester, was beyond the state’s new limit. I acted because I had a duty of care to this patient, as I do for all patients, and because she has a fundamental right to receive this care.\nI fully understood that there could be legal consequences — but I wanted to make sure that Texas didn’t get away with its bid to prevent this blatantly unconstitutional law from being tested.\n\n\nBraid concluded his piece: “I believe abortion is an essential part of health care.” Absolutely.\nTags: abortion   Alan Braid   medicine   politics   Texas",

Homeless by choice, he offers his services to small farms in exchange for food or a place to stay (though half his calories come from his sheeps’ milk).\nWith a tiny metal cart home pulled by his sheep, he has a bed, a refrigerator/evaporative cooler, a shower (he uses a pesticide sprayer to pump up the water pressure), power (solar panel), sun oven, a mailbox stove for heat, bicycle tire wheels and a corrugated plastic roof.\nFletcher makes cheese and butter from his sheep milk and forages for seeds, fruits, vegetables and herbs.\n\n\nI heard about this from @hova414, who teases it better than I can:\nAn “anti-consumer” gives one of the most impressive product demos I’ve ever seen; a nonstop highlights reel of ingenious off-grid inventions. Come for the wearable teepee, stay for the solar banana bread.\n\n\nMy jaw legit dropped open at the solar bread part — that solar oven! It’s absolutely fascinating to listen to him explain how he efficiently uses space, public resources, and a limited amount of tightly curated technology products to live a happy and healthy life, an outcome many of us have been told by capitalism is impossible. I also enjoyed his distinction between being a selfish prepper and a community prepper:\nBy the way I’m a prepper, but I’m not like a normal prepper as in… I call it selfish prepping. I’m a community prepper. I’m not so interested in trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic situation if everyone around me is suffering. So I’m trying to figure out how to bring up the community so that they can all thrive.\n\n\nYou can learn more about Fletcher’s life and how he lives it on his website and check out his YouTube videos for more clever DIY tips.\nTags: Aaron Fletcher   video",

This video is like a private cooking class with a very thoughtful & knowledgable host — and it made me incredibly hungry. A good pairing might be Saxelby’s recent book, The New Rules of Cheese.\nBut….. at the first mention of the word “fridge”, I could not help but think of this classic interview with French marketing consultant Clotaire Rapaille: In America, the Cheese Is Dead.\nFor example, if I know that in America the cheese is dead, which means is pasteurized, which means legally dead and scientifically dead, and we don’t want any cheese that is alive, then I have to put that up front. I have to say this cheese is safe, is pasteurized, is wrapped up in plastic. I know that plastic is a body bag. You can put it in the fridge. I know the fridge is the morgue; that’s where you put the dead bodies. And so once you know that, this is the way you market cheese in America.\n\n\n Tags: Anne Saxelby   cheese   food   how to   video",

His long-time producer Lydia Tenaglia saw this too…she cold-called him after reading the book and pitched him on doing a TV show called A Cook’s Tour, where the intrepid Bourdain would travel to different locations around the world to experience the food culture there.\nI met him at a point in his life where he had never really traveled before. He had written a book, Kitchen Confidential, and I had read somewhere that he was going to try to write a follow-up book called A Cook’…",

          "description": "When it was built in the 1920s in Turin, Italy, the Fiat factory was designed with a racetrack on the top of the building, both for car testing purposes and for racing.\nThe factory’s best-known symbol is the test track, which is a superb piece of design modeling, and construction that occupies the whole roof surface of the workshops. Two 443 meters straights, joined by parabolic bends, form a continuous track for testing the cars.\nOriginally, as soon as the cars left the assembly lines they could flow directly upward to the test track through the snail-shaped ramps completing the whole processing cycle inside the factory. Moreover, these spiraling ramps inside the building allowed the cars to be driven back down and into showrooms.\n\n\nThe track was a little over 1/2 mile long.

          "description": "For her project Topography of Tears, Rose-Lynn Fisher used a scanning electron microscope to photograph the crystalized patterns of dried human tears. Part of why the images all look different is because tears are made up of varying chemicals depending on why they’re made.\nScientifically, tears are divided into three different types, based on their origin. Both tears of grief and joy are psychic tears, triggered by extreme emotions, whether positive or negative. Basal tears are released continuously in tiny quantities (on average, 0.75 to 1.1 grams over a 24-hour period) to keep the cornea lubricated. Reflex tears are secreted in response to an irritant, like dust, onion vapors or tear gas.\nAll tears contain a variety of biological substances (including oils, antibodies and enzymes) suspended in salt water, but as Fisher saw, tears from each of the different categories include distinct molecules as well. Emotional tears, for instance, have been found to contain protein-based hormones including the neurotransmitter leucine enkephalin, a natural painkiller that is released when the body is under stress.\n\n\nThis project is also available in book form.

He was seventeen years old, and when his visa expired he became undocumented. He lived with an older brother and took classes day and night and through the summer in order to finish high school in two years. “I became a man the moment I set foot on U.S. soil, full of responsibility,” he told me. He started playing the violin a few years later, with teachers at the Harlem School of the Arts. He was soon practicing several hours a day and working long shifts at Pizza Hut. He felt that he was too old to train as a professional, but his practice had become central to his life: “Music was the escape, music was the goal. Music was what made me achieve great things,” he said. “The violin gives me a discipline where I feel I can conquer anything.”\n\n\n Tags: art   Haiti   Lydia Cornett   music   NYC   video   Yves Deshommes",

Williams Asked Me Before Every Season of ‘The Wire’:\nAnd from that moment forward, his questions about our drama and its purposes were those of someone sharing the whole of the journey. It became something of a ritual with us: To begin every season that followed, Michael K. Williams would walk into the writers’ office and sit on the couch.\n“So,” he would ask, “what are we going to say this year?”\nHe gave us an astounding gift — an act of faith from a magnificent actor who could have played his hand very differently. Television usually chases its audience — if they love them some Omar, you feed them more Omar. If they can’t stop looking at Stringer, you write more Stringer. Never mind story and theme.\nInstead, Mike bent his beautiful mind to a task that even the best writers and show runners often avoid. He thought about the whole story, the whole of the work.\nPerhaps more than any in that talented cast, I came to trust Mike to speak publicly to our drama and its purposes, to take personal pride in all that we were trying, however improbably, to build. He became increasingly political as the show aged, and in interviews took to addressing societal and political issues, his arguments ranging well beyond Omar’s arc.\n“I started to realize that, oh, this is not about me,” Williams once told an interviewer, looking back. “It had everything to do with … just great tapestry, this great narrative of social issues … things that are wrong in our country.”\n\n\nSee also tributes from Wendell Pierce and other actors & filmmakers who worked with Williams.\nTags: David Simon   Michael K.

Maya Cade writes about why she created this archive.\nThe films collected on Black Film Archive have something significant to say about the Black experience; speak to Black audiences; and/or have a Black star, writer, producer, or director. This criterion for selection is as broad and inclusive as possible, allowing the site to cover the widest range of what a Black film can be.\nThe films listed here should be considered in conversation with each other, as visions of Black being on film across time. They express what only film can: social, anthropological, and aesthetic looks at the changing face of Black expression (or white attitudes about Black expression, which are inescapable given the whiteness of decision-makers in the film industry). \nFilms, by their very nature, require a connection between creator and audience. This relationship provides a common thread that is understood through conventional and lived knowledge to form thought and to consider. Not every filmmaker is speaking directly to Blackness or Black people or has the intention to. Some films listed carry a Black face to get their message across. But presented here, these films offer a full look into the Black experience, inferred or real, on-screen.\n\n\nWhat a great open resource — exactly what the internet is for.

          "description": "Documentaries about mushrooms like Fantastic Fungi are interesting but it turns out that short documentaries about how mushroom documentaries are made are fascinating as well. For this short video, Wired talked to Louie Schwartzberg about how mushroom time lapses are filmed. I don’t know why I assumed they filmed these outside…of course they are done indoors to help control lighting, weather, and other factors (like rogue wildlife). And after decades of working on nature films, Schwartzberg has integrated his process deeply into his life:\nI realized I’ve turned it into a spiritual practice. It actually literally gets me up in the morning because as soon as I’m out of bed, I’m thinking ooh, “I wonder what the flower did last night? Is it still in frame? Is it in focus?”\nI have to imagine what the framing and the composition is going to look like tomorrow, or two days from now, or a week from now. That is a transformational experience because you have to put your mind into the mindset and the intention of the flower or the fungi, thinking where it’s going to grow, how big will it get. And if you’re right, boy, it’s a rush. If you’re wrong, it means you just gotta do it all over again.\n\n\nThis was surprisingly philosophical in parts.\nTags: Fantastic Fungi   video",

          "description": "Because of humans, most of the world’s oyster reefs have disappeared over the last 200 years. Now, some groups around the world are trying to put some of them back. In addition to providing water filtration and habitats for other animals, offshore oyster reefs can help slow long-term erosion by acting as living breakwater structures that partially deflect waves during storm surges.\nIn the last century, 85% of the world’s oyster reefs have vanished. And we’re only recently beginning to understand what that’s cost us: While they don’t look incredibly appealing from the shore, oysters are vital to bays and waterways around the world. A single oyster can filter up to 50 gallons of water every day. And over time, oysters form incredible reef structures that double as habitats for various species of fish, crabs, and other animals. In their absence, our coastlines have suffered.\nNow, several projects from New York to the Gulf of Mexico and Bangladesh are aiming to bring the oysters back. Because not only are oysters vital ecosystems; they can also protect us from the rising oceans by acting as breakwaters, deflecting waves before they hit the shore. It won’t stop the seas from rising — but embracing living shorelines could help protect us from what’s to come.\n\n\n(via the kid should see this)\nTags: food   global warming   oysters   video",

          "description": "As his name suggests, Jamaican street musician Brushy One String plays a one-string guitar and, under that constraint, makes some truly beautiful music. Josh Jones wrote about Brushy for Open Culture:\nWhen Jamaican musician Andrew Chin, better known as Brushy One String first told friends about his vision — “a dream in which he was told to play the one-string guitar” — they responded with mockery — all but one, who “insisted it was fate,” writes Playing for Change, “and that he had to make that dream come true.” So Brushy set out to do just that, playing on street corners and in the market, “in a big broad hat and sunglasses,” he says. The music came to him naturally. He is no ordinary street musician, however, and his one-string guitar is not a gimmick. Brushy is a talented singer-songwriter, with a powerful voice and a musical sensibility that transcends his bare-bones minimalism.\n\n\nIn addition to his NPR Tiny Desk Concert above, this video of Brushy performing Chicken in The Corn on his one-string has been viewed over 50 million times.\nSee also Gasper Nali and His Homemade [One-String] Bass Guitar.

Evan Puschak’s Nerdwriter is a particular favorite guiding light and in his latest video, he talks about Agnès Varda’s Cléo from 5 to 7, a film I now want to watch as soon as possible. A synopsis via Wikipedia:\nCléo from 5 to 7 follows a pop singer through two extraordinary hours in which she awaits the results of a recent biopsy. The film is superficially about a woman coming to terms with her mortality, which is a common auteurist trait for Varda. On a deeper level, Cléo from 5 to 7 confronts the traditionally objectified woman by giving Cléo her own vision. She cannot be constructed through the gaze of others, which is often represented through a motif of reflections and Cléo’s ability to strip her body of “to-be-looked-at-ness” attributes (such as clothing or wigs). Stylistically, Cléo from 5 to 7 mixes documentary and fiction, as had La Pointe Courte. The film represents diegetic action said to occur between 5 and 7 p.m., although its run-time is 89 minutes.\n\n\nI’ve added Cléo from 5 to 7 to my HBO Max queue but you can also find it on Kanopy (accessible with a library card) and The Criterion Channel.\nTags: Agnes Varda   Cleo from 5 to 7   Evan Puschak   film school   movies   video",

Gorman read Herman Melville’s masterpiece last year and made these maps & graphics to help him make sense of it.\nI read Moby-Dick in April 2020. For weeks afterward, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I started making maps and diagrams as a way to figure it out.\nMoby-Dick is infamous for its digressions. Throughout the book, the narrator disrupts the plot with contemplations, calculations, and categorizations. He ruminates on the White Whale, and the ocean, and human psychology, and the night sky, and how it all relates back to the mystery of the unknown. His narration feels like a twisting-turning struggle to explain everything.\nReading Moby-Dick actually made me feel like that-like I’d mentally absorbed its spin-cycle style. I developed a case of “Kaleidoscope Brain.” The maps I was making were obsessive and encyclopedic. They were newer and weirder and they digressed beyond straightforward geography.\n\n\nThe book is available as a free download on Gorman’s Patreon — support his efforts if you find them valuable!\nAbove, from top to bottom: the letters of the alphabet in order of their appearance in the book, the constellation Cetus (aka “The Whale”), every color in the book.\nTags: books   design   Herman Melville   infoviz   Moby Dick   Peter Gorman   remix",

From a NY Times piece on the mosaic:\nThe Soundsuits have always been an amalgam of cultural references, Cave explained: the concepts of shamans and masquerade, obscuring the race, gender and class of the wearer and forging a new identity. They contain ties to Africa, the Caribbean and Haiti.\n“It’s very important that you can make references, you can connect to something,” Cave said. “In one of the mosaics in the corridor, there’s a sneaker. So that brings it to this urban, right-now time.”\nFrom beneath a pink-and-black cloak of raffia, carefully crafted out of glass shards, pokes a contemporary sneaker in shades of salmon, white and maroon. Cave likes the play that’s happening here: The form is sometimes figurative, sometimes abstract. “Sometimes it’s identifiable and sometimes it’s not,” he said. “But that’s the beauty of it all.”\n\n\n(thx, caroline)\n\nNo, not that Nick Cave.↩\n\nTags: art   Nick Cave   NYC   subway",

With the much more contagious Delta variant in play and an increasing number of breakthrough infections, the efficacy of these vaccines that we thought were amazing maybe aren’t? (Or maybe we just need to readjust our expectations?) But in terms of what these vaccines were specifically developed for — reducing & preventing severe disease and death — they are still very much doing their job. Just take a look at this graph from a White House Covid-19 press briefing yesterday:\n\nEven with Delta endemic in the country, the vaccines are providing extraordinary protection against infections severe enough to land folks in the hospital. In a recent CDC study of infections and hospitalizations in Los Angeles County, they report that on July 25, the hospitalization rate of unvaccinated people was 29.2 times that of fully vaccinated persons. 29 times the protection is astounding for a medical intervention. These vaccines work, we’re lucky to have them, and we need to get as many people worldwide as we can vaccinated as quickly as we can. Period.\nTags: Covid-19   infoviz   medicine   science   USA   vaccines",

There was even a book version in 2011 and Helen Rosner wrote about the site for Saveur.\nTo create an image, he simply places half a sandwich on the glass of his Epson V700 scanner. “There’s not a lot of trickery,” says Chonko, who will release a book based on the site in November, with Powerhouse Books. “I try to stay true to the heart and soul of the sandwich. That’s a lofty way to think about it. But then I eat it for lunch.”\n\n\nThe site has stopped publishing new scans, but it’s still good, still delicious. And is a hot dog a scanwich? Apparently so.\nTags: food",

          "description": "Only 34 paintings by Dutch master Johannes Vermeer, art history’s foremost painter of Side Views of People Doing Things Near Windows,  have been known to survive to the present day, so when one of them is restored, it’s a big deal. The Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister in Dresden shared the first image of the completed restoration of Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window — and you might notice a pretty big change on the wall behind the girl.\nThe painting has been in the museum’s collection for more than 250 years and the hidden Cupid had been known about since an x-ray in 1979 and infrared reflectography in 2009. It had been assumed that the artist himself had altered the composition by covering over the painting of Cupid.\nBut when a major restoration project began in May 2017, conservators discovered that the paint on the wall in the background of the painting, covering the naked Cupid, had in fact been added by another person. When layers of varnish from the 19th century began to be removed from the painting, the conservators discovered that the “solubility properties” of the paint in the central section of the wall were different to those elsewhere in the painting.\nFollowing further investigations, including tests in an archaeometry laboratory, it was discovered that layers of binding agent and a layer of dirt existed between the image of Cupid and the overpainting. The conservators concluded that several decades would have passed between the completion of one layer and the addition of the next and therefore concluded that Vermeer could not have painted over the Cupid himself.\n\n\nThere is a certain aesthetic amenity to the bare wall in the altered version but maaaybe the original Cupid lends the painting some figurative meaning?\nTags: art   Johannes Vermeer",

The New Yorker’s Atul Gawande investigates.\nLife expectancy tends to track national income closely. Costa Rica has emerged as an exception. Searching a newer section of the cemetery that afternoon, I found only one grave for a child. Across all age cohorts, the country’s increase in health has far outpaced its increase in wealth. Although Costa Rica’s per-capita income is a sixth that of the United States — and its per-capita health-care costs are a fraction of ours — life expectancy there is approaching eighty-one years. In the United States, life expectancy peaked at just under seventy-nine years, in 2014, and has declin…",

Unintuitively, sometimes native tech can actually be the cheapest way to achieve a certain goal, and sometimes cross-platform technologies actually lead to better products, even for very well-funded companies. So what is a useful way to think about the tradeoff?\nOver the last decade I’ve talked to people at hundreds of companies about how they’re developing and supporting apps, helping them evaluate and plan native and cross-platform app work. While there are a lot of factors that go into this technology decision, there’s one that I think is particularly illuminating.\nMore and more apps written with web tech (such as Electron) are showing up on the Mac desktop everyday. I understand why, but I don't have to like it.",

          "description": "Photo by Joshua Sarner/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n    \n\n  \nSuddenly, everything is happening. \n Just like that, training camp is upon us! The Flyers are set to be back on the ice starting on Thursday. We’ll see them broken up into three groups for regular on-ice sessions for the first three days of camp, and then they’ll add a couple of scrimmages on top of those sessions on Sunday and Monday, ahead of Tuesday’s preseason kickoff against the Islanders. \nYou can find the full schedule for here, and the full roster for camp can be found here. \nThe Flyers have also announced the following injury updates:\nKevin Hayes (abdominal surgery on 9/21 - out 6-8 weeks)\nSamuel Morin (right knee surgery to have loose bodies removed on 9/10 - out 6-8 weeks)\nWade Allison (right ankle sprain - out indefinitely)\nZayde Wisdom (shoulder surgery - out indefinitely)\nCooper Zech (upper body - out 6-8 weeks)\nNot all of this is surprising: we knew that Wisdom would be out for a while, and there had been rumors about Morin’s status kicking around for the last little bit here. But there are a few takeaways. The ankle injury for Allison is still not great, but considering how ugly the play he was injured on looked, and the knee issues he’s had in the past, an ankle injury feels like a bit of a bullet dodged, all things considered. \nThe Hayes news is the big surprise, and that certainly complicates things. The Flyers’ center situation heading into camp already looked to be a bit up in the air, and a lot was going to depend on those battles in camp to solidify those positions, and now they seem to be even more wide open. With Hayes out (and to a degree, Allison as well) this certainly opens up the door for some prospects like Morgan Frost and Tanner Laczynski, who have been impressing in development and rookie camps, to push hard for a spot, and reasonably grab one. \nThings are getting really interesting around here, and while it feels like we say this every year, this camp is going to be one to keep an eye on.",

What does he bring to the table?\n Seven years after being drafted 17th overall by the Philadelphia Flyers in the 2014 NHL entry draft, Travis Sanheim has become a polarizing figure amongst the fanbase.\nThe reasons are obvious enough as Sanheim hasn’t exactly cemented himself as a star in the league while seemingly possessing a lot of the tools necessary to do so. From the outside looking in, that’s seemingly caused a large portion of the fanbase to tire of Sanheim over the last few seasons. He’s not a physical player despite being a 6’3” defender, and that seems to be brought up a lot by his detractors, but he’s probably a lot better than he gets credit for. \nIt’s likely not all t…",

This year, the mayor’s seat is wide open, after incumbent mayor Steve Schewel declined to run for re-election to a third term. Wards I, II, and III also feature races, with incumbent council members seeking re-election in Wards I and II. A primary election for mayor and seats for Wards I and II take place October 5, with the top two vote getters in each race advancing to the general election on November 2. Early voting in Durham’s municipal primary begins next week for these three seats, and we will make endorsements in all three races. The Ward III seat drew only two candidates, so they will automatically advance to the general election ballot. We will not endorse in this race as candidate AJ Williams is the son of our staff writer, Thomasi McDonald, who covers Durham. Read questionnaires from some of the candidates below and check back this Wednesday for our endorsements!",

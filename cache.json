          "description": "With the macOS Monterey and iPadOS 15 release candidates that were seeded to developers today, Apple has eliminated the option to use the Color Tab Bar with the separate tab design in Safari.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nA tab bar with color in Safari 15\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to have a color tab bar that blends in with the background color of a website, you need to toggle on the Compact Tab Bar, which is the tab bar design that Apple introduced with macOS Monterey and iPadOS 15 updates. \"Show Color in Compact Tab Bar\" is an option that can be enabled in both iPadOS 15.1 and ‌macOS Monterey‌.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the iPad, the option is available in the Safari section of the Settings app. Scroll down to the bottom to find it and toggle it on, and then the color tab interface will show up when the ‌iPad‌ is using the Compact Tab Bar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Mac, the Show Color in Compact Tab Bar option can be toggled on in the Safari preferences under Advanced and then Accessibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple today updated macOS Monterey to change the tabs back to the original tab design, essentially undoing many of the design changes that were introduced in Safari with the initial release of the Monterey beta. As of now, the standard Big Sur design is the default, and the Compact Tab Bar is an optional change that can be toggled on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that Apple has made this change as the color tab bar interface was designed for the new look in Monterey and not the older Big Sur design that Apple has now reverted to.\nRelated Roundup: macOS Monterey\nTag: Safari\nRelated Forum: macOS Monterey\nThis article, \"macOS Monterey and iPadOS 15.1 Release Candidates Limit Safari Color Tab Bar Option to Compact View\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The newly announced 2021 MacBook Pro models include an SD card slot and an HDMI port alongside three Thunderbolt ports. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs noted in Apple's technical specifications for the new machine, the HDMI port is unfortunately not top of the line -- it is an HDMI 2.0 port instead of an HDMI 2.1 port. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe HDMI 2.0 port supports a single 4K display with a resolution of up to 60Hz. HDMI 2.1 technology would have allowed the port to run a 4K display with a 120Hz refresh rate. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's curious that Apple did not include HDMI 2.1 in the MacBook Pro models because the Apple TV 4K that was released earlier this year does have an HDMI 2.1 port. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nHDMI port is only HDMI 2.0, exactly why I’d much rather have had another T4 port, what a waste. pic.twitter.com/zzUXwfGoO8\n— Paul Haddad (@tapbot_paul) October 18, 2021\n \n\r\n\r\nWith the Thunderbolt 4 ports, the M1 Pro MacBook Pro models overall support up to two external displays with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz.

          "description": "Back in late September, mentions of a \"High Power\" mode were spotted in macOS Monterey code, and it appears Apple is still working on the feature. Battery code in the macOS Monterey release candidate mentions a \"High Power\" option, and this time, includes additional detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Your Mac will optimize performance to better support resource-intensive tasks. This may result in louder fan noise,\" reads the code. The mention was discovered by MacRumors contributor Steve Moser.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no High Power mode that appears to be present in the ‌macOS Monterey‌ beta on an M1 Mac, so it's possible that this is something that's exclusive to the ‌M1‌ Pro and ‌M1‌ Max MacBook Pro machines that are launching next week. Such a feature was not mentioned on stage today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's also possible that this is a forthcoming feature that's not quite ready to launch and that's why we're not yet seeing it as a consumer-facing option in ‌macOS Monterey‌.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‌macOS Monterey‌ is set to be released to the public on Monday, October 25, and the ‌M1‌ Pro and ‌M1‌ Max MacBook Pro models will begin arriving to customers the next day, so we won't have long to wait to find out if there's a hidden High Power mode.\nRelated Roundup: macOS Monterey\nRelated Forum: macOS Monterey\nThis article, \"Mentions of High Power Mode Possibly for New MacBook Pros Again Found in macOS Monterey\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

When users are not in full-screen macOS apps, the notch remains, and the macOS Menu Bar has been made thicker to accommodate the notch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe inclusion of a notch allowed Apple to make the bezels on the new 14-and 16-inch MacBook Pros considerably thinner compared to the previous 13-inch and 16-inch models.

Apple does not plan to offer the MagSafe Charging Case on its own, so there will be no upgrade option. The standard AirPods Pro wireless charging case can be used with MagSafe anyway because it's a Qi-based wireless charging protocol.

The ‌HomePod mini‌ features a significantly smaller design than the original ‌HomePod‌, but continues to feature the same ‌Siri‌ experience, powered by ‌Apple Music‌ and third-party services. Unlike the original ‌HomePod‌ selling for $299, the ‌HomePod mini‌ is priced at $99. The ‌HomePod mini‌ recently became available in more countries, including Austria, Ireland, and New Zealand. \nRelated Roundup: HomePod\nTag: October 2021 Apple Event\nBuyer's Guide: HomePod (Don't Buy)\nRelated Forum: HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home & Auto Technology\nThis article, \"Apple Removes References to Original HomePod From Website, Months After Discontinuation\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "In an update to the macOS Monterey features page on its website, Apple has indicated that the Universal Control feature previewed at WWDC 2021 will be available later this fall, which likely means it will be enabled in a future software update.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's not a surprise that Universal Control has been delayed beyond the initial release of macOS Monterey, which will be available Monday, October 25, as the feature was still not enabled in the latest macOS Monterey beta. Apple did add a \"beta\" label next to hidden Universal Control settings in System Preferences, suggesting that the feature will be considered a public beta when it launches, just like iCloud Private Relay on iOS 15.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUniversal Control will allow for a single mouse, trackpad, and keyboard to be used across multiple Macs and/or iPads side by side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther new macOS Monterey features include AirPlay to Mac, a redesigned Safari browser, a Shortcuts app, spatial audio in FaceTime, and more. There is also a new SharePlay feature that will let Apple users watch TV, listen to music, and share their screens with one another, but like Universal Control, this feature is coming later this fall.\nRelated Roundup: macOS Monterey\nRelated Forum: macOS Monterey\nThis article, \"Apple Says Universal Control Coming to macOS Monterey Later This Fall\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Earlier this week, a Reddit user claimed that the next MacBook Pro will not feature Face ID despite having a notch, with a Touch ID sensor expected to remain above the keyboard for authentication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe photo is blurry and it's unclear if it's authentic, so some skepticism is warranted here. If the photo proves to be real, however, it suggests that the next MacBook Pro models could feature very thin bezels around the display.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the macOS Monterey beta, MacRumors discovered potential display resolutions of 3024x1964 and 3456x2234 for the rumored 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models. When subtracting 74 pixels from the height of both, the resulting 3024x1890 and 3456x2160 resolutions work out to an aspect ratio of 16:10. All of Apple's current MacBooks feature a 16:10 aspect ratio, leading to speculation that the extra 74 pixels could be for a notch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple is hosting a virtual event on Monday at 10 a.m. Pacific Time, with rumors widely suggesting the event will be focused on redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with a faster version of the M1 chip and brighter mini-LED displays.

The new AirPods are rumored to feature a similar design as the AirPods Pro, but without Active Noise Cancellation, and they could have improved sound quality and some other new features.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe third-generation AirPods have already been manufactured and are ready to launch, according to Wedbush's supply chain checks, which increases the likelihood that they will be announced during the Apple Event next week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEarlier this week, an account on Chinese social media platform Weibo known as @PandaIsBald also claimed that third-generation AirPods will be announced at the Apple Event next week. Last month, the same account accurately revealed that Apple would announce the ninth-generation iPad at its September event.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis would be the first update to the standard AirPods since the second-generation AirPods were released in March 2019. The second-generation AirPods are priced at $159 with a wired charging case and at $199 with a wireless charging case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn update to the AirPods Pro is not expected until next year.\nRelated Roundup: AirPods\nTag: October 2021 Apple Event\nBuyer's Guide: AirPods (Don't Buy)\nRelated Forum: AirPods\nThis article, \"AirPods 3 Ready to Launch and Likely to Be Announced at Apple Event Next Week, Analyst Says\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

This means that in 2021, the latest flagship iPhone model costs $437 more to buy in each of the 38 countries it's available in than it used to.\nWhile the price increase comes alongside more advanced technology and increases in production costs, the increase also comes as a result of inflation and Apple having to sometimes increase prices to counter economic growth. \r\n\r\nHowever, many countries have experienced inflation and growth in purchasing power in the years between, and our research shows that Apple have risen iPhone prices 26% higher than local inflation rates. This means that local affordability for a flagship iPhone costs people around the world $154 more in real terms than the first models they could purchase.\nAs part of its research, Self has created an interactive map that highlights the changes in ‌iPhone‌ prices in real-world terms as a percentage of GDP over the last 14 years in more than 30 countries around the world. According to that map, the United Arab Emirates has witnessed the largest increase in the price of the ‌iPhone‌, with the latest model costing more than double what it did when it originally launched.\nThis article, \"Over The Last 14 Years, iPhone Prices Have Gone Up More Than 80%\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

This module is not advertised on Apple's website and is likely for Apple's internal use only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nThe hidden diagnostic port on an Apple Watch Series 3\n\r\n\r\nMacRumors has since confirmed with The Verge's Dieter Bohn and others that the Apple Watch Series 7 lacks a hidden diagnostic port that was located in the bottom band slot on all previous Apple Watch models. Apple used the port for diagnostic purposes when servicing an Apple Watch, such as to restore watchOS over a wired connection with a special tool.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lack of a diagnostic port on Apple Watch Series 7 models likely explains the addition of the 60.5GHz wireless data transfer module. FCC filings indicated that the module is only activated when the Apple Watch is placed on a proprietary magnetic dock with a corresponding 60.5GHz module, so it sounds like Apple might use this dock to perform diagnostics or restore watchOS wirelessly on Series 7 models.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's also worth noting that Series 7 models feature IP6X-rated dust resistance, so perhaps the diagnostic port's removal helped with that to some degree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple Watch Series 7 models will begin arriving to customers and launch in stores this Friday, October 15.

The news caused a drop in Apple's stock, leading some analysts to be concerned about the performance of the ‌iPhone 13‌ and Apple's ability to keep up with demand. Now, however, the company's suppliers are pushing back. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA preview of a paywalled DigiTimes report set to be published tomorrow states, \"component suppliers for Apple's new iPhones have claimed no cutback in orders thus far this year.\" While the news about a cutback in orders may be incorrect, according to suppliers, there is little doubt regarding production challenges for Apple's products. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe iPhone 13 Pro and ‌‌iPhone 13 Pro‌‌ Max, for example, continue to list weeks or even as long as a month for delivery dates. The Apple Watch Series 7, going on sale this Friday, is also experiencing delays in shipments, with some high-end models leading into early December.

If you're running the beta on your device, or just for future reference when iOS/iPadOS 15.1 is officially released, here's how to disable them.\r\n\r\n\nLaunch Settings on your ‌iPhone‌ or ‌iPad‌.\n\r\n\r\nTap Notifications.\n\r\n\r\nUnder \"Notification Style,\" select Apple TV Keyboard.\n\r\n\r\nToggle off the switch next to Allow Notifications.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you're running iOS 15.1 and you don't see the ‌Apple TV‌ Keyboard listed in the Notifications menu, you may need to connect to your ‌Apple TV‌ and select a text field to activate a keyboard input notification, before it will show up there.\nRelated Roundups: Apple TV, iOS 15, iPadOS 15\nBuyer's Guide: Apple TV (Buy Now)\nRelated Forums: Apple TV and Home Theater, iOS 15\nThis article, \"How to Disable Annoying Apple TV Keyboard Notifications in iOS 15.1 and iPadOS 15.1\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

After connecting the hub to the Mac, users must open the HyperDisplay app that appears on the desktop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that on both of the hubs, one HDMI port supports 60Hz and the other is limited to 30Hz, which may be a dealbreaker for some users.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 3-in-1 hub is priced at $129.99 in the United States and is available on Hyper's website, while the 10-in-1 hub runs for $199.99.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Hyper.

After the complimentary coverage expires, customers may purchase AppleCare+ as a one-time purchase or on a monthly basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's unclear why Apple implemented this change, but it could relate to strong warranty protections under Australian Consumer Law.

Alluding to the RCS protocol, Lockheimer goes on to state there is a \"Really Clear Solution\" and that he is offering an \"open invitation to the folks who can make this right,\" with the \"folks\" in question being a reference to Apple.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGoogle has been rolling out RCS for the past several years, and in July, all three major carriers in the U.S. pledged to adopt RCS, which, compared to SMS, offers support for higher quality photos and videos, audio messages, improved security, and better group chats. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith RCS, Android to Android messaging communication will become fully end-to-end encrypted.

          "description": "The iPhone 14 won't rely entirely on a hole-punch cutout to house the TrueDepth camera system, possibly meaning Apple may retain the notch alongside a hole-punch design, according to a new rumor from Weibo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has reported that for at least the high-end 2022 iPhone models, Apple will use a hole-punch design, similar to those of some flagship Android smartphones. Following Kuo's report, Apple leaker Jon Prosser shared renders of what he claims to be the design of the ‌iPhone 14‌. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEven if the ‌iPhone 14‌ introduces a hole-punch design, it will be hard for Apple to abandon the notch altogether, according to a now-deleted post on Weibo from @PandaIsBald. The account, which accurately predicted that the ninth-generation iPad would be announced at the September Apple event, claimed that it is \"unlikely\" that Apple will replace the notch entirely with a hole-punch cutout, and instead, the ‌iPhone 14‌ may continue to feature a notch but with a smaller footprint. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro, Apple did make the notch smaller in width but slightly taller. Apple did this by shrinking the component sizes of the TrueDepth camera system and reengineering the internals. Apple this year also moved the earpiece to the top of the bezel, freeing up space in the notch. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReporting on a hole-punch design for next year, Apple analyst ‌Ming-Chi Kuo‌ did not provide details on how Apple will house Face ID on the high-end ‌iPhone 14‌ models if it uses a hole-punch design. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nToday's rumor from Weibo claims that Touch ID will not be making an appearance under the display next year, meaning Face ID may continue to be the only biometric authentication option available to ‌iPhone 14‌ users. \nRelated Roundup: iPhone 14\nThis article, \"iPhone 14 Unlikely to Rely on Hole-Punch Design Entirely and May Keep Notch, No Under-Screen Touch ID, Leaker Claims\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Johnson wondered whether Google had decided to disable AMP in ‌iOS 15‌ due to the prevalence of Safari extensions that feature AMP-blocking features.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nIt's a bug specific to iOS 15 that we're working on. We expect it will be resolved soon.\n— Danny Sullivan (@dannysullivan) October 6, 2021\n \n\r\n\r\nThat Google search results do not include AMP links in the Safari browser on ‌iOS 15‌ is a bug, according to Google's public search liaison Danny Sullivan. In a tweet, Sullivan said that Google is working on a fix and that the issue should be resolved soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor those unfamiliar with AMP, it stands for \"Accelerated Mobile Pages\" and it is a feature that's designed to make webpages load faster on mobile devices. AMP pages are cached, allowing them to be presented to users more quickly, but it's something that is not always popular with users because some website features are disabled when AMP is used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Google does re-implement AMP links, iOS 15 Safari extensions like Amplosion are available to redirect AMP links to standard webpages.\nRelated Roundups: iOS 15, iPadOS 15\nTags: Google, Safari\nRelated Forum: iOS 15\nThis article, \"Google to Fix Bug That Disables Safari AMP Search Results on iOS 15 Devices\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "iPhone 13 Pro models feature an upgraded Ultra Wide camera with autofocus that enables macro photography, allowing users to take close-up photos of flowers, insects, and other objects that are as close as 2cm to the camera lens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple's Macro Mode is limited to iPhone 13 Pro models, but those with older iPhones can now get in on the action, as Halide today announced that it has updated its popular third-party camera app with its own Macro Mode, with no accessories required. The feature is available on all iPhones with a Neural Engine, including the iPhone 8 and newer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHalide said its Macro Mode first checks which one of your iPhone's camera lenses can focus the closest and switches to it. Then, the feature provides ultra-precise focus control down to the sub-millimeter to ensure the photo looks sharp. Finally, an AI-based feature called Neural Macro further enhances close-up details of the photo once shot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nHalide's sample photo shot with its Macro Mode on iPhone 12 Pro\n\r\n\r\nIf you already have an iPhone 13 Pro model, Halide said its Macro Mode essentially stacks on top of Apple's Macro Mode, resulting in \"staggeringly close, microscope-like shots that are even more highly magnified.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo turn on Macro Mode in the Halide app, first tap the AF button to get into manual focus, and then tap the flower button. The feature is available as a free update for all existing users, with version 2.5 of the app rolling out on the App Store today. For new users, the Halide app is priced at $2.99 per month or $11.99 per year, or $49.99 as a one-time purchase.  \nTag: Halide\nThis article, \"Halide's New Macro Mode Lets You Take Close-Up Photos Without an iPhone 13 Pro\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

On Android devices, multiple payment services can offer contactless payments using the NFC chip, but on the ‌iPhone‌, no rival services are allowed to leverage the NFC hardware.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Commission's preliminary concerns also reportedly include Apple's terms and conditions on how ‌Apple Pay‌ should be used in merchants' apps and on websites. Concerns may have been raised by ‌Apple Pay‌'s wide reach and better user experience on the ‌iPhone‌ compared to other services, and accelerated by the growth of contactless payments during the global health crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe EU competition enforcer is now believed to be preparing a statement of objections to charge Apple with anticompetitive conduct, which is expected to be sent to the company next year. The antitrust charge could put Apple at risk of a large fine and force it to open the NFC chip to rival payment systems in Europe. Similar investigations have also been opened in Australia.\nRelated Roundup: Apple Pay\nTags: European Union, European Commission, NFC, Europe\nRelated Forum: Apple Music, Apple Pay/Card, iCloud, Fitness+\nThis article, \"EU Plans to Hit Apple With Antitrust Charges Over Apple Pay\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

There are eight colors to choose from, and the line below the tab can be customized to be between 1 and 7 pixels wide. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Zhenyi notes, the extension works best with the \"Separate\" tab layout selected and \"Show color in tab bar\" disabled in the Tab section of Safari's Preferences. Zhenyi also cautions that ActiveTab will not work reliably if you have so many tabs in a window that the tab bar becomes scrollable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActiveTab is available for $1.99 on the Mac App Store, with no in-app purchases, no ads, and no tracking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(H/T MacStories.)\nTag: Safari\nThis article, \"Safari 15 Extension for Mac Helps You Tell Which Tab Is Active\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "A number of banks are currently pressuring Visa to make changes to the way it processes some payments made via Apple Pay, moves that would reduce the fees the banks pay to Apple for certain transactions, reports The Wall Street Journal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the heart of the issue are automatic recurring payments like memberships and streaming services. Visa is aiming to change the way it issues tokens for ‌Apple Pay‌ cards such that Apple would only receive a transaction fee on an initial subscription payment and not on subsequent transactions.\nWhen Apple introduced Apple Pay in 2014, the iPhone had already clobbered music players, cameras and GPS systems. Banks and card networks worried it also would displace card payments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBanks agreed to pay Apple 0.15% of each purchase made by their credit cardholders. (They pay a separate fee on debit-card transactions.) Those fees account for most of the revenue that Apple makes from its digital wallet, according to people familiar with the matter.\nAside from the fee arrangement, Apple garnered several other concessions from credit card issuers as it rolled out ‌Apple Pay‌, and in exchange, Apple agreed not to launch its own credit card network to go up against Visa and Mastercard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the launch of Apple Card in partnership with Goldman Sachs, Apple has become more of a direct competitor to other banks, and some bank executives have reportedly been angered by Apple's move and are seeking ways to reduce the payments they make to Apple.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple has unsurprisingly informed Visa that it objects to the proposed change that would reduce the fees it receives on recurring transactions, so it remains to be seen whether Visa will follow through on its plans, which are scheduled to go into effect next year.\nRelated Roundup: Apple Pay\nTags: wsj.com, Visa\nRelated Forum: Apple Music, Apple Pay/Card, iCloud, Fitness+\nThis article, \"Banks Pressuring Visa to Cut Back on Apple Pay Fees\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Safari 15's controversial new design on the Mac has led to complaints about the way the browser indicates which tab is active.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs illustrated by Daring Fireball's John Gruber, there was never any ambiguity about which tab is active in previous versions of Safari, as an active tab is shown with lighter shading that matches the browser's toolbar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Safari 15, however, tabs have a new button-like design with a rounder and more defined appearance. Apple has also inverted its shading of tabs, with an active tab now having darker shading and inactive tabs having lighter shading. The change has annoyed Gruber and other users, as evidenced by this Reddit thread with nearly 1,000 upvotes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The design is counterintuitive,\" wrote Gruber. \"What sense does it make that no matter your settings, the active tab is rendered with less contrast between the tab title and the background than background tabs? The active tab should be the one that pops.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a Safari 15 window with two tabs open, especially from the same website, Gruber said determining which tab is active is basically a guessing game. Gruber acknowledged that it is easier to discern the active tab when more than two tabs are open, but he said the confusion with exactly two tabs should have been reason enough to scrap the design change.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I can't tell you how many times I closed the tab that I needed because of this,\" one Reddit user expressed in frustration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for users who do not like the new design, Apple has not made any changes to the shading of tabs in either the Safari 15.1 beta or the latest version of the experimental Safari Technology Preview browser.\nTag: Safari\nThis article, \"Safari 15 Users Say New Tab Design is Counterintuitive\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "After its first event of the fall, Apple is on track to hold a Mac focused event within the next month, where it will debut brand new MacBook Pros with a faster \"M1X\" Apple silicon chip, an updated design, and improved display technology, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple last year held its Mac event in November, but in the past, it has held Mac events in October. Till now, there's been some unknown about whether Apple will stick with its November or October timeframe for this year. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his latest Power On newsletter, Gurman says the company is poised to announce M1X powered MacBook Pros within the next month, noting that \"Apple typically does its major new Mac introductions in October. So stay tuned.\" In the paywalled section of the newsletter, Gurman also reiterated what we can expect performance-wise from the new machines. \r\n\r\nThe Apple M1X chip, the likely name for a more graphics-intense and professional-focused M1 chip, is indeed still on tap for 2021. We'll likely see it show up first in a new range of MacBook Pros in the next month and a higher-end Mac mini at some point. The M1X has been developed in two variations: both with 10 CPU cores (eight high-performance and two high-efficiency) and either 16 or 32 graphics cores.\nPrevious report suggests that alongside the new MacBook Pros, Apple may also announce a redesigned Mac mini. Apple last month announced the iPhone 13, Apple Watch Series 7, a new generation iPad, and the sixth-generation iPad mini, and besides new Macs, the company is also rumored to be releasing third-generation AirPods before the end of this year.  \nRelated Roundups: MacBook Pro 13\", MacBook Pro 16\"\nTags: Mark Gurman, 14-Inch MacBook Pro\nBuyer's Guide: 13\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy), 16\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)\nRelated Forum: MacBook Pro\nThis article, \"New MacBook Pros Likely to Launch at Apple Event This Month, Says Gurman\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Amid rumors that the Apple Watch Series 7 could go on sale in just a matter of weeks, new images shared with MacRumors allegedly show the new Apple Watch in the wild, giving us our first real-world look at Apple's latest watch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe images were initially posted on a Facebook group for Apple Watch enthusiasts, but it has been taken down since its posting. The poster of the photos claimed that they are working for a carrier who was testing the Series 7 before it officially goes on sale \"later this fall.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe've so far only seen the Series 7 in Apple's marketing and promotional materials, and the company has yet to announce a date for when it will be available for purchase. The images shared today offer us our first hands-on look at the Series 7 with its larger and more expansive display. Despite rumors, the Series 7 does not feature flat-edges but instead \"more rounded and softer corners,\" which allows the display to curve slightly over the sides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe larger display is one of just a few design changes for the Series 7 compared to the previous generation. The Series 7 features an improved IP6X rating for dust and water resistance but internally maintains the same CPU as the Apple Watch Series 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile there certainly could be more internal changes for the Series 7, we'll have to wait until we get our hands on the watch itself to learn about them.

          "description": "Apple has canceled its plans to release an updated iPad Air with an OLED display next year due to concerns around quality and costs, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said today in an investor note obtained by MacRumors. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn March, Kuo reported that Apple had an ‌iPad Air‌ with an OLED display in the pipeline for next year. Today, Kuo has revised his prediction, saying that will not be the case since Apple has canceled those plans due to costs and performance not meeting the company's expectations. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKuo had previously stated that the 11-inch iPad Pro would be receiving a mini-LED display next year, and Kuo today doubled down on that claim by saying it will be the \"focus of [the] iPad line in 2022.\" Currently, only the 12.9-inch iPad Pro includes the newer mini-LED technology. One reason Kuo states that Apple had canceled its OLED ‌iPad Air‌ is that it may have been detrimental to the sales of the forthcoming 11-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ with a mini-LED display. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Apple plans to stick with an LCD display for the ‌iPad Air‌, Kuo says the company continues to research and develop newer display technologies for the ‌iPad‌ line. A report last week suggested that Apple and Samsung had abandoned their joint plans to develop an OLED display for a forthcoming updated 10.9-inch ‌iPad Air‌. \nRelated Roundup: iPad Air \nTag: Ming-Chi Kuo\nBuyer's Guide: iPad Air (Neutral)\nRelated Forum: iPad\nThis article, \"Kuo: Apple Cancels Plans to Release iPad Air With OLED Display in 2022, Plans to Stick With LCD Technology\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "iOS 15 adoption has reached an estimated 19.3% since the software update was released September 20, according to mobile analytics company Mixpanel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMixpanel measures iOS adoption based on visits to websites and apps that use its mobile analytics SDKs, so the data is not official. Apple has yet to share iOS 15 adoption stats, having last reported an 85% adoption rate for iOS 14 back in June.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\niOS 15 adoption appears to remain slower than iOS 14 adoption so far, and there are likely several reasons for that, including Apple providing iOS 14 users with the option to continue receiving important security updates, several iOS 15 features being delayed, and iOS 15 suffering from a handful of early bugs that still need to be fixed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, Apple said an issue preventing some iPhone 13 users from using the Unlock with Apple Watch feature will be fixed in an upcoming software update. The feature is designed to let you unlock your iPhone while wearing a mask, but some users have encountered an \"Unable to Communicate with Apple Watch\" error message.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere's another iOS 15 bug where performing an iCloud Backup can result in photos saved from an iMessage conversation that is later deleted to disappear from the Photos app, intermittent touchscreen issues on iPhone 13 models, and other problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple is currently beta testing iOS 15.1, which includes a fix for the Unlock with Apple Watch bug at a minimum, but there is no timeframe for the software update's release. It's quite possible that Apple will opt to release a smaller update such as iOS 15.0.1 to more quickly address some of the bugs and security vulnerabilities that have surfaced.\nRelated Roundups: iOS 15, iPadOS 15\nTag: Mixpanel\nRelated Forum: iOS 15\nThis article, \"iOS 15 Suffering From Several Bugs as Adoption Rises to Nearly 20%\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

At the time of writing, the Podcasts app, which has faced a flurry of criticism, has a 2 out of 5-star rating out of 156 reviews, with other Apple apps varying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPresently, no Apple app has a perfect five-star rating, with even the company's built-in Stocks app struggling to reach a 4 out of 5 grade. Notes has earned just 3.6 out of 5, while even Maps, which has received more attention from Apple over the years, has only a 3 out of 5 ratings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy opening up its apps to ratings and reviews, Apple and its teams are now better able to receive more direct feedback for individual apps on ‌‌iPhone‌‌ and iPad. In light of recent ‌App Store‌ litigation, this move also nixes a potential criticism from Apple's detractors, who could have previously argued that by withholding ratings and reviews for pre-installed apps, Apple was being anti-competitive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple's pre-installed apps, such as Mail, Podcasts, and Maps, don't receive regular ‌App Store‌ feature updates as other apps do; instead, their major updates are bundled with significant iOS releases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple refines and tweaks all of its apps with each minor update for iOS and iPadOS, but significant changes, such as the ones that are likely to be requested through ratings and reviews, are not expected to come sporadically throughout the year, but instead, users will have to wait for the next major iOS release to see if their wishes have come true.\nTag: App Store\nThis article, \"Apple Now Lets Customers Rate and Review Pre-Installed Apps on the App Store\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

For comparison, the iPhone 12 Pro Max is capable of charging at up to around 21W to 22W speeds with an equivalent power adapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's worth noting that the iPhone 13 Pro Max does not sustain peak 27W power for the entire charging cycle due to heat considerations, but the device should still charge slightly faster than the iPhone 12 Pro Max overall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nIt's unclear if the smaller iPhone 13 Pro is also capable of charging at up to 27W speeds — we've asked ChargerLAB and we'll update this story if we hear back.

Facebook says it is testing the ability for Instagram Reels content creators to share their Reels to the Facebook audience, but doing so is entirely in a creator's control. Reels on Facebook can consist of effects, text, music, and more. Facebook's concept of Reels is wholly inspired by TikTok and follows its lead in featuring short, \"entertaining,\" and trend-making videos. \nWith the ability to create reels and have their Instagram reels suggested to people on Facebook, creators — whether they’re just starting out or already have a large following — will have more ways to express themselves, grow their communities and reach new audiences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReels on Facebook can consist of music, audio, effects, and more. You can find them in News Feed or in Groups, and when viewing a reel on Facebook, you can easily follow the creator directly from the video, like and comment on it, or share it with friends.\nFacebook also today announced it would be offering a new bonus program for content creators in hopes of spurring-up more Reels content on its platform.

          "description": "Apple and Google have been asked to provide compliance plans for a newly amended law in South Korea that bars both tech giants from forcing developers to using their in-app purchase payment system for their respective app distribution platforms, Reuters reports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn August, South Korea passed an amendment to an existing law that bans Apple and Google from mandating developers to use their own proprietary in-app purchasing system. Apple's in-app purchasing system gives the company a 15 to 30% commission for all purchases made and has been a hot topic for Apple and the discussion around the App Store for some time. Under the new law in South Korea, which is yet to go into effect, Apple and Google will be required to allow developers to use third-party payment methods within their app. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple has in recent weeks made some concessions to its ‌App Store‌ policy, most notably pivoting to allow developers to add links in their apps to external websites where purchases can be made. Those concessions come short of the mandate created by South Korea, which permits developers to add third-party payment methods directly within their app. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple has continued to call its in-app purchasing system the most trusted and safest way for customers to make purchases. Still, in light of recent decisions in its lawsuit against Epic Games, the Cupertino tech giant is being forced to rethink its model. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple operates the ‌App Store‌ under a single set of policies worldwide, and while the law passed in South Korea pertains to South Korean users, it will undoubtedly play a domino effect across the globe. With the mid-October deadline now set in South Korea for Apple and Google, we'll likely see how this decision could have repercussions around the world for Apple users soon. \nTags: App Store, South Korea\nThis article, \"Apple and Google Given Mid-October Deadline in South Korea for Filing Plans to Allow Outside Payment Systems in Apps\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Likewise, there's no way of knowing if the feature would be available on all Macs or be exclusive to certain models, such as the upcoming 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models rumored to drop this fall.

The post implies that customers should possibly consider replacing some of Apple's default iOS apps, such as Photos, Safari, Calendar, Reminders, and even Phone, with Google's equivalent of those apps, including Google ‌Photos‌, Google Chrome, Google Calendar, Google Tasks, and Google Voice, respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGoogle continued to encourage customers to utilize the wide variety of ‌widgets‌ its iOS apps offer. Google said that if the right Google ‌widgets‌ are placed on the home screen, users will \"never even have to leave\" their home screens to stay caught up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the blog post, users can also use \"Smart Stacks\" to stack different Google ‌widgets‌ on top of each other, allowing iOS to determine which widget is most relevant to show at any one time. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, Google recommends that users replace Safari with Google Chrome as the default iOS browser, allowing all system-wide links and Spotlight web suggestions to open in Chrome. Google closed by saying it hopes ‌iPhone 13‌ users, who just started receiving their new iPhones last week, will consider bringing \"the best of Google\" to their device instead of just simply purchasing an Android smartphone or device.\nTags: Google, Android\nThis article, \"Google Basically Wants Your iPhone 13 Home Screen to Look Like Android\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The Beats Flex are a follow-up to the BeatsX, and feature an in-ear design with a wire between the left and right earbuds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiven their low price, the Beats Flex may have been more susceptible to cost pressures than some other Apple products. At $20 more expensive, the Beats Flex are still a very affordable option to get into the Apple headphone ecosystem, but it's not quite as impressive a deal as before. They come in Black, Flame Blue, Yuzu Yellow, and Smoke Gray, and offer much of the same seamless connectivity functionality available with Apple's more expensive Beats options.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAuto-play/pause is included, and the Beats Flex last for up to 12 hours without needing to be recharged.

Those users are advised to update for a possible patch and improved security. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Spotify is being held as the main culprit for the excessive drainage, it could also be a bug in ‌iOS 15‌ for some users. ‌iOS 15‌ has been littered with multiple bugs, including one limiting Apple Watch functionality with the just-released iPhone 13, issues with Apple Music, and other bugs that Apple has promised fixes for.

          "description": "When Apple announced the new iPhone 13 series, it also introduced several new camera features, including Photographic Styles for photos and Cinematic mode for shooting video. In this article, we take a look at what Photographic Styles are and how to use them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhotographic Styles consist of a series of subtle filter-like adjustments that you can enable before you've taken any photos, allowing you to bring a stylistic effect to your shots beforehand that won't affect the skin tone of your subjects. These styles come in four presets: Vibrant, Rich Contrast, Warm, and Cool. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVibrant captures the shot in bright, vivid, yet natural-looking colors, while Rich Contrast adds a more dramatic look that makes shadows darker and increases color and contrast. Warm adds a summery golden…",

Apple Store pickup is the best option for customers who did not pre-order an iPhone 13 model, as placing an order through Apple's online store today could result in a lengthy wait time of 4-6 weeks for delivery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo check if an iPhone 13 model is available for Apple Store pickup, head to the iPhone 13 or iPhone 13 Pro order page, configure the iPhone as you would like it, and look for a \"Pickup\" option towards the bottom of the page. A link below the \"Pickup\" option leads to an iPhone Availability tool, which displays iPhone 13 models available for pickup at nearby Apple Stores based on the zip code or postal code that you enter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKey features across all four iPhone 13 models include a faster A15 Bionic chip, camera improvements, longer battery life, and a smaller notch. The two Pro models also feature a ProMotion display with a variable refresh rate up to 120Hz, up to 1TB of storage, and additional camera features like Night mode portraits and ProRes video recording.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the United States, starting prices are the same as they were for the iPhone 12 lineup, including $699 for the iPhone 13 mini, $799 for the iPhone 13, $999 for the iPhone 13 Pro, and $1,099 for the iPhone 13 Pro Max.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sixth-generation iPad mini and ninth-generation iPad are also available for same-day pickup at select Apple Stores starting today.\nRelated Roundups: iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro\nBuyer's Guide: iPhone 13 (Buy Now), iPhone 13 Pro (Buy Now)\nRelated Forum: iPhone\nThis article, \"iPhone 13 Launch Day Underway With Same-Day Pickup Available at Select Apple Stores\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Apple has yet to share iOS 15 adoption stats, having last reported an 85% adoption rate for iOS 14 back in June.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEarlier this year, Apple announced that iPhone users who remain on iOS 14 now have the option to continue receiving important security updates, so this change is likely contributing to iOS 15's lower adoption rate seen by Mixpanel so far.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdating to iOS 15?

Most variants are available in 4-6 weeks, with 3-4 weeks being the earliest delivery estimate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs with every Apple product launch, it is possible that lengthy delivery estimates are a result of low supply rather than high demand. However, the ‌iPad mini‌ was arguably the standout product in Apple's event, thanks to its 8.3-inch display and chassis redesign in the vein of the iPad Air. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new ‌iPad mini‌ is also the only iPad with Apple's latest A15 Bionic chip, and like the iPad Pro, includes a 12-megapixel Ultra Wide front camera enabling Center Stage, so there's good reason for ‌iPad mini‌ fans to be excited again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReview embargos for the ‌iPad mini 6‌ lift later today, so be sure to check back here on MacRumors for a full reviews roundup.\nRelated Roundup: iPad mini\nBuyer's Guide: iPad Mini (Buy Now)\nRelated Forum: iPad\nThis article, \"Most iPad Mini 6 Shipping Estimates Now Extend into November\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "In iOS 15 as well as Safari 15 for macOS Big Sur and macOS Catalina, Apple introduced some Safari interface design changes that haven't been universally welcomed. Fortunately, Apple has made some of these changes optional, such as the ability to disable tab bar coloring. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nTab bar coloring on (left) versus coloring off (right) in dark mode\n\r\n\r\nTab bar coloring, or website tinting, happens when the color of Safari's interface changes around the tabs, bookmark, and navigation button areas to match the color of the website you're viewing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe idea behind tinting is that it allows the browser interface to fade into the background and create a more immersive experience. However, the effect doesn't always look great, especially if you have several windows arranged on your desktop. Happily, Apple chose to include an option to turn it off.\r\n\r\n\nLaunch Safari, then select Safari -> Preferences... from the menu bar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSelect the Tabs panel.\n\r\n\r\nUncheck the box next to Show color in tab bar.\r\n\r\n\nIf you're using Safari in ‌iOS 15‌, you can find the same option in Settings -> Safari. Under the \"Tabs\" section, turn off the switch next to Allow Website Tinting. On iPadOS 15, this option is called Show Color in Tab Bar, just like in Safari 15 for macOS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn previous versions of iOS, Apple included a \"Show Color in Tab Bar\" accessibility setting, which basically had the same effect as the new \"Allow Website Tinting\" toggle. The fact that Apple made the option more prominent suggests user aversion to tinting is more common than previously thought. \nRelated Roundups: macOS Big Sur, macOS Monterey\nTag: Safari\nRelated Forums: macOS Catalina, macOS Big Sur, macOS Monterey\nThis article, \"How to Turn Off Tab Bar Coloring / Tinting in Safari\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Alongside the iOS 15.1 beta, Apple has also introduced a HomePod 15.1 beta that brings Lossless and Dolby Atmos Spatial Audio support to the ‌HomePod‌ and the HomePod mini.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ‌HomePod‌ beta software is invite only and is not provided to developers for testing purposes, but 9to5Mac was able to confirm that Lossless and Spatial Audio support are included in the beta.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple added Dolby Atmos with Spatial Audio and Lossless support to iOS and Mac devices in May, but promised that the feature would be coming to the ‌HomePod‌ and ‌HomePod mini‌ at a later time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLossless Audio and Dolby Atmos can be enabled through the Home app. Open up Home Settings, tap on your profile, and then under Media, tap on Apple Music. From there, toggle on Lossless Audio and Dolby Atmos. Note that these options appear in the iOS 15.1 beta, but the ‌HomePod‌ 15.1 beta seems to be needed to actually use the features on the ‌HomePod‌.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf all goes well, these features should launch with the ‌HomePod‌ 15.1 software that is set to be released alongside iOS 15.1. Since the iOS 15.1 was just provided to developers today, we likely have several weeks of testing to go.\nRelated Roundups: HomePod, HomePod mini\nBuyer's Guide: HomePod (Don't Buy), HomePod Mini (Buy Now)\nRelated Forum: HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home & Auto Technology\nThis article, \"HomePod 15.1 Beta Adds Lossless Audio and Dolby Atmos Support\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The new updates reintroduce features like SharePlay, and below, we have a list of what's new.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSharePlay\n\r\n\r\nSharePlay is enabled in the iOS 15.1, iPadOS 15.1, and tvOS 15.1 betas to allow Apple to further work out bugs to get the feature ready to launch. Apple decided to pull SharePlay from the ‌iOS 15‌ launch because it was not properly functioning and was still riddled with issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAvailable in FaceTime, SharePlay is designed to let users call up their friends and family and then watch TV, watch movies, and listen to music together using neat features like shared playlists and TV show syncing for all users. SharePlay also allows for screen sharing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf testing goes well, SharePlay could see an official launch in iOS 15.1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnounce Calls\n\r\n\r\nIn the Settings for the Phone app, there's a new icon for the \"Announce Calls\" setting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLossless Audio for HomePod\n\r\n\r\nThe HomePod 15.1 beta that accompanies the iOS 15.1 beta adds Lossless Audio and Dolby Atmos with Spatial Audio support to the HomePod and HomePod mini.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVaccine Cards in Wallet\n\r\n\r\nIn ‌iOS 15‌, verifiable health records can be downloaded and stored in the Health app, and this includes COVID-19 vaccination records and health results. In iOS 15.1, vaccination records are able to be added to the Wallet app so a vaccine card can be provided to businesses, restaurants, venues, and more where vaccines are required for entry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSee our previous article for more details and discussion. Discussion should be limited to the ‌iOS 15‌ update and political comments will be immediately removed. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Features\n\r\n\r\nKnow of a feature that we left out?

          "description": "The iOS 15.1 beta that was introduced today allows iPhone users to upload their COVID-19 vaccination status to the Health app and then generate a vaccination card in Apple Wallet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Apple Wallet vaccination card can be shown to businesses, venues, restaurants, and more that are requiring vaccines for entry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs outlined in an announcement to developers, verifiable health records are based on the SMART Health Cards specification. California is using SMART Health Cards, so users in California can add their vaccination records to the Wallet app after installing iOS 15.1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther states and health organizations that use the SMART Health Cards will be able to use a button to let users know that they can download and store their vaccination information in the Health app and in the Wallet app. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCalifornia, Louisiana, New York, Virginia, Hawaii, and some Maryland counties support Smart Health Cards, as do Walmart, Sam's Club, and CVS Health. So those in the specific supported states should be able to look up their information in state databases, but those who were vaccinated through companies like Walmart and CVS will also be able to add their information to the Health and Wallet apps because it's the same system. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that some apps like the one used by the NHS in the UK allowed users to add their vaccination records to the Wallet app, but the new solution is a universal standard that will work for all healthcare providers/states that implement it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscussion should be limited to the app and implementation, and not politics.\nRelated Roundups: iOS 15, iPadOS 15\nTag: COVID-19 Coronavirus\nRelated Forum: iOS 15\nThis article, \"iOS 15.1 Beta Lets Users Add COVID Vaccination Card to Wallet App\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

With the iPhone 13 lineup about to drop into consumers' hands, expect iPhone 12 models to be included in Apple's refurbished listings soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Thanks, Anthony!)\nTags: Apple refurbished products, Canada\nThis article, \"Apple Begins Selling Refurbished iPhones in Canada\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

In a research note seen by MacRumors, Kuo shared some of his key hardware expectations for next year's tentatively named iPhone 14 Pro models, including a hole-punch display and a 48-megapixel Wide lens for the rear camera system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA hole-punch design refers to a display with only a small circular cutout for the front camera, as seen on many recent Samsung smartphones. This design would result in the notch being removed, with Face ID sensors likely moved under the display. Kuo said Apple is also working on iPhones with under-screen Touch ID for release in 2023.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for the rear camera, the 48-megapixel Wide lens would be an upgrade from the 12-megapixel Wide lens on iPhone 13 Pro models.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple is expected to release the iPhone 14 lineup in the second half of 2022, in line with usual launch timing.

          "description": "While it has been many years since Apple stopped providing first weekend sales numbers for new iPhones, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty today said that iPhone 13 Pro pre-orders are \"off to a promising start\" with \"strong early demand.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHuberty based her opinion off of Apple's delivery estimates for iPhones, which she has been tracking for many years. Shortly after pre-orders began last Friday, delivery estimates for the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max began slipping into October, with Huberty having calculated the average lead time at around 27 days. She said this is the second longest lead time on the first day of pre-orders amongst all iPhone models launched over the past five years, surpassed only by the iPhone X in 2017.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs of last Friday, Huberty said the iPhone 13 mini was faring better with a lead time of 3.1 days, while the standard iPhone 13 faced no delays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs with every iPhone launch, it is possible that lengthy delivery estimates are a function of low supply rather than high demand, but Huberty said Morgan Stanley's supply chain checks indicate minimal near-term component headwinds for iPhones and concluded that these long lead times \"are at least partly a function of strong early demand.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll four iPhone 13 models will begin arriving to customers and launch in stores on Friday, September 24. Key features across the iPhone 13 lineup include a faster A15 Bionic chip, camera improvements, longer battery life, and a smaller notch. The two Pro models also feature a ProMotion display with a variable refresh rate up to 120Hz.\nRelated Roundups: iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro\nTags: Katy Huberty, Morgan Stanley\nBuyer's Guide: iPhone 13 (Buy Now), iPhone 13 Pro (Buy Now)\nRelated Forum: iPhone\nThis article, \"iPhone 13 Pro Pre-Orders Off to Promising Start With Strong Early Demand, Says Analyst\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The employee, Janneke Parrish, has been working\nbehind the scenes for months to organize fellow employees who’ve\nfaced harassment and discrimination. […]\nQ: What’s your view on why you were fired?\nI believe I was fired in retaliation for speaking out, for my work\nwith #AppleToo, and out of concern that I was organizing to help\nother employees tell their stories. In my view, this is entirely\nretaliation for trying to bring Apple’s actions to light and\npublicly asking the company to do better.\nUnasked in the interview: whether Parrish actually leaked confidential company information.

That’s a weird one. In the initial WWDC previews, the Bookmarks toolbar button was removed in Safari on both iOS and iPadOS. In the late summer redesign of Safari 15 for iOS, the Bookmarks toolbar button (which you tap to access a hierarchical menu showing all your bookmarks, and which, crucially, remembers which folder you were in the next time you use it) was back where it belongs: in Safari’s bottom-of-the-screen toolbar.\nYet on iPad — which has much more room for toolbar buttons than iPhone — Bookmarks are still squirreled away in the sidebar that is primarily intended for creating, managing, and switching between Tab Groups. Tab Groups are a clever and I think useful new feature. Bookmarks do not belong over there though. Worse, every time you use the Bookmarks menu over in the sidebar on iPadOS 15, you have to navigate from the root level of your bookmarks each time. It doesn’t remember which folder you were in.\nHere’s hoping that more changes to Safari 15 are coming, on both Mac and iPad.\n ★",

Myke Hurley and\nI will offer post-event coverage after it’s all said and done,\nlive on Relay FM.\nThe event name is “Unleashed”, and the motif is a take on going into warp drive or hyperspace.

          "description": "From an editors’ note appended to a New York Times report over the weekend, about COVID-19 vaccinations for children:\nAn earlier version of this article incorrectly described actions\ntaken by regulators in Sweden and Denmark. They have halted use of\nthe Moderna vaccine in children; they have not begun offering\nsingle doses. The article also misstated the number of Covid\nhospitalizations in U.S. children. It is more than 63,000 from\nAugust 2020 to October 2021, not 900,000 since the beginning of\nthe pandemic.\nThe report is from Apoorva Mandavilli, the reporter who replaced longtime science report Donald J. McNeil on the Times’s COVID beat — the same reporter who last month approvingly quoted an epidemiologist who was against booster shots for adults on the nonsensical grounds that “the added benefit may be minimal — and obtained just as easily by wearing a mask, or avoiding indoor dining and crowded bars.”\nThe difference between 63,000 and 900,000 hospitalized children is not a small error — it’s more than an order of magnitude difference. If nearly a million U.S. children had been hospitalized from COVID-19, our entire perception of this pandemic would be fundamentally different. How did this error even make it past editing? It’s not even a remotely plausible figure given our lived experience of this pandemic.\nHere’s a good example of how mind-boggling this error is.

In the end, it seems like Apple’s SoC\nteam has executed well after all.\nA thorough review, as usual. Interesting to contrast with Dylan Patel’s much-publicized “Apple CPU Gains Grind to a Halt and the Future Looks Dim” hot take last month, just after the Apple event.

Then I realized that Syniverse’s “customers” are entire carriers, not individual people. So, yeah, this is bad.\nSyniverse repeatedly declined to answer specific questions from\nMotherboard about the scale of the breach and what specific data\nwas affected, but according to a person who works at a telephone\ncarrier, whoever hacked Syniverse could have had access to\nmetadata such as length and cost, caller and receiver’s numbers,\nthe location of the parties in the call, as well as the content of\nSMS text messages. […]\nThe company wrote that it discovered the breach in May 2021, but\nthat the hack began in May of 2016.\nNot what you want.\n ★",

          "description": "John Jurgensen, writing for The Wall Street Journal (News+):\nNow he’s attempting to re-engage with a show that offers fewer\njokes and a more earnest agenda. With his new biweekly series,\n“The Problem With Jon Stewart,” his first challenge is getting\npeople to notice it at all. Apple TV+ is decidedly more plush but\nless entrenched than basic cable.\nFans will find aspects of “The Problem With Jon Stewart” familiar.\nIn front of an audience, he sits at a table for an opening\nmonologue (now wearing a T-shirt and bomber jacket instead of a\nsuit and tie). He twirls his pen, pauses for deadpan stares into\nthe camera, stifles giggles behind his fist and makes\nself-deprecating cracks like, “I am what’s left of Jon Stewart.”\nBreaking from his previous format, the show includes unscripted\nsegments in the show’s writers’ room, where Mr. Stewart and his\nstaff banter over each episode’s topic (expanded on in a weekly\ncompanion podcast). A separate panel discussion captures the\nshow’s sober tone.\nI watched the first episode and was bored to tears. I certainly sympathize with the plight of U.S. veterans who’ve been gravely harmed by the burning of toxic waste, but the show itself felt like a droll hour-long lecture — not a good sign when the show was in fact only 40 minutes long. Strong “When is this going to be over?” vibes. It was like being stuck back in school.\nI’m not saying Stewart can or should only do comedy. I like serious issue-based shows, too, but the good ones, like 60 Minutes, move along at a fast clip. John Oliver’s Last Week Tonight devotes itself to the most serious issues in the world today, but the show is entertaining, fast-paced, and funny as hell. It moves. The premiere of The Problem With Jon Stewart can only be described as “plodding”. I’ll give it another shot this week, but one more like last week’s and I’m out.\n ★",

The company’s stock\nprice has risen nearly 30 percent in the past year, lifted by\nstrong advertising revenue and a spike in use of some products\nduring the pandemic. Facebook is still growing in countries\noutside the United States, and could succeed there even if it\nstumbles domestically. And the company has invested heavily in\nnewer initiatives, like augmented and virtual reality products,\nthat could turn the tide if they’re successful.\nBut Facebook’s research tells a clear story, and it’s not a happy\none. Its younger users are flocking to Snapchat and TikTok, and\nits older users are posting anti-vaccine memes and arguing about\npolitics. Some Facebook products are actively shrinking, while\nothers are merely making their users angry or self-conscious.\nFacebook’s declining relevance with young people shouldn’t\nnecessarily make its critics optimistic. History teaches us that\nsocial networks rarely age gracefully, and that tech companies can\ndo a lot of damage on the way down.\n ★",

We don’t\nget anything. And we don’t like this. We know our constituents\ndon’t like this. But if we don’t do these stories, we don’t get\ndistributed. And so it used to be that we did very little of it,\nand now we have to do a lot of it, because we have jobs to do. And\nif we don’t get traffic and engagement, we’ll lose our jobs.”\nHaugen’s whistleblowing jibes exactly with my theory all along: Facebook prioritizes growth and engagement over all else, and when they discovered that polarizing angering content drives engagement more than anything else, they let it fly.

For them, several years of\nApple innovations will be rolled into a single purchase. But\nreviews of the new iPhones will not address what happened in 2018,\nor 2019, or 2020.\nHere’s an attempt to provide a little more of a big-picture\noverview for owners of older iPhones who are wondering what’s new\nin the iPhone 13. I’ve simplified matter a little — if you own a\n“plus” or “max” model of iPhone, obviously your phone will be a\nlittle larger, and you may want to consider the direct upgrade to\nthe iPhone 13 Pro Max to continue with your large phone. The\niPhone 13 mini is also a great option for those who prefer a\nsmaller phone with all the same power as the larger iPhone 13.\nThis is a fantastic idea. You just scroll down to whatever iPhone you’re currently using, and boom, there’s a list of the top upgrades you’d experience if you upgrade to an iPhone 13. Apple’s excellent iPhone Compare page has all this information, but the Compare page also tells you everything that’s the same or roughly equivalent between models.

          "description": "Last April, after posting this photo of my desk setup for my iPad Air review, I got a few questions about the stand I was using to prop up the iPad. The answer was Anker’s $15 Multi-Angle Stand. Last week I posted a similar photo, this time for my iPad Mini review, and I’m still using the same stand. Alas, that stand is no longer available.\nThe closest thing I could find is this $10 copy of that stand from Amazon Basics. It’s such a blatant rip-off of Anker’s stand that ordinarily I wouldn’t link to it, on principle, but, given that Anker’s original is seemingly no longer being produced, a rip-off design is the best we can do. I even bought one to try it out before linking to it. (If you buy one through this link, I’ll earn affiliate revenue that will get me one step closer to buying one of the upcoming Jony Ive/Marc Newson-designed electric Ferraris.)\nAmazon’s multi-angle stand is extremely similar to Anker’s in size, weight, and angles of tilt. But it’s slightly lacking in fit and finish compared to Anker’s. Whereas Anker’s felt like a bargain at $15, this one feels like what you’d expect from a $10 knock-off. My biggest annoyance is that Amazon, for some reason, decided to screen print “Press/Presse” on the button that you quite obviously must press to adjust the tilt. (Why French?) This is as helpful as printing “Press” on the knock of a click pen. And of course they typeset these needless words in Arial. A wee nip of nail polish remover took care of that, though.\nI still recommend it. It folds flat, and when your iPad is sitting in it, the stand effectively disappears.\n ★",

          "description": "A bunch of you are probably getting new iPhones (and iPads) today. As someone who’s set up 5 new devices in the last week, my advice is to restore a new iPhone with the Quick Start device-to-device transfer, not iCloud backup. Don’t worry if it says it might take a little longer this way, it’s worth it. Get a cup of coffee or a bite to eat. A watched pot never boils; a watched transfer never finishes.\nDevice-to-device is better because it moves over all your login credentials. When you restore from an iCloud backup, you wind up logged out of a lot of apps on the new device. When you restore device-to-device, almost everything moves over. I know there are exceptions, but I don’t think I bounced into a single app that didn’t keep me fully logged in this week. If you tried device-to-device a few years ago and found it lacking, try it again now — Apple has improved this process every year since it debuted. Worst case scenario, you can always start over and use iCloud backup.\nAlso, you do not need to unpair your Apple Watch from your old iPhone using this method. You can just wear your watch the whole time. When the transfer is complete, the new iPhone will prompt you, asking if you want to move your watch to the new iPhone. Your mileage may vary but it just worked for me.\nI posted this on Twitter tonight, and realized I should post about this here too. The Twitter thread has a bunch of Q&A’s about specific apps, like authentication tokens in Authy (they transfer fine).\n ★",

Very much looking forward to giving\nit a spin!\nAmen to this enthusiasm for seeing the product introduction live. I get it why Apple did not hold an in-person press event last week — iPhone events are huge, and while I think small events can safely be held in person now, there’s no practical way to shrink the iPhone event.\nI miss having hands-on time with new devices as soon as keynotes end. You pick up on things immediately: that something is heavier or lighter than you expected. That certain colors or finishes look different. Remember the Jet Black iPhone 7? You had to see it in person to understand how it looked. And I miss in-person briefings, both official ones and unofficial. In-person communication simply cannot be beaten for conveying subtlety.\nProduct reviews are hampered too. With in-person Apple events, most reviewers get kit in the hours after the keynote ends. With virtual Apple events, the kit ships for delivery the next day. An extra day makes a big difference when the review embargo drops just one week after the event.\n ★",

          "description": "Nice supercut video from The Verge squeezing Microsoft’s Surface event yesterday into eight minutes. A few thoughts:\nIt seems like Microsoft is letting the Surface division stand on its own, brand-wise. They’re not distancing themselves from Microsoft in any way, but branding-wise they’re just letting the products be the “Surface Whatever”, not the “Microsoft Surface Whatever”. There’s even a moment in the event, regarding the folding Duo 2 phone, when a guy says it has “the most precise and reliable hinge mechanism ever engineered at Surface”. I.e. that it was “Surface” who engineered that hinge, not “Microsoft”. I think Surface works as a Microsoft sub-brand like that.\nSpeaking of the Surface Duo 2 — their folding phone with two screens — they’re now just calling it what they should have called it all along: a phone. It’s a very interesting and unique form factor, but it’s a big folding phone, not a small folding tablet. It supposedly has real cameras this time, too. Starting price: $1,500.\nThe new Surface Laptop Studio looks really dumb to me. I don’t understand why one would ever want to use it in either of the new folding positions. I guess maybe if you really want to draw on it, you might want to fold it flat, but if you really want to draw that much, why not buy the Surface Pro 8 that detaches from the keyboard? This design just seems dumb.\nThe Surface Slim Pen 2 introduces haptic feedback, to simulate the feel of a pen on paper. I love stuff like that.\n ★",

          "description": "Joe Rossignol, reporting for MacRumors:\nApple Watch Series 7 models are equipped with a new module that\nenables 60.5GHz wireless data transfer, according to FCC\nfilings viewed by MacRumors, but this functionality may be\nreserved for Apple’s internal use only for now.\nThe filings indicate that the 60.5GHz module is only activated\nwhen the Apple Watch is placed on a proprietary magnetic dock with\na corresponding 60.5GHz module, but this dock will likely be\nreserved for use by Apple employees. For example, it’s possible\nthat Apple Stores might use the dock to wirelessly restore an\nApple Watch, and if so, it will be interesting to see if Series 7\nmodels still have a hidden diagnostic port for wired connectivity.\nThis is a little interesting in and of itself. But if you look at the long-term trend, it’s a sign that Apple — along with the rest of the industry — is moving toward wireless technology for both charging and data transfer. Apple Watch exemplifies that — it’s never had a port, either for charging or data. There’s a diagnostic port hidden inside the bottom channel for the watch strap, but those diagnostics are neither charging nor data.\nIt’s long been my guess that iPhone is never going to support USB-C. I think it’s Apple’s intention to go straight from Lightning to wireless/inductive, with no “port”. Portless is the future for all devices. Yet the product design geniuses at the European Commission want to mandate all devices have one specific port in 2024 and indefinitely thereafter — a port that by that time will already be 10 years old.\n ★",

          "description": "Judd Legum, writing at Popular Information:\nOn Friday, CEO Tim Cook answered a question about Apple’s stance\non the Texas ban at an all-staff meeting. Cook said that “the\ncompany was looking into whether it could aid the legal fight\nagainst the new law.”\nApple has considerable leverage over the abortion debate in Texas\nand across the country — but it is not related to its ability to\npay for lawyers. Apple’s leverage rests in its status as a major\nemployer and driver of economic growth.\nIf Apple believes that its employees should be able to “make their\nown decisions regarding their reproductive health,” it could\npublicly state that it will not expand its workforce in states\nthat limit abortion rights. That would have a major influence not\nonly in Texas but in numerous states considering following Texas’\nlead.\nLast week, TechCrunch published the text of a company-wide memo posted to an internal Apple message board regarding Texas’s near-outlawing of abortion. It began:\nA message about women’s reproductive health care\nAt Apple, we support our employees’ rights to make their own\ndecisions regarding their reproductive health.\nLegum is right — it’s untenable for Apple, or any other company, to “support our employees’ rights to make their own decisions regarding their reproductive health” and ask any woman to work for the company in a state with a law like Texas’s. An immediate hiring and construction freeze in Texas — explicitly tied to this outrageous law (which makes no exceptions for rape or incest) — is the only tenable action compatible with Apple’s stated values.\nDavid Simon, linking to Legum’s post:\nIf an employer, this is beyond politics. I’m turning in scripts\nnext month on an HBO non-fiction miniseries based on events in\nTexas, but I can’t and won’t ask female cast/crew to forgo civil\nliberties to film there. What else looks like Dallas/Ft. Worth?\nThat’s the answer. You move your business out of Texas.

I thought it would be\ninteresting to look at some basic iPhone benchmarks through the\nyears and look at how much performance improvement happens every\nfour years.\nIncremental improvements every year turn into profound improvements over 3–4 years. It’s like the technology version of compound interest. It adds up.\nAs I benchmarked the A15 Bionic in different ways and pondered how\nApple spends its transistor budget with each A-series chip cycle,\nan interesting shift emerged for iPhone 13. Going back to how\nApple spends their transistor budget on features, not necessarily\nperformance, for the A15, Apple looks to have had the most GPU\ngains YoY since the A9. For the past five years, Apple has had an\naverage of 19% GPU gains YoY but for the A15 Bionic, Apple has\nincreased GPU performance by 52%.\nThis intentional increase in GPU performance over CPU performance\nspeaks to the more graphically intense features Apple had in mind\nfor iPhone 13 that is demonstrated in things like macro\nphotography, macro video, and Cinematic Mode. Developers also now\nhave a dramatically increased GPU at their disposal to create new\napp experiences around and can leverage new augmented reality\ntechniques, visual computing and AI, and more.\nIt’s almost enough to make one think that Apple is ready to release high-end professional Macs built around Apple GPUs.\n ★",

He was annoyed by the same jarring automatic switch between the 1× to 0.5× lens when entering or leaving macro mode that I mentioned in my review:\nI welcome greater detail for close-ups and it’s clever that Apple\nis using the ultra-wide to augment the 1× wide and 3× telephoto at\nshort distances, but the transitioning of cameras is disorienting.\nApple makes no mention of this camera switching/augmenting on its\niPhone 13 Pro website. I get that it’s supposed to be one of those\n“it just works” features. At least that was Apple’s intention I’m\ntold, but it just doesn’t.\nHere’s a screen recording of the automatic camera switching in\naction. In this shot, I was trying to frame these delicious soup\ndumplings using the grid. Holding the iPhone 13 Pro still, you can\nsee the 1× wide switching to another slightly different FOV that’s\nusing the ultra-wide autofocusing. The viewfinder keeps jittering\nas it tries to choose between a regular wide or wide-macro shot. A\nregular person wouldn’t look at this and think to themselves, this\nis normal. They’d look at the jittering and think something is\nbroken with their iPhone camera. The framing should never change\nfrom what you compose and never automatically.\nWong’s screen recording illustrates the issue perfectly.\nWhen I first pressed Apple and made them aware of the jarring\ncamera switching, I was told it’s how the camera system works. On\nthe eve of this review, Apple changed course and said it’s going\nto release a software update to let users disable the camera\nswitching. According to Apple:\nA new setting will be added in a software update this fall to turn\noff automatic camera switching when shooting at close distances\nfor macro photography and video.\n ★",

[…]\nWhere the Pro 13 camera system shines is in low light. The main\nwide-angle sensor has seen a massive upgrade this year. Unlike\nAndroid phones that are chasing big megapixel counts and then\n“pixel binning” to achieve low light performance, Apple is\nsticking with 12 megapixels, the same resolution it’s used since\n2015’s iPhone 6S. The sensor itself is much bigger now and\nfeatures 1.9 µm pixels, which are about as big as anything we’ve\nseen on a smartphone. And on top of all that, the lens now has an\nƒ/1.5 aperture.\nAll of that adds up to a camera that can very quickly take in a\nmassive amount of light relative to other phones. Combined with\nsome tuning and improvements to Apple’s computational photography,\nthe low light performance on the 13 Pro is simply second to none.\nI came away super impressed with the low light performance of the 13 Pro, too.\nBohn makes an important point in his corresponding review of the 13 and 13 Mini too: because the camera bumps are all new sizes, cases for the iPhone 13 won’t fit the 13 Pro, nor vice-versa.\n ★",

What I find interesting is Apple is going to use this acquisition to launch a dedicated classical music app, not to expand the Music app. iTunes, infamously, expanded greatly over the years, and everyone seems to agree that the user experience suffered for it.

          "description": "Image: Valve\n    \n\n  \nVerified, playable with some tinkering, or forget it are your options\n Valve is introducing a rating system that will let players know which of Steam’s 50,000 games are compatible with the Steam Deck, the handheld gaming PC due to launch by the end of the year.\nSteam Deck Verified, as the metric is called, will peg a game as fully compatible, partially compatible, or incompatible with the Steam Deck. Officially, these categories are verified, playable, unsupported, and unknown.\n“Any verified game is a great, smooth experience on Deck,” says the narrator in the video above. Playable means “they’ll require a little more manual involvement to configure and play.” Unsupported means the game “just isn’t playable on Deck.” Unknown means the game hasn’t been evaluated yet for its Steam Deck playability.\nVerified games have full controller support, support Steam Deck’s default resolution (1280x800 or 1280x720), and other basic capabilities. The first tab in the Steam Store, as shown on Steam Deck, will only show games that are “great on Deck.” Users’ game libraries will have compatibility badges shown prominently on each title.\nSteam Deck Verified’s official page says Valve is reviewing the entire Steam catalog for its compatibility. A game’s rating may also change, as developers provide post-release support or options that include Steam Deck — or as Steam Deck’s software improves.\nSteam Deck, announced in July, launches in December with units starting at $399. The handheld features a 7-inch touchscreen. Players can also purchase a dock that allows the Steam Deck to run on a TV, like the Nintendo Switch.\nStorage, however, may be a big shortcoming for the Steam Deck. The base model only offers 64 GB; a $529 mid-level option has 256 GB of space; the top-shelf $649 Steam Deck has a 512 GB solid-state drive. Even though the unit can be opened up by users and the hard drives may be replaced, Valve is strongly recommending folks don’t do that.",

Interested players can sign up for the beta test before Nov. 1 at the game’s website to take part.\n\n\nBandai Namco says that players who are selected for the closed network test will be able to experience the opening hours of Elden Ring during the following dates and times:\nNov. 12: 3 a.m. to 6 a.m. PST\nNov. 12: 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. PST\nNov. 13: 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. PST\nNov. 14: 3 a.m. to 6 a.m. PST\nNov. 14: 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. PST\nElden Ring was originally announced in June 2019 at E3. The fantasy action-role-playing game is a collaboration between FromSoftware and A Song of Ice and Fire author George R.R. Martin, and sends players to the Lands Between as a Tarnished to restore the titular Elden Ring and become the region’s new lord. For more on the game, check out Polygon’s Elden Ring preview.

Set after Bruce Wayne’s death, playable heroes Robin, Nightwing, Batgirl, and the Red Hood will contend with classic Batman villains like Mr. Freeze, as well as a powerful new threat: the Court of Owls, a generations-long conspiracy of Gotham City’s wealthiest families.\nOriginally expected in 2021, Gotham Knights is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X, in 2022.

But the update also includes some big changes to Halo 2, offering graphical improvements to the 17-year-old video game.\nHalo 2 had some issues in the The Master Chief Collection. Specifically, it took some of the major graphical flaws from the Windows Vista version of the game and ported them into  343 Industries’ historical Halo package. Generalkidd, a Halo YouTuber, broke down some of the biggest changes in a new video.\n\n\nGeneralkidd called out lighting fixes and crossfades, and general visual changes that bring it closer to the original Halo 2. There’s also footage of a major bug fix in the Halo 2 level “The Great Journey,” where a Brute would classically flip a Wraith, rendering it nonlethal to the player. With season 8, the Brute has learned to drive properly, and now poses a threat. Ghosts also self-destruct properly now, an issue that’s been present in the Master Chief Collection since its launch in 2014.\nThe video goes over a whole host of similar changes, and is definitely worth a watch for potential Halo historians. These changes may seem small to many players — and they are, for the most part. But with Halo: The Master Chief Collection acting as a history of one of the most influential and important video game franchises of all time, it’s nice that Halo 2 finally looks like Bungie intended back in 2004.",

Binge’s Chief Content Officer, Allan Ungar, will be producer on the project.\n“I’ve always believed that a live action adaptation of System Shock would be the perfect medium to retell the harrowing story of Citadel station and its rogue AI that subjects the crew to unimaginable horror,” Kick told Deadline. “We’re very excited to see the talented team at Binge bring System Shock to life in horrifyingly real and new ways.”\nOriginally released in 1994, System Shock follows a security hacker on space station Citadel, who must fight against a rogue artificial intelligence named SHODAN. Developed by LookingGlass Technologies and published by Origin Systems, the first-person game is set in a cyberpunk-tinged version of 2072. System Shock was highly influential, with the Bioshock games regarded as successors. (Fun fact: Gone Home supposedly also exists in the same universe as Bioshock and System Shock).\nThe System Shock adaptation will be one of several properties in Binge’s games-leaning original content slate — this, so far, includes a TV adaptation of Ubisoft’s Driver, which is the early aughts, comparatively lower-key competitor to Grand Theft Auto.

          "description": "Image: Riot Games\n    \n\n  \nMeet the Chemtech and Hextech Dragons\n League of Legends works on a seasonal model, where developer Riot Games starts off a fresh year with lots of changes to the competitive game. This upcoming preseason is no exception, and fans can expect big changes to Summoner’s Rift on PC. \nOn Thursday, Riot released a video called “Preseason 2022 and the State of the Game,” in which the developer discussed new champion balance — and admitted that some recent champions have had a few too many tools in their belt — as well as new mythic and legendary items, changes to the runes system, new bounties for objectives and towers, and the star of the preview: some wild new dragons.\n\n\nDragons are a powerful map objective. They spawn in the river pit on the bottom side of the map, and can come in one of a few elemental varieties. Each elemental dragon changes the terrain of the map, and offers buffs when killed, making it an important task for teams to prioritize.\nPreseason 2022 is adding two new dragons. The Hextech Dragon offers gates around the map that allow for teleportation. The Chemtech Dragon grants players extra damage when their health is low, and when they die, they get a second shot at killing their enemies with a short-lived ghost form. In addition, the Chemtech Dragon creates camouflage zones around the map to hide teams. Sneaky!\nPreseason 2022 will be available on the game’s test environment in a couple of weeks, and Riot will dial back these new changes if they disrupt the game a little too much. Right now, League of Legends esports teams are competing in the game’s yearly Worlds tournament. Arcane, a television series that explores Hextech and Chemtech in the cities of Zaun and Piltover, will debut on Netflix in November.",

While Platinum is intentionally going for “oil painting style” graphics with Babylon’s Fall, some found the aesthetic to be too muddy and stylized. So Platinum’s changing that.\nOn Wednesday, PlatinumGames and Square Enix showed off the revised graphics for Babylon’s Fall, which, while certainly clearer, still maintain the studio’s “brushwork style” that’s based on classical European oil paintings. You can see the revised graphical style in the slider image below, with the new graphics shown on the right.\n\n\nOn Babylon’s Fall’s official website, the developers revealed the new graphics in an update from the game’s closed beta test. Regarding the graphics, the developers said, “This was an area we received many strong opinions and requests about in Phases 1 and 2 of the Closed Beta Test, particularly regarding poor visibility. Accordingly, we have been working to improve the overall visual clarity, while still keeping the distinctive classic fantasy oil painting aesthetic.”\nSo, yeah, things are far less blurry in the latest version of Babylon’s Fall — which does not have a release date.\nSquare Enix and PlatinumGames announced Babylon’s Fall way back in 2018.

On Tuesday, Treyarch revealed what players can expect from the season 6 battle pass, including new Operators and new weapons for both Black Ops Cold War and Warzone. \nCold War season 6’s battle pass will add a couple of new weapons to the game. The first is the new .410 Ironhide shotgun, which is available at Tier 15. The Ironhide is extremely slow, but it’s a heavy hitting weapon with a pretty long range one-shot kill — at least for a shotgun. The battle pass also adds the Grav assault rifle at Tier 31. The Grav will have a range similar to the QBZ-83 and the fastest muzzle velocity of any assault rifle in the game, along with a 35-round magazine on the base version.\nThe season 6 battle pass will include Alex Mason as the game’s newest Operator. The protagonist from the original Call of Duty: Black Ops has seen better days, but he’s back for the fight as the Cold War continues. The pass will also add several Operator skins including an Adler skin, the Aurora Borealis Mason skin, and more.\nThe new season patch will arrive on Oct. 6 at 12 a.m. ET for Black Ops Cold War and Oct. 7 at 12 a.m. ET for Call of Duty: Warzone.

No, it’s just ditching its logo (Orange 021 C and good ol’ Process Yellow making a rich Pantone 185 C) in favor of an anodyne word-balloon wordmark.\nIn a statement, the company said the outgoing logo “expresses the fusion of Bandai and Namco that was created when the two companies integrated,” although not necessarily in that order, back in 2006. “It will be replaced with a new logo that reflects our new Purpose.”\nSooooo … what is that new purpose?

Kotaku on Friday morning pointed out that users on 2ch, Japan’s largest bulletin board, were throwing shade on Bandai Namco’s new look:\n“Looks like Twitch’s logo,” says one (speaking for me, too). “And the orange logo was so nice,” said another.

To describe Ito’s new game as minimalist might be underselling it; players appear to walk through grid-based labyrinths, are rewarded for mapping them out, and occasionally fall into menu-based battles against monsters. Dungeon Encounters’ first trailer is perplexing and perhaps a bit distressing for fans of Ito’s past work — but I remain hopeful.\nIn addition to Ito, Final Fantasy 12: The Zodiac Age producer Hiroaki Kato — who also worked on Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together and two Final Fantasy Tactics games for Square Enix — is also working on the game. Musical director Nobuo Uematsu is “overseeing” the soundtrack, and Dungeon Encounters features character art from designer Ryoma Ito, whose talents are on display here.\nImage: Square Enix\n  \nWhile it appears we’ll see many of the game’s characters in 2D static artwork form, there is a big fat cat named Sir Cat and a dachshund with a sword in its mouth named Jufren, and I already want to spend time with them.\nBeyond that, Square Enix promises “100 levels of thought-provoking challenges,” so I’m approaching Dungeon Encounters from the angle of “this looks like a good puzzle game, not something with an actual budget” and hoping for the best.\nDungeon Encounters will be available digitally for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Windows PC via Steam on Oct. 14. The game will cost $29.99, but is currently discounted to $23.99 for pre-orders.",

In Chaos Gate, players take the role of the Space Marine chapter known as the Grey Knights, and take the fight to Chaos in an X-Com style game.\nThe Grey Knights are a mysterious Space Marine chapter; while games like Space Marine focus on the Ultramarines, who take the front lines, the Grey Knights are more about the mystical and faith-based sides of the Imperium. In battling back Chaos Space Marines and a mysterious disease known as the Bloom, the Grey Knights will need to update their base of operations, build new facilities, run research projects, and head into combat missions. \nOnce Grey Knights are in the field, players will need to upgrade them into classes. There are four classes, and players can customize their armor and facial options to create their own special squad. Chaos Space Marines evolve as well, which escalates combat and forces players to focus on strategy.\nThe narrative is written by Black Library author Aaron Dembski-Bowden, so this should have some interesting lore for Warhammer fans.\nWarhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters is currently planned to release on PC in 2022.",

Take-Two has not announced the Definitive Edition release, but the publisher said in August that it has three “new iterations of previously released titles,” which it describes as “ports and remastered titles,” in its pipeline.\nA remaster of the trilogy — Grand Theft Auto 3, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas — has long been rumored. A report from Kotaku in August, citing sources, said that the three games are being remastered in Unreal Engine with a mix of new and old graphics, as well as an updated (but still classic) user interface.\nA Rockstar Games spokesperson did not provide comment on the rating when contacted by Polygon.\nRockstar Games already publishes those Grand Theft Auto games under the title Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy for other platforms, according to listings on the PlayStation Store for PlayStation 4 and Steam for Windows PC.",

          "description": "Image: Amazon Game Studios\n    \n\n  \nThe MMO has hundreds of thousands of players and massive queue times\n Amazon’s MMO New World was finally released on Tuesday after months of testing and delays, but it’s already a little too popular for its servers. This has led to long queues as players try to log into the game.\nDuring its official launch day of Sept. 28, New World peaked at number two on Steam with a player count of just over 700,000. This massive player count is good news for Amazon, but the game’s servers apparently weren’t up to the task. The game has over 26,000 Steam reviews, and most of them — which Steam labels as Mixed, with just 48% skewing positive at the time of writing — complain about the game’s massive queues and limited server capacity. \nOf course, Amazon Game Studios is more than aware of New World’s problem. In a launch day update post on the game’s website, the developer explained that its short-term goal is setting up new servers and working to expand the capacity of the ones that are already online, in order to help everyone log in and play as soon as possible. \nAmazon Game Studios also has a long-term plan to let players transfer their characters to an entirely new server for free in the next two weeks. This should help balance the load so that certain overpopulated servers aren’t too stressed, while lower-population servers — with lower queue times — should get a boost in players to even things out.\nWhile all of these plans should help reduce the queue times in the future for New World, it’s likely that players will still have to deal with a wait to log in for the next few days, especially on more populated servers. But as Amazon rolls out its solutions, and the hype eventually dies down a bit, players should hopefully be able to get into Aeternum a little more quickly.",

This time around the track is called “Burn it All Down” by the synth-pop band Pvris, while the video was created by Haoliners Animation. \nThe new video features several current and former League of Legends stars battling it out and transforming into some of their signature champions. Lee “Faker” Sang-hyeok, one of League’s most famous players and most frequent world champion, returns for this video, which is particularly fitting since he’s back on the Worlds’ stage this year after missing out in 2020. The video also features players like last year’s Worlds’ MVP Kim “Canyon” Geon-bu, and former-world champions Kim “DoinB” Tae-sang, who is one of the top players heading into the tournament this year. \nRiot releases a new Worlds theme song every year, generally partnering with new artists each time. In 2014 Imagine Dragons wrote the song Warriors for the event, while Zedd, who worked with Riot on creating weapon skins in Valorant earlier this year, wrote Ignite for Worlds 2016. This is the first time that Riot has worked with Pvris. Meanwhile Chinese animation studio Haoliners Animation had worked with Riot on several projects before partnering for this video. \nThe 2021 League of Legends World Championship will begin with its preliminary play-in stage on Oct. 5 in Reykjavík, Iceland.

But unlike previous schedules, which listed out the exact dates for events and quests, Season of the Lost’s calendar roadmap is surprisingly sparse. \nSeason of the Lost is already in a unique position. Due to The Witch Queen’s delay earlier this year, Season of the Lost will run from August of this year to Feb. 22, 2022.

Most of the stuff in these kits is available only if players buy them, but Maxis added a new, free base game update, too. And it’s an update that’s been a long time coming — expert Sims builders have been asking for this level of customization for some time now. The Sims 4 art team added around 1,200 new item variants to 149 base game items in Build Mode, publisher Electronic Arts said in an update on The Sims 4 website. To put it simply, 149 items now have a massive selection of different color and pattern swatches, which means that you can make things match in new ways. Curtains! Wood swatches that match! Colorful stoves!\nThe full list of items is available on The Sims 4 blog. In particular, I’m getting real Ironwood Kitchenette vibes from the new VAULT Modular kitchen set.\nImage: Maxis/Electronic Arts\n  \nIt’s not only inside stuff, either: There are new swatches for gardening, as well as plants themselves, plus all 64 base game windows have been updated, too. It’s overwhelming and very exciting — there’s so much room for deeper customization with these additional swatches. Of course, it’s no Create a Style, which let The Sims 3 players fully customize object patterns and colors.\nStill, it’s a step closer.",

The worst of these is a camera stutter that happens just about every time players move their mouse. It’s an extremely frustrating issue, but one that Arkane hopes to have fixed with a new patch released on Tuesday. \nAccording to the patch notes that Arkane released with the new update, Tuesday’s hotfix aims to address issues that PC players have had where “mouse-based camera movements could result in the appearance of ‘stutter.’” That’s a lot of qualifiers to parse, but it seems like Arkane is saying that these aren’t actually frame rate stutters, they just have the “appearance” of them. Whatever the problem was, hopefully this patch makes it feel a little better.\nWhile the camera problem might be solved, it isn’t the only problem with Deathloop’s PC port. Arkane also explains in the patch notes that it’s looking into other problems as well. For instance, when you play Deathloop at an extremely high frame rate, the game also encounters a stutter. In our experience the game became nearly unplayable at 240 fps thanks to this issue, but it was fine when locked at 140 fps. In Tuesday’s patch notes, Arkane said that it thinks it’s identified the problem and will update players when it has more information. \nEven if there are still a few problems, the good news is Arkane seems to be working on them and trying to make the PC port as smooth as possible for players.",

Siren Shrines and Treasuries are arriving to the Sea of Thieves, and players will be able to either track them on their boat’s map, or look for the telltale shimmer of siren treasure on the surface of the water. The reward, of course, is tons of treasure.\nSome underwater enemies were introduced during the previous season, A Pirate’s Life, which included a crossover with Disney’s Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. They play a much bigger role in season 4. Siren shrines seem to have a lot in common with the above-water fort, except instead of skeletons, players have to work their way through waves of sirens, coral beasts, and other threats. They also have to solve puzzles to get to the final wave of treasure. \nLuckily, helpful mermaids will help pirates transport their loot to the surface in one go, so you don’t have to worry about the long trip back and forth with all of your coral-encrusted treasure. Coral-encrusted bottles have washed up on the shores, which give the player voyages into the Sunken Kingdom in order to find the Breath of the Sea. This mysterious potion sells and gives rep to the training companies.\nPirates can earn special coral-related cosmetics, like a ship set, scars, and even a curse by completing the new Sunken Kingdom. There’s also a Plunder Pass, which is free and offers 100 free levels of gear and currencies. An updated Plunder Pass grants some extra cosmetics for interested players.\nSea of Thieves’ new season is planned to launch on Sept. 23, and is a free addition to the game.

It outlined a plan for overturning the election by claiming that seven states actually had competing state slates of electors, which while not even remotely true, would have given Mike Pence the excuse to throw out those states and thus hand the election to Trump.\nBut of course the plan required election officials in those states to go along. Trump thought the ones who were Republican would. Most did not. And that’s what he’s been working on fixing ever since.\n\n\n\nYou might have strong feelings about Bill Maher. Ok, fine.

          "description": "Originally written as a Facebook post in the wake of the 2016 election, Timothy Snyder’s On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century went on to become a bestseller and a prescient warning on what was to come for America. Now, a graphic edition of On Tyranny has been released, designed and illustrated by Nora Krug. From Steven Heller’s piece on the book in Print:\nKrug’s goal for this project was to use her medium to echo Snyder’s call for action. “While it was important to me to create images that would highlight the contemporary relevance of Snyder’s message,” she writes, “the use of historic images was clearly essential. At moments in the book that refer to a particular event in time — such as this one about Hitler’s annexation of Austria, when Austrian Nazis captured Jews and forced them to scrub the streets clean — I felt that rather than showing my own visual representation of that event, it was more powerful to feature a historic photograph because of the immediacy of the medium that would make that moment in history come to life.”\nCombining Krug’s drawings with historic materials gave her the license to contrast the documentary with the imagined, the factual with the poetic, and to create a narrative tension that emphasizes historical relationships. “More importantly,” she explains, “this combination of mediums allows me to admit to the fact that we don’t exist in a vacuum, that we can only exist in relationship to the past, that everything we think and feel is thought and felt in reference to it, that our future is deeply rooted in our history, and that we will always be active contributors to shaping how the past is viewed and what our future will look like.”\n\n\nYou can order the graphic version of On Tyranny here but it seems to be backordered in most places.\nTags: books   Nora Krug   On Tyranny   politics   Steven Heller   Timothy Snyder   USA",

But is it also making the game boring?\nThe math states that scoring one-third of your shots from behind the 3-point line is as good as scoring half your shots from inside the line. In other words: Shooting as many 3s as possible will likely lead to a higher score.\nThe league took notice, and teams and players followed suit. 3s have become so prevalent in recent years that fans are criticizing the league for being oversaturated with them. Critics worry that the game is on the verge of becoming boring because everyone is trying to do the same thing. And that’s led some to wonder if the NBA should move the 3-point line back.\n\n\nCheck out the “additional reading” in the YouTube description, like The NBA is at a breaking point with three-point shooting and Is It Time to Move the NBA 3-Point Line Back?

From A COVID Serenity Prayer in The Atlantic:\nFor the past 18 months, my patients have craved straightforward answers: a simple “Yes-it’s perfectly safe” or “Go for it. Have fun!” or even a “No, you absolutely cannot” to quiet the endless loops of risk calculations. But medicine is not about certainty. It never has been.\nThe two things that patients want-reassurance that they won’t get COVID-19 and permission to engage in life-I cannot deliver, and I never will be able to. SARS-CoV-2 is here to stay. The virus will be woven into our everyday existence much like RSV, influenza, and other common coronaviruses are. The question isn’t whether we’ll be exposed to the novel coronavirus; it’s when.\nAnd although many of us will inevitably get COVID-19, for the majority of vaccinated people, it won’t be so bad. The vaccines weren’t designed to wholly prevent COVID-19; they transformed it into a manageable illness like the flu.\nThat means that, from a decision-making perspective, we’re starting to reach the acceptance phase of the pandemic: a time when we must recalibrate our individual risk gauges, which have been completely thrown out of whack. The approach I’m embracing with patients boils down to a secular version of the serenity prayer. We need “the serenity to accept the things [we] cannot change, courage to change the things [we] can, and the wisdom to know the difference.”\n\n\n Tags: Covid-19   Lucy McBride   medicine",

          "description": "From 2019 to 2021, a small Spanish football team was renamed Flat Earth FC, both as a publicity stunt and because club president Javi Poves couldn’t understand how water “curves”.\n“Football is the most popular sport and has the most impact worldwide, so creating a club dedicated to the flat earth movement is the best way to have a constant presence in the media,” said Poves earlier this year. “Flat Earth FC is the first football club whose followers are united by the most important thing, which is an idea.”\nThe club’s crest is now a circular image of the earth, pressed flat on to all kits, and fans are encouraged to spark regular conversations in their pursuit of answers from the powers that be. The team mascot? An astronaut. It’s a radical move, but the club is bringing in supporters from afar. “It’s really amazing to be part of this amazing movement,” says Flat Earth player Mario Cardete. “I think it’s more than a club.”\n\n\nDuring the pandemic, the club also became anti-mask and anti-vax — because conspiracy theories come in price-saving 3-packs, I guess? Poves resigned in late 2020 and the club was renamed and then purchased by a larger club to become their reserve team. The Earth remains round.\nTags: science   soccer   sports   video",

But Walnut eventually found a good match in bird keeper Chris Crowe, a 42 year-old human who she has bonded with. Crowe, as part of his duties at the zoo, has embraced his role as Walnut’s mate in order to inseminate her with semen from a male crane.\nThat summer, however, Crowe noticed that Walnut seemed interested in, well, him. When Crowe stopped by her yard, she would bow her head and raise her wings — motions that Crowe now recognizes as the first moves of a mating dance. “At first, I thought that she was just excited to see me,” Crowe says. “But then I’d see the other pairs doing the same things…",

          "description": "A pair of 1300-year-old skis has been discovered in an ice field in Norway. They are believed to be the best-preserved ancient skis ever found — even the bindings are mostly intact. The first of the pair was found back in 2014 and its mate was recently retrieved, an expedition you can witness in the video above.\nIt has been seven years since the discovery of the first ski at the Digervarden ice patch. We have patiently monitored the melt of the ice patch, in case the second ski of the pair should melt out. We were back in 2016 for a general survey of the ice patch, but the ice had not retreated much then. This year, we could see on satellite imagery that the ice patch had retreated compared to 2014. We decided to send out an archaeologist to check it.\n\n\nOne of the things they were hoping to find is how the skier was able to maintain forward motion with the skis, especially uphill. Modern cross-country skis rely on a texture (or wax) on the bottom of the ski to grip the snow while downhill skiers can apply skins to their skis to climb uphill. More than a thousand years ago, the choice was texture or animal fur:\nOne of the questions raised by the ski found in 2014 was if it originally had fur on the underside. This has major implications for the use of the ski. There were no nail holes along the sides of the 2014 ski which would have been a clear sign of the fastening of the fur. However, fur can also be glued to the underside, so we could not rule it out.\nA furrow on the underside along the length of the ski, as you find on other prehistoric skis (and on modern cross-country skis), would solve the question. Such a furrow would have no function with an underside covered by fur. The 2014 ski did not show a furrow, but the new and better preserved ski does! So, probably no fur-lining.\n\n\n(thx, meg)\nTags: archaeology   skiing   video",

          "description": "Even for mathematically minded folks, statistics can be hard to grasp. Take statistical paradoxes for example: Simpson’s Paradox is a real mind-boggler. Ryan Anderson explains this paradox in a recent issue of Why is this interesting?\nIt’s simple to describe, yet it still stops me in my tracks when I see it in the wild. The paradox is that a measurable effect on a large population disappears, or even reverses when that population is split into subgroups. The cause of these results is almost always a material change in the denominators from one period to the next.\nShowing is easier than telling with paradoxes, so here is a classic example: In 1995 and 1996, David Justice had a higher batting average than Derek Jeter in each year. However, Jeter had a higher cumulative batting average over those two years.\n\n\nIt’s true; look:\n\nAnderson continues:\nHow does this work? Jeter’s 1996 stats accounted for over 92% of his total performance over the two years, as he was 20 years old and only called up to the major league for a few games in 1995. Meanwhile, Justice’s 1996 stats were only 25% of his total performance due to a separated shoulder he suffered barely two months into the season. So while Justice performed better on smaller sample size, Jeter’s 183 hits in 1996 were the strongest signal for overall performance.\n\n\nRead the rest of the piece; he goes on to connect statistical paradoxes to efforts to mislead people about the pandemic and vaccine effectiveness.\nTags: baseball   mathematics   Ryan Anderson   sports",

This looks so much like small fires exploding into raging infernos and then dying down before flaring up all over again. Indeed, forest fire metaphors seem to be particularly useful in describing pandemics like this.\nThink of COVID-19 as a fire burning in a forest. All of us are trees. The R0 is the wind speed. The higher it is, the faster the fire tears through the forest. But just like a forest fire, COVID-19 needs fuel to keep going. We’re the fuel.\nIn other forest fire metaphorical scenarios, people are ‘kindling’, ‘sparks being thrown off’ (when infecting others) and ‘fuel’ (when becoming infected). In these cases, fire metaphors convey the dangers posed by people being in close proximity to one another, but without directly attributing blame: people are described as inanimate entities (trees, kindling, fuel) that are consumed by the fire they contribute to spread.\n\n\nSee also A Time Lapse World Map of Every Covid-19 Death (from July 2020).\nTags: Covid-19   death   infoviz   maps   time lapse   video",

They question why, for example, it differs from two contemporary copies made from Rubens’s original. The toes of Samson’s outstretched right foot, for example, are cropped in the National Gallery version, while they are shown in an engraving by Jacob Matham and a painting that depicts the Samson and Delilah hanging in Rockox’s home by Frans Francken the Younger.\n\n\n Tags: art   Peter Paul Rubens   video",

This video documents how they do it.\nThe Nenet reindeer herders need to move their tent every few days throughout most of the year. Every time they migrate they must pack the whole tent away, drag it across the tundra on sledges, and erect it again in a fresh place, sometimes in temperatures of minus thirty degrees. Survival depends on working together as a team.\nAfter staying in the wooded taiga for two months they start to migrate north following the ancient paths of migrating reindeer (caribou). In four months they will travel up to 1200km and must pack and move every three to five days to keep up with their herd. They must reach their summer quarters before the snows melt and flood great rivers with icy waters too cold and deep for the calves, born along the way, to cross.\n\n\nSee also How to Build an Igloo.

The US is throwing too little money at high-tech, ultimately private sector solutions but much of the problem comes down to our underfunded public health system and “profoundly unequal society”.\n“To be ready for the next pandemic, we need to make sure that there’s an even footing in our societal structures,” Seema Mohapatra, a health-law expert at Indiana University, told me. That vision of preparedness is closer to what 19th-century thinkers lobbied for, and what the 20th century swept aside. It means shifting the spotlight away from pathogens themselves and onto the living and working conditions that allow pathogens to flourish. It means measuring preparedness not just in terms of syringes, sequencers, and supply chains but also in terms of paid sick leave, safe public housing, eviction moratoriums, decarceration, food assistance, and universal health care. It means accompanying mandates for social distancing and the like with financial assistance for those who might lose work, or free accommodation where exposed people can quarantine from their family. It means rebuilding the health policies that Reagan began shredding in the 1980s and that later administrations further frayed. It means restoring trust in government and community through public services. “It’s very hard to achieve effective containment when the people you’re working with don’t think you care about them,” Arrianna Marie Planey, a medical geographer at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, told me.\n\n\n Tags: Covid-19   Ed Yong   healthcare   politics   science   USA",

Whatever you find there, you can keep. But what are they really searching for?\nI came across an article about the Crater of Diamonds State Park in Arkansas, which I learned is the world’s only public diamond-bearing site. People from all walks of life search for diamonds atop this ancient volcanic crater, and it’s finders keepers. Some people find substantial diamonds, some don’t, and either way, it takes a lot of digging in the dirt. I was immediately hooked on the metaphor of this place.\nI was interested in the hope of treasure, the grittiness of searching, and what people there were actually looking for in their lives. Creatively, I wanted to push an interview-driven piece, especially one in which subjects are given freedom to take you where they want to go, rather than guiding interviews along a plot-driven track. Errol Morris’ Vernon, Florida was a huge inspiration for this approach.\n\n\nThat loudspeaker announcement right at the beginning is surreal — a great way to set the tone for the rest of the film.\nTags: Caitlyn Greene   diamonds   video",

Steger lives off the grid and uses the harvested ice for refrigeration — the ice keeps everything cool in the ice house for the whole year, until the next harvest.\nBest known for his legendary polar explorations, Will Steger’s life work grew out of a single log cabin he built after moving to the Minnesotan wilderness at age 25. Reliant on sustainable energy and natural commodities, Steger formed a community and culture based on the principle of mutuality. Central to Steger’s operation is the lost art of cutting ice for refrigeration. This annual harvest formed a tradition spanning fifty years that became known as the “Ice Ball”. While this old world technology inevitably became obsolete, its disappearance parallels a concerning loss of social interdependence in modern society.\n\n\nCome for the ice harvesting, stay for the wonderful Minnesotan accents.

In the 1980s, scientists discovered a hole in the ozone layer that protects the Earth from UV radiation; further depletion would have caused major problems with the world’s food supply and an epidemic of skin cancer. Forty years later, we’ve virtually eliminated the chemicals causing the depletion and ozone losses have stabilized and have recently shown improvement.\nSo how did we do it?

          "description": "This is a lovely, almost poetic piece by Daniel Riley about the sport of freediving and one of the best freedivers in the world, Alexey Molchanov.\nFreediving is, after all, a lifelong opportunity to radically reshape one’s body and mind in the process. In pursuing depth, humans must train their lungs and brains to unlock secret sources of clarity and strength and oxygen and potential that are hidden within the body. They are secrets that, once revealed, make the divers not just more effective at their craft, they argue, but more effective, conscious, skillful, and thoughtful as human beings. There is a shift in perspective. A global realignment within one’s consciousness. The look in their eyes when they talk about this thing…every diver who’s gone truly deep sounds like those rarest of in…",

          "description": "For the next two weeks, L’Arc de Triomphe in Paris will be wrapped, an installation that realizes a project begun by the late husband and wife team Christo and Jeanne-Claude in 1961.\nL’Arc de Triomphe, Wrapped, a temporary artwork for Paris, is on view for 16 days from Saturday, September 18 to Sunday, October 3, 2021. The project has been realized in partnership with the Centre des Monuments Nationaux and in coordination with the City of Paris. It also receives the support of the Centre Pompidou. The Arc de Triomphe is wrapped in 25,000 square meters of recyclable polypropylene fabric in silvery blue, and with 3,000 meters of red rope.\nIn 1961, three years after they met in Paris, Christo and Jeanne-Claude began creating works of art in public spaces. One of their projects was to wrap a public building. When he arrived in Paris, Christo rented a small room near the Arc de Triomphe and had been attracted by the monument ever since. In 1962, he made a photomontage of the Arc de Triomphe wrapped, seen from the Avenue Foch and, in 1988, a collage. 60 years later, the project will finally be concretized.\n\n\nJeanne-Claude died in 2009 and Christo followed in 2020, so the project was completed by their team according to their wishes. I would have liked to have seen this in person…The Gates in NYC were wonderful.\nTags: art   Christo   Paris",

But what about the colors? The moon is gray, of course, but not *perfectly* gray. Some areas have a subtle blue tint, and others have a more orange tint. By teasing out those subtle colors, I can reveal the mineral composition of the moon! Blues denote titanium presence, while orange shows iron and feldspar present in the regolith.

          "description": "If you’re talking about the origins of rock & roll, Sister Rosetta Tharpe has to be included in those conversations. Her early fusion of gospel, the blues, and the electric guitar (as on 1944’s Strange Things Happening Every Day, a contender for the first rock & roll record) had a huge influence on men like Little Richard, Chuck Berry, and Elvis Presley, who ended up winning much of the credit for this innovation. This 60-minute BBC documentary from 2011 is a good place to start learning about Tharpe — part 1 is embedded above and here are parts two, three, and four.\nI found this via Ted Mills at Open Culture, who writes:\nAs the doc makes clear, Tharpe had a rebellious streak, didn’t do what she was told, and pushed boundaries in a very segregated America. She invited the all-white Jordanaires to tour with her, surprising house managers and booking agents alike. And she carried on a love affair and creative partnership with fellow gospel singer Marie Knight for decades, very much on the down low.\nSo perhaps this is the reason Tharpe has not been on our collective radar — we’ve been slow to admit that rock guitar was created by a queer black woman devoted to the Lord.\n\n\nAnd if you want to see the whole clip of Tharpe performing Didn’t It Rain from the opening scene of the documentary, there’s really not a better way to spend eight minutes (bc you’ll probably want to watch it twice):\n\nDamn.\nTags: music   Rosetta Tharpe   video",

It shut down about 80 percent of the abortion services we provide. Anyone who suspects I have violated the new law can sue me for at least $10,000. They could also sue anybody who helps a person obtain an abortion past the new limit, including, apparently, the driver who brings a patient to my clinic.\nFor me, it is 1972 all over again.\nAnd that is why, on the morning of Sept. 6, I provided an abortion to a woman who, though still in her first trimester, was beyond the state’s new limit. I acted because I had a duty of care to this patient, as I do for all patients, and because she has a fundamental right to receive this care.\nI fully understood that there could be legal consequences — but I wanted to make sure that Texas didn’t get away with its bid to prevent this blatantly unconstitutional law from being tested.\n\n\nBraid concluded his piece: “I believe abortion is an essential part of health care.” Absolutely.\nTags: abortion   Alan Braid   medicine   politics   Texas",

The general rumor is this will be an announcement of new MacBook Pros with faster M1 based processors.\nThat'd be great, but what I really want is some sort of M1/M1X/M2 based iMac Pro with a big display. It's been a while since I've bought a new desktop (I'm still rocking a late 2015 iMac for some reason), and I'm eager for something newer and faster. Hopefully we'll also get a release day for MacOS Monterey.\nOne thing that I haven't seen remarked upon much, is that it's been few weeks since a new beta of Xcode 13 dropped with a Monterey SDK to build against. This makes me think that there will be new APIs for dealing with some sort of new hardware in whatever is coming out Monday. So whatever we're getting, I bet it's going to be a little more involed than just a standard hardware upgrade.",

I’m feeling my way to that destination, which is years off, surely, and I just hope to manage it gracefully. (I don’t know of any role models with this.)\nAnyway.

Some players just work better together than others and it might not even be a skill level thing; just a general and innate understanding of what the other dude is going to do with the puck, without the puck, on the forecheck, in all three zones — it’s just a thing.\nFor the Philadelphia Flyers’ newest top-pairing defenseman Ryan Ellis, he views chemistry as being best friends off the ice, and when talking about his new partner Ivan Provorov, he’s attemptin…",

[The Athletic]\n*Ryan Ellis hasn’t played a single game in the Metropolitan Division yet and he’s already figuring to be one of the best defenseman in it. [Pensburgh]\n*The league says it will be cracking down on cross-checking this season. Going to be interesting to see how that goes. [ProHockeyTalk]\n*And finally, our 25 Under 25 wrapped up with number one Carter Hart, which likely surprised no one and yet probably annoyed some folks anyway. We hope you all had fun with it!

          "description": "Photo by Joshua Sarner/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n    \n\n  \nSuddenly, everything is happening. \n Just like that, training camp is upon us! The Flyers are set to be back on the ice starting on Thursday. We’ll see them broken up into three groups for regular on-ice sessions for the first three days of camp, and then they’ll add a couple of scrimmages on top of those sessions on Sunday and Monday, ahead of Tuesday’s preseason kickoff against the Islanders. \nYou can find the full schedule for here, and the full roster for camp can be found here. \nThe Flyers have also announced the following injury updates:\nKevin Hayes (abdominal surgery on 9/21 - out 6-8 weeks)\nSamuel Morin (right knee surgery to have loose bodies removed on 9/10 - out 6-8 weeks)\nWade Allison (right ankle sprain - out indefinitely)\nZayde Wisdom (shoulder surgery - out indefinitely)\nCooper Zech (upper body - out 6-8 weeks)\nNot all of this is surprising: we knew that Wisdom would be out for a while, and there had been rumors about Morin’s status kicking around for the last little bit here. But there are a few takeaways. The ankle injury for Allison is still not great, but considering how ugly the play he was injured on looked, and the knee issues he’s had in the past, an ankle injury feels like a bit of a bullet dodged, all things considered. \nThe Hayes news is the big surprise, and that certainly complicates things. The Flyers’ center situation heading into camp already looked to be a bit up in the air, and a lot was going to depend on those battles in camp to solidify those positions, and now they seem to be even more wide open. With Hayes out (and to a degree, Allison as well) this certainly opens up the door for some prospects like Morgan Frost and Tanner Laczynski, who have been impressing in development and rookie camps, to push hard for a spot, and reasonably grab one. \nThings are getting really interesting around here, and while it feels like we say this every year, this camp is going to be one to keep an eye on.",

All of these towns are electing members to their town councils or boards of commissioners. Some are also electing mayors. A handful have bond referendum questions on the ballot, too.

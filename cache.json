          "description": "The iPhone 14 won't rely entirely on a hole-punch cutout to house the TrueDepth camera system, possibly meaning Apple may retain the notch alongside a hole-punch design, according to a new rumor from Weibo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has reported that for at least the high-end 2022 iPhone models, Apple will use a hole-punch design, similar to those of some flagship Android smartphones. Following Kuo's report, Apple leaker Jon Prosser shared renders of what he claims to be the design of the ‌iPhone 14‌. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEven if the ‌iPhone 14‌ introduces a hole-punch design, it will be hard for Apple to abandon the notch altogether, according to a now-deleted post on Weibo from @PandaIsBald. The account, which accurately predicted that the ninth-generation iPad would be announced at the September Apple event, claimed that it is \"unlikely\" that Apple will replace the notch entirely with a hole-punch cutout, and instead, the ‌iPhone 14‌ may continue to feature a notch but with a smaller footprint. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro, Apple did make the notch smaller in width but slightly taller. Apple did this by shrinking the component sizes of the TrueDepth camera system and reengineering the internals. Apple this year also moved the earpiece to the top of the bezel, freeing up space in the notch. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReporting on a hole-punch design for next year, Apple analyst ‌Ming-Chi Kuo‌ did not provide details on how Apple will house Face ID on the high-end ‌iPhone 14‌ models if it uses a hole-punch design. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nToday's rumor from Weibo claims that Touch ID will not be making an appearance under the display next year, meaning Face ID may continue to be the only biometric authentication option available to ‌iPhone 14‌ users. \nRelated Roundup: iPhone 14\nThis article, \"iPhone 14 Unlikely to Rely on Hole-Punch Design Entirely and May Keep Notch, No Under-Screen Touch ID, Leaker Claims\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "A bug in iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 is preventing Safari from loading AMP links for Google search results, but the issue is not intentional and Google is preparing a fix that's set to be released in the near future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDeveloper Jeff Johnson today published a blog post speculating on whether Google had intentionally disabled AMP links for Google search results in Safari on devices running ‌iOS 15‌ (via MacStories) after he noticed their disappearance. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs he noted, Safari's Google search results do not include AMP links on devices running ‌iOS 15‌, but AMP content still loads in iOS 14 and in other browsers like Chrome for iOS. Johnson wondered whether Google had decided to disable AMP in ‌iOS 15‌ due to the prevalence of Safari extensions that feature AMP-blocking features.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nIt's a bug specific to iOS 15 that we're working on. We expect it will be resolved soon.\n— Danny Sullivan (@dannysullivan) October 6, 2021\n \n\r\n\r\nThat Google search results do not include AMP links in the Safari browser on ‌iOS 15‌ is a bug, according to Google's public search liaison Danny Sullivan. In a tweet, Sullivan said that Google is working on a fix and that the issue should be resolved soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor those unfamiliar with AMP, it stands for \"Accelerated Mobile Pages\" and it is a feature that's designed to make webpages load faster on mobile devices. AMP pages are cached, allowing them to be presented to users more quickly, but it's something that is not always popular with users because some website features are disabled when AMP is used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Google does re-implement AMP links, iOS 15 Safari extensions like Amplosion are available to redirect AMP links to standard webpages.\nRelated Roundups: iOS 15, iPadOS 15\nTags: Google, Safari\nRelated Forum: iOS 15\nThis article, \"Google to Fix Bug That Disables Safari AMP Search Results on iOS 15 Devices\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "iPhone 13 Pro models feature an upgraded Ultra Wide camera with autofocus that enables macro photography, allowing users to take close-up photos of flowers, insects, and other objects that are as close as 2cm to the camera lens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple's Macro Mode is limited to iPhone 13 Pro models, but those with older iPhones can now get in on the action, as Halide today announced that it has updated its popular third-party camera app with its own Macro Mode, with no accessories required. The feature is available on all iPhones with a Neural Engine, including the iPhone 8 and newer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHalide said its Macro Mode first checks which one of your iPhone's camera lenses can focus the closest and switches to it. Then, the feature provides ultra-precise focus control down to the sub-millimeter to ensure the photo looks sharp. Finally, an AI-based feature called Neural Macro further enhances close-up details of the photo once shot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nHalide's sample photo shot with its Macro Mode on iPhone 12 Pro\n\r\n\r\nIf you already have an iPhone 13 Pro model, Halide said its Macro Mode essentially stacks on top of Apple's Macro Mode, resulting in \"staggeringly close, microscope-like shots that are even more highly magnified.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo turn on Macro Mode in the Halide app, first tap the AF button to get into manual focus, and then tap the flower button. The feature is available as a free update for all existing users, with version 2.5 of the app rolling out on the App Store today. For new users, the Halide app is priced at $2.99 per month or $11.99 per year, or $49.99 as a one-time purchase.  \nTag: Halide\nThis article, \"Halide's New Macro Mode Lets You Take Close-Up Photos Without an iPhone 13 Pro\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

On Android devices, multiple payment services can offer contactless payments using the NFC chip, but on the ‌iPhone‌, no rival services are allowed to leverage the NFC hardware.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Commission's preliminary concerns also reportedly include Apple's terms and conditions on how ‌Apple Pay‌ should be used in merchants' apps and on websites. Concerns may have been raised by ‌Apple Pay‌'s wide reach and better user experience on the ‌iPhone‌ compared to other services, and accelerated by the growth of contactless payments during the global health crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe EU competition enforcer is now believed to be preparing a statement of objections to charge Apple with anticompetitive conduct, which is expected to be sent to the company next year. The antitrust charge could put Apple at risk of a large fine and force it to open the NFC chip to rival payment systems in Europe. Similar investigations have also been opened in Australia.\nRelated Roundup: Apple Pay\nTags: European Union, European Commission, NFC, Europe\nRelated Forum: Apple Music, Apple Pay/Card, iCloud, Fitness+\nThis article, \"EU Plans to Hit Apple With Antitrust Charges Over Apple Pay\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

There are eight colors to choose from, and the line below the tab can be customized to be between 1 and 7 pixels wide. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Zhenyi notes, the extension works best with the \"Separate\" tab layout selected and \"Show color in tab bar\" disabled in the Tab section of Safari's Preferences. Zhenyi also cautions that ActiveTab will not work reliably if you have so many tabs in a window that the tab bar becomes scrollable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActiveTab is available for $1.99 on the Mac App Store, with no in-app purchases, no ads, and no tracking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(H/T MacStories.)\nTag: Safari\nThis article, \"Safari 15 Extension for Mac Helps You Tell Which Tab Is Active\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Those fees account for most of the revenue that Apple makes from its digital wallet, according to people familiar with the matter.\nAside from the fee arrangement, Apple garnered several other concessions from credit card issuers as it rolled out ‌Apple Pay‌, and in exchange, Apple agreed not to launch its own credit card network to go up against Visa and Mastercard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the launch of Apple Card in partnership with Goldman Sachs, Apple has become more of a direct competitor to other banks, and some bank executives have reportedly been angered by Apple's move and are seeking ways to reduce the payments they make to Apple.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple has unsurprisingly informed Visa that it objects to the proposed change that would reduce the fees it receives on recurring transactions, so it remains to be seen whether Visa will follow through on its plans, which are scheduled to go into effect next year.\nRelated Roundup: Apple Pay\nTags: wsj.com, Visa\nRelated Forum: Apple Music, Apple Pay/Card, iCloud, Fitness+\nThis article, \"Banks Pressuring Visa to Cut Back on Apple Pay Fees\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The sight of something beautiful — a wooded hillside, a well‑made object — recalls his spirit to us. Even in his years of suffering, he never lost his faith in the beauty of existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMemory is inadequate for what is in our hearts: we miss him profoundly. We were blessed to have him as husband and father.\nAlso in commemoration, Apple's former design chief Jony Ive has penned a remembrance of his friend and colleague for the Wall Street Journal Magazine.\nTag: Steve Jobs\nThis article, \"Apple Commemorates 10th Anniversary of Steve Jobs' Passing\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Safari 15's controversial new design on the Mac has led to complaints about the way the browser indicates which tab is active.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs illustrated by Daring Fireball's John Gruber, there was never any ambiguity about which tab is active in previous versions of Safari, as an active tab is shown with lighter shading that matches the browser's toolbar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Safari 15, however, tabs have a new button-like design with a rounder and more defined appearance. Apple has also inverted its shading of tabs, with an active tab now having darker shading and inactive tabs having lighter shading. The change has annoyed Gruber and other users, as evidenced by this Reddit thread with nearly 1,000 upvotes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The design is counterintuitive,\" wrote Gruber. \"What sense does it make that no matter your settings, the active tab is rendered with less contrast between the tab title and the background than background tabs? The active tab should be the one that pops.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a Safari 15 window with two tabs open, especially from the same website, Gruber said determining which tab is active is basically a guessing game. Gruber acknowledged that it is easier to discern the active tab when more than two tabs are open, but he said the confusion with exactly two tabs should have been reason enough to scrap the design change.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I can't tell you how many times I closed the tab that I needed because of this,\" one Reddit user expressed in frustration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for users who do not like the new design, Apple has not made any changes to the shading of tabs in either the Safari 15.1 beta or the latest version of the experimental Safari Technology Preview browser.\nTag: Safari\nThis article, \"Safari 15 Users Say New Tab Design is Counterintuitive\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Till now, there's been some unknown about whether Apple will stick with its November or October timeframe for this year. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his latest Power On newsletter, Gurman says the company is poised to announce M1X powered MacBook Pros within the next month, noting that \"Apple typically does its major new Mac introductions in October. So stay tuned.\" In the paywalled section of the newsletter, Gurman also reiterated what we can expect performance-wise from the new machines. \r\n\r\nThe Apple M1X chip, the likely name for a more graphics-intense and professional-focused M1 chip, is indeed still on tap for 2021. We'll likely see it show up first in a new range of MacBook Pros in the next month and a higher-end Mac mini at some point. The M1X has been developed in two variations: both with 10 CPU cores (eight high-performance and two high-efficiency) and either 16 or 32 graphics cores.\nPrevious report suggests that alongside the new MacBook Pros, Apple may also announce a redesigned Mac mini.

The poster of the photos claimed that they are working for a carrier who was testing the Series 7 before it officially goes on sale \"later this fall.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe've so far only seen the Series 7 in Apple's marketing and promotional materials, and the company has yet to announce a date for when it will be available for purchase. The images shared today offer us our first hands-on look at the Series 7 with its larger and more expansive display. Despite rumors, the Series 7 does not feature flat-edges but instead \"more rounded and softer corners,\" which allows the display to curve slightly over the sides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe larger display is one of just a few design changes for the Series 7 compared to the previous generation. The Series 7 features an improved IP6X rating for dust and water resistance but internally maintains the same CPU as the Apple Watch Series 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile there certainly could be more internal changes for the Series 7, we'll have to wait until we get our hands on the watch itself to learn about them.

          "description": "Apple has canceled its plans to release an updated iPad Air with an OLED display next year due to concerns around quality and costs, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said today in an investor note obtained by MacRumors. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn March, Kuo reported that Apple had an ‌iPad Air‌ with an OLED display in the pipeline for next year. Today, Kuo has revised his prediction, saying that will not be the case since Apple has canceled those plans due to costs and performance not meeting the company's expectations. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKuo had previously stated that the 11-inch iPad Pro would be receiving a mini-LED display next year, and Kuo today doubled down on that claim by saying it will be the \"focus of [the] iPad line in 2022.\" Currently, only the 12.9-inch iPad Pro includes the newer mini-LED technology. One reason Kuo states that Apple had canceled its OLED ‌iPad Air‌ is that it may have been detrimental to the sales of the forthcoming 11-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ with a mini-LED display. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Apple plans to stick with an LCD display for the ‌iPad Air‌, Kuo says the company continues to research and develop newer display technologies for the ‌iPad‌ line. A report last week suggested that Apple and Samsung had abandoned their joint plans to develop an OLED display for a forthcoming updated 10.9-inch ‌iPad Air‌. \nRelated Roundup: iPad Air \nTag: Ming-Chi Kuo\nBuyer's Guide: iPad Air (Neutral)\nRelated Forum: iPad\nThis article, \"Kuo: Apple Cancels Plans to Release iPad Air With OLED Display in 2022, Plans to Stick With LCD Technology\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

While that did not happen, the new ‌AirPods‌ are rumored to already be in mass production, and Apple is seemingly gearing up to launch them before the end of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new ‌AirPods‌ will be the first significant update to the ‌AirPods‌ lineup since the AirPods Pro three years ago. The new ‌AirPods‌ are expected to feature an updated design that takes inspiration from the higher-end ‌AirPods Pro‌ but lacking in \"Pro\" features. Rumors are unclear on whether the new ‌AirPods‌ will feature silicone ear tips or not, as leaked images and renders depict both possibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple announced its ‌AirPods Pro‌ via a press release in 2019, and besides their initial announcement on stage in 2016, ‌AirPods‌ have not yet been given dedicated airtime during an Apple event. Apple could announce the new third-generation ‌AirPods‌ via a press release in the coming weeks, or alternatively include them in its rumored second event for the fall, expected to take place later this month or in November. \nRelated Roundup: AirPods\nTag: AirPods 3\nBuyer's Guide: AirPods (Don't Buy)\nRelated Forum: AirPods\nThis article, \"Third-Generation AirPods Still Rumored to Be on Track for 2021 Launch\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "iOS 15 adoption has reached an estimated 19.3% since the software update was released September 20, according to mobile analytics company Mixpanel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMixpanel measures iOS adoption based on visits to websites and apps that use its mobile analytics SDKs, so the data is not official. Apple has yet to share iOS 15 adoption stats, having last reported an 85% adoption rate for iOS 14 back in June.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\niOS 15 adoption appears to remain slower than iOS 14 adoption so far, and there are likely several reasons for that, including Apple providing iOS 14 users with the option to continue receiving important security updates, several iOS 15 features being delayed, and iOS 15 suffering from a handful of early bugs that still need to be fixed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, Apple said an issue preventing some iPhone 13 users from using the Unlock with Apple Watch feature will be fixed in an upcoming software update. The feature is designed to let you unlock your iPhone while wearing a mask, but some users have encountered an \"Unable to Communicate with Apple Watch\" error message.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere's another iOS 15 bug where performing an iCloud Backup can result in photos saved from an iMessage conversation that is later deleted to disappear from the Photos app, intermittent touchscreen issues on iPhone 13 models, and other problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple is currently beta testing iOS 15.1, which includes a fix for the Unlock with Apple Watch bug at a minimum, but there is no timeframe for the software update's release. It's quite possible that Apple will opt to release a smaller update such as iOS 15.0.1 to more quickly address some of the bugs and security vulnerabilities that have surfaced.\nRelated Roundups: iOS 15, iPadOS 15\nTag: Mixpanel\nRelated Forum: iOS 15\nThis article, \"iOS 15 Suffering From Several Bugs as Adoption Rises to Nearly 20%\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

At the time of writing, the Podcasts app, which has faced a flurry of criticism, has a 2 out of 5-star rating out of 156 reviews, with other Apple apps varying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPresently, no Apple app has a perfect five-star rating, with even the company's built-in Stocks app struggling to reach a 4 out of 5 grade. Notes has earned just 3.6 out of 5, while even Maps, which has received more attention from Apple over the years, has only a 3 out of 5 ratings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy opening up its apps to ratings and reviews, Apple and its teams are now better able to receive more direct feedback for individual apps on ‌‌iPhone‌‌ and iPad. In light of recent ‌App Store‌ litigation, this move also nixes a potential criticism from Apple's detractors, who could have previously argued that by withholding ratings and reviews for pre-installed apps, Apple was being anti-competitive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple's pre-installed apps, such as Mail, Podcasts, and Maps, don't receive regular ‌App Store‌ feature updates as other apps do; instead, their major updates are bundled with significant iOS releases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple refines and tweaks all of its apps with each minor update for iOS and iPadOS, but significant changes, such as the ones that are likely to be requested through ratings and reviews, are not expected to come sporadically throughout the year, but instead, users will have to wait for the next major iOS release to see if their wishes have come true.\nTag: App Store\nThis article, \"Apple Now Lets Customers Rate and Review Pre-Installed Apps on the App Store\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Facebook today announced that it's bringing Reels, its short-form videos that were previously only available on the Instagram platform, to its main Facebook app on iOS and Android in the United States. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the two share the same name and style, Reels content on Instagram and Facebook will differ. Facebook says it is testing the ability for Instagram Reels content creators to share their Reels to the Facebook audience, but doing so is entirely in a creator's control. Reels on Facebook can consist of effects, text, music, and more. Facebook's concept of Reels is wholly inspired by TikTok and follows its lead in featuring short, \"entertaining,\" and trend-making videos. \nWith the ability to create reels and have their Instagram reels suggested to people on Facebook, creators — whether they’re just starting out or already have a large following — will have more ways to express themselves, grow their communities and reach new audiences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReels on Facebook can consist of music, audio, effects, and more. You can find them in News Feed or in Groups, and when viewing a reel on Facebook, you can easily follow the creator directly from the video, like and comment on it, or share it with friends.\nFacebook also today announced it would be offering a new bonus program for content creators in hopes of spurring-up more Reels content on its platform. Reels in Facebook will be available starting today in the United States on iOS and Android.\nTag: Facebook\nThis article, \"TikTok-Inspired 'Reels' Videos Are Coming to Facebook in the U.S. on iOS\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Apple and Google have been asked to provide compliance plans for a newly amended law in South Korea that bars both tech giants from forcing developers to using their in-app purchase payment system for their respective app distribution platforms, Reuters reports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn August, South Korea passed an amendment to an existing law that bans Apple and Google from mandating developers to use their own proprietary in-app purchasing system. Apple's in-app purchasing system gives the company a 15 to 30% commission for all purchases made and has been a hot topic for Apple and the discussion around the App Store for some time. Under the new law in South Korea, which is yet to go into effect, Apple and Google will be required to allow developers to use third-party payment methods within their app. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple has in recent weeks made some concessions to its ‌App Store‌ policy, most notably pivoting to allow developers to add links in their apps to external websites where purchases can be made. Those concessions come short of the mandate created by South Korea, which permits developers to add third-party payment methods directly within their app. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple has continued to call its in-app purchasing system the most trusted and safest way for customers to make purchases. Still, in light of recent decisions in its lawsuit against Epic Games, the Cupertino tech giant is being forced to rethink its model. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple operates the ‌App Store‌ under a single set of policies worldwide, and while the law passed in South Korea pertains to South Korean users, it will undoubtedly play a domino effect across the globe. With the mid-October deadline now set in South Korea for Apple and Google, we'll likely see how this decision could have repercussions around the world for Apple users soon. \nTags: App Store, South Korea\nThis article, \"Apple and Google Given Mid-October Deadline in South Korea for Filing Plans to Allow Outside Payment Systems in Apps\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Likewise, there's no way of knowing if the feature would be available on all Macs or be exclusive to certain models, such as the upcoming 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models rumored to drop this fall.

The post implies that customers should possibly consider replacing some of Apple's default iOS apps, such as Photos, Safari, Calendar, Reminders, and even Phone, with Google's equivalent of those apps, including Google ‌Photos‌, Google Chrome, Google Calendar, Google Tasks, and Google Voice, respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGoogle continued to encourage customers to utilize the wide variety of ‌widgets‌ its iOS apps offer. Google said that if the right Google ‌widgets‌ are placed on the home screen, users will \"never even have to leave\" their home screens to stay caught up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the blog post, users can also use \"Smart Stacks\" to stack different Google ‌widgets‌ on top of each other, allowing iOS to determine which widget is most relevant to show at any one time. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, Google recommends that users replace Safari with Google Chrome as the default iOS browser, allowing all system-wide links and Spotlight web suggestions to open in Chrome. Google closed by saying it hopes ‌iPhone 13‌ users, who just started receiving their new iPhones last week, will consider bringing \"the best of Google\" to their device instead of just simply purchasing an Android smartphone or device.\nTags: Google, Android\nThis article, \"Google Basically Wants Your iPhone 13 Home Screen to Look Like Android\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Apple today increased the price of its Beats Flex headphones from $49.99 to $69.99, a pricing shift that may be related to supply chain constraints that have raised the costs of components across the industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst released last October, the Beats Flex made headlines at launch because of their low price compared to other Apple headphone options, and they have been a popular purchase option since. The Beats Flex are a follow-up to the BeatsX, and feature an in-ear design with a wire between the left and right earbuds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiven their low price, the Beats Flex may have been more susceptible to cost pressures than some other Apple products. At $20 more expensive, the Beats Flex are still a very affordable option to get into the Apple headphone ecosystem, but it's not quite as impressive a deal as before. They come in Black, Flame Blue, Yuzu Yellow, and Smoke Gray, and offer much of the same seamless connectivity functionality available with Apple's more expensive Beats options.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAuto-play/pause is included, and the Beats Flex last for up to 12 hours without needing to be recharged. There's a Fast Fuel charging option that offers 1.5 hours of playback, and they feature Find My integration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pricing change of the Beats Flex was first noticed by Twitter user Pedro Henrique and was highlighted by 9to5Mac. The Beats Flex can be purchased from the Apple Store, but Amazon currently has them on sale for as low as $37, so those considering a purchase should buy them on Amazon before prices go up.\nTags: Beats, W1, Beats Flex\nThis article, \"Apple Increases Price of Beats Flex Headphones From $50 to $70\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Those users are advised to update for a possible patch and improved security. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Spotify is being held as the main culprit for the excessive drainage, it could also be a bug in ‌iOS 15‌ for some users. ‌iOS 15‌ has been littered with multiple bugs, including one limiting Apple Watch functionality with the just-released iPhone 13, issues with Apple Music, and other bugs that Apple has promised fixes for.

Apple has now provided clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple told MacRumors that all third-party apps can take full advantage of 120Hz ProMotion refresh rates, but developers will need to declare that their apps use higher frame rates by adding an entry to their app's plist. Documentation on the required plist entry will be made available to developers soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple is requiring this opt-in step to provide higher fresh rates only to apps that will benefit from the technology, which will optimize battery life on iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max devices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is also a bug that is af…",

The Pickup Zone is a permanent installation within the store, featuring a dedicated table where customers can get their new devices from employees and more interestingly, a wall of built-in drawers where all the pickup orders are housed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn most Apple retail locations, employees must go to the back to retrieve orders that have been placed for in-store pickup, but that won't be the case with Apple The Mall at Bay Plaza, and it is the first store with this setup rather than a Forum area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlong with the Pickup Zone, the store also features an area with round tables for training, and a series of Forum displays. There are leather seats along the walls for those waiting for Genius Bar appointments, and the front of the store is outfitted with sliding glass doors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMake sure to check out the full store walkthrough to get a feel for the new design.\nTag: Apple Store\nThis article, \"New York City's Newest Apple Store Features Dedicated Pickup Zone\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The two Pro models also feature a ProMotion display with a variable refresh rate up to 120Hz, up to 1TB of storage, and additional camera features like Night mode portraits and ProRes video recording.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the United States, starting prices are the same as they were for the iPhone 12 lineup, including $699 for the iPhone 13 mini, $799 for the iPhone 13, $999 for the iPhone 13 Pro, and $1,099 for the iPhone 13 Pro Max.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sixth-generation iPad mini and ninth-generation iPad are also available for same-day pickup at select Apple Stores starting today.\nRelated Roundups: iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro\nBuyer's Guide: iPhone 13 (Buy Now), iPhone 13 Pro (Buy Now)\nRelated Forum: iPhone\nThis article, \"iPhone 13 Launch Day Underway With Same-Day Pickup Available at Select Apple Stores\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Apple has yet to share iOS 15 adoption stats, having last reported an 85% adoption rate for iOS 14 back in June.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEarlier this year, Apple announced that iPhone users who remain on iOS 14 now have the option to continue receiving important security updates, so this change is likely contributing to iOS 15's lower adoption rate seen by Mixpanel so far.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdating to iOS 15?

Most variants are available in 4-6 weeks, with 3-4 weeks being the earliest delivery estimate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs with every Apple product launch, it is possible that lengthy delivery estimates are a result of low supply rather than high demand. However, the ‌iPad mini‌ was arguably the standout product in Apple's event, thanks to its 8.3-inch display and chassis redesign in the vein of the iPad Air. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new ‌iPad mini‌ is also the only iPad with Apple's latest A15 Bionic chip, and like the iPad Pro, includes a 12-megapixel Ultra Wide front camera enabling Center Stage, so there's good reason for ‌iPad mini‌ fans to be excited again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReview embargos for the ‌iPad mini 6‌ lift later today, so be sure to check back here on MacRumors for a full reviews roundup.\nRelated Roundup: iPad mini\nBuyer's Guide: iPad Mini (Buy Now)\nRelated Forum: iPad\nThis article, \"Most iPad Mini 6 Shipping Estimates Now Extend into November\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "In iOS 15 as well as Safari 15 for macOS Big Sur and macOS Catalina, Apple introduced some Safari interface design changes that haven't been universally welcomed. Fortunately, Apple has made some of these changes optional, such as the ability to disable tab bar coloring. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nTab bar coloring on (left) versus coloring off (right) in dark mode\n\r\n\r\nTab bar coloring, or website tinting, happens when the color of Safari's interface changes around the tabs, bookmark, and navigation button areas to match the color of the website you're viewing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe idea behind tinting is that it allows the browser interface to fade into the background and create a more immersive experience. However, the effect doesn't always look great, especially if you have several windows arranged on your desktop. Happily, Apple chose to include an option to turn it off.\r\n\r\n\nLaunch Safari, then select Safari -> Preferences... from the menu bar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSelect the Tabs panel.\n\r\n\r\nUncheck the box next to Show color in tab bar.\r\n\r\n\nIf you're using Safari in ‌iOS 15‌, you can find the same option in Settings -> Safari. Under the \"Tabs\" section, turn off the switch next to Allow Website Tinting. On iPadOS 15, this option is called Show Color in Tab Bar, just like in Safari 15 for macOS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn previous versions of iOS, Apple included a \"Show Color in Tab Bar\" accessibility setting, which basically had the same effect as the new \"Allow Website Tinting\" toggle. The fact that Apple made the option more prominent suggests user aversion to tinting is more common than previously thought. \nRelated Roundups: macOS Big Sur, macOS Monterey\nTag: Safari\nRelated Forums: macOS Catalina, macOS Big Sur, macOS Monterey\nThis article, \"How to Turn Off Tab Bar Coloring / Tinting in Safari\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The new updates reintroduce features like SharePlay, and below, we have a list of what's new.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSharePlay\n\r\n\r\nSharePlay is enabled in the iOS 15.1, iPadOS 15.1, and tvOS 15.1 betas to allow Apple to further work out bugs to get the feature ready to launch. Apple decided to pull SharePlay from the ‌iOS 15‌ launch because it was not properly functioning and was still riddled with issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAvailable in FaceTime, SharePlay is designed to let users call up their friends and family and then watch TV, watch movies, and listen to music together using neat features like shared playlists and TV show syncing for all users. SharePlay also allows for screen sharing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf testing goes well, SharePlay could see an official launch in iOS 15.1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnounce Calls\n\r\n\r\nIn the Settings for the Phone app, there's a new icon for the \"Announce Calls\" setting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLossless Audio for HomePod\n\r\n\r\nThe HomePod 15.1 beta that accompanies the iOS 15.1 beta adds Lossless Audio and Dolby Atmos with Spatial Audio support to the HomePod and HomePod mini.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVaccine Cards in Wallet\n\r\n\r\nIn ‌iOS 15‌, verifiable health records can be downloaded and stored in the Health app, and this includes COVID-19 vaccination records and health results. In iOS 15.1, vaccination records are able to be added to the Wallet app so a vaccine card can be provided to businesses, restaurants, venues, and more where vaccines are required for entry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSee our previous article for more details and discussion. Discussion should be limited to the ‌iOS 15‌ update and political comments will be immediately removed. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Features\n\r\n\r\nKnow of a feature that we left out?

          "description": "The iOS 15.1 beta that was introduced today allows iPhone users to upload their COVID-19 vaccination status to the Health app and then generate a vaccination card in Apple Wallet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Apple Wallet vaccination card can be shown to businesses, venues, restaurants, and more that are requiring vaccines for entry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs outlined in an announcement to developers, verifiable health records are based on the SMART Health Cards specification. California is using SMART Health Cards, so users in California can add their vaccination records to the Wallet app after installing iOS 15.1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther states and health organizations that use the SMART Health Cards will be able to use a button to let users know that they can download and store their vaccination information in the Health app and in the Wallet app. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCalifornia, Louisiana, New York, Virginia, Hawaii, and some Maryland counties support Smart Health Cards, as do Walmart, Sam's Club, and CVS Health. So those in the specific supported states should be able to look up their information in state databases, but those who were vaccinated through companies like Walmart and CVS will also be able to add their information to the Health and Wallet apps because it's the same system. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that some apps like the one used by the NHS in the UK allowed users to add their vaccination records to the Wallet app, but the new solution is a universal standard that will work for all healthcare providers/states that implement it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscussion should be limited to the app and implementation, and not politics.\nRelated Roundups: iOS 15, iPadOS 15\nTag: COVID-19 Coronavirus\nRelated Forum: iOS 15\nThis article, \"iOS 15.1 Beta Lets Users Add COVID Vaccination Card to Wallet App\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

While Apple has long offered iPads and Macs in its Canadian refurbished store, this is the first time customers in the country have been able to benefit from the discounts that come with buying an Apple refurbished smartphone. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreviously, customers in Canada who wanted lower prices on iPhones had to wait for third-party deals or purchase refurbished/used devices from a third-party retailer, but with Apple's highly regarded refurbishment process now an option for iPhones too, this should come as a welcome development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll of Apple's refurbished products, ‌iPhone‌ included, are tested, certified, cleaned, and guaranteed with a one-year warranty. iPhones also feature a brand new battery and a fresh outer shell, ensuring there are no scratches or other cosmetic damage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCustomers in Canada can currently choose from a variety of refurbished recent ‌iPhone‌ models in various finishes and capacities, including ‌iPhone‌ XS, XS Max, 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max, with up to CAD$560 off the regular price currently on offer. With the iPhone 13 lineup about to drop into consumers' hands, expect iPhone 12 models to be included in Apple's refurbished listings soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Thanks, Anthony!)\nTags: Apple refurbished products, Canada\nThis article, \"Apple Begins Selling Refurbished iPhones in Canada\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

In a research note seen by MacRumors, Kuo shared some of his key hardware expectations for next year's tentatively named iPhone 14 Pro models, including a hole-punch display and a 48-megapixel Wide lens for the rear camera system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA hole-punch design refers to a display with only a small circular cutout for the front camera, as seen on many recent Samsung smartphones. This design would result in the notch being removed, with Face ID sensors likely moved under the display. Kuo said Apple is also working on iPhones with under-screen Touch ID for release in 2023.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for the rear camera, the 48-megapixel Wide lens would be an upgrade from the 12-megapixel Wide lens on iPhone 13 Pro models.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple is expected to release the iPhone 14 lineup in the second half of 2022, in line with usual launch timing. Kuo also reiterated that Apple plans to release a third-generation iPhone SE with 5G support in the first half of 2022. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn line with research shared by Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty this morning, Kuo said pre-orders for the iPhone 13 series have been higher than iPhone 12 series, particularly for the higher-end Pro models.\nRelated Roundup: iPhone 14\nTags: Ming-Chi Kuo, TF International Securities\nThis article, \"Kuo: iPhone 14 Pro Models to Feature Hole-Punch Display and 48MP Wide Camera\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "While it has been many years since Apple stopped providing first weekend sales numbers for new iPhones, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty today said that iPhone 13 Pro pre-orders are \"off to a promising start\" with \"strong early demand.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHuberty based her opinion off of Apple's delivery estimates for iPhones, which she has been tracking for many years. Shortly after pre-orders began last Friday, delivery estimates for the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max began slipping into October, with Huberty having calculated the average lead time at around 27 days. She said this is the second longest lead time on the first day of pre-orders amongst all iPhone models launched over the past five years, surpassed only by the iPhone X in 2017.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs of last Friday, Huberty said the iPhone 13 mini was faring better with a lead time of 3.1 days, while the standard iPhone 13 faced no delays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs with every iPhone launch, it is possible that lengthy delivery estimates are a function of low supply rather than high demand, but Huberty said Morgan Stanley's supply chain checks indicate minimal near-term component headwinds for iPhones and concluded that these long lead times \"are at least partly a function of strong early demand.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll four iPhone 13 models will begin arriving to customers and launch in stores on Friday, September 24. Key features across the iPhone 13 lineup include a faster A15 Bionic chip, camera improvements, longer battery life, and a smaller notch. The two Pro models also feature a ProMotion display with a variable refresh rate up to 120Hz.\nRelated Roundups: iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro\nTags: Katy Huberty, Morgan Stanley\nBuyer's Guide: iPhone 13 (Buy Now), iPhone 13 Pro (Buy Now)\nRelated Forum: iPhone\nThis article, \"iPhone 13 Pro Pre-Orders Off to Promising Start With Strong Early Demand, Says Analyst\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Starting next month, Apple is ramping up COVID-19 testing requirements for employees. According to The Verge's Zoe Schiffer, unvaccinated employees will be required to get frequent COVID-19 tests, while vaccinated employees will receive infrequent tests if going into an office or store.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnlike other tech companies, such as Google and Facebook, Apple has not mandated vaccines for its employees and still does not require workers to get vaccinated to remain at Apple. Prior to the upcoming testing mandate, testing was encouraged, but not required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple earlier this month began asking employees to provide details on their vaccination status, and it has been pushing vaccines through an internal vaccination campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple offers vouchers to get employees vaccinated through Walgreens along with on-site vaccinations in the San Francisco Bay Area and Austin. Paid time off is available for vaccine appointments, as is paid sick leave for those who experience side effects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMany corporate employees are still working from home at this point and will not be returning to the office until January at the earliest, but Apple also has a large retail workforce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe details on Apple's testing plans came from today's company-wide town hall meeting, where Cook also spoke on plans for a hybrid work model going forward. \"We learned as a company what it means for everyone to come in everyday because we did that before,\" he said. \"We know what it's like when hardly anyone comes in. We don't really know about the middle range. We need to learn.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCook said that Apple is committed to learning and tweaking its plans going forward, and he said that Apple plans to give everyone an extra three days off next quarter. In the U.S., employees will receive this time off on Thanksgiving week.\nTag: Apple Store\nThis article, \"Apple to Require COVID Testing for Employees Starting Next Month, Still No Vaccine Mandate\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Apple is planning to use an LTPS OLED display for at least one of the four models planned for the iPhone 14 series next year, according to Korean website The Elec, meaning that at least one iPhone 14 model would still have a 60Hz display. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe report lines up with information previously shared by display industry consultant Ross Young, who accurately claimed that the new iPad mini would feature an 8.3-inch display.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max unveiled this week feature ProMotion displays with a variable refresh rate between 10Hz and 120Hz, resulting in smoother appearing content when watching video, gaming, or scrolling text. The devices are able to offer this feature because they are equipped with lower-power LTPO OLED displays, whereas the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini have LTPS OLED displays without support for ProMotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lack of ProMotion on at least one iPhone 14 model wouldn't be too surprising, as Apple may keep the feature limited to the Pro models next year to maintain differentiation with the standard iPhone 14 models. Rumors suggest Apple plans to launch four iPhone 14 models next year, including a 6.1-inch iPhone 14, 6.7-inch iPhone 14 Max, 6.1-inch iPhone 14 Pro, and 6.7-inch iPhone 14 Pro Max, with no iPhone 14 mini.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe report adds that LG Display is aiming to start supplying Apple with LTPO OLED displays in 2022, which would give Apple another supplier of ProMotion displays for iPhones beyond Samsung, which is currently its exclusive supplier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the past, The Elec accurately reported that Apple would launch a new iPad Pro with a LiDAR Scanner in March 2020.\nRelated Roundup: iPhone 14\nTags: ProMotion, The Elec\nThis article, \"At Least One iPhone 14 Model Will Reportedly Still Lack 120Hz ProMotion Display\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Apple has made much of its iPhone 13 battery life improvements, noting for example that the 13 Pro Max offers the longest battery life ever in an iPhone. However, when you look at Apple's own battery comparisons versus the iPhone 12 lineup, it's the streaming video performance that the company has eked out of its new smartphones that really stands out. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\niPhone 12 mini: 10 hours\n\r\n\r\niPhone 12: 11 hours\n\r\n\r\niPhone 12 Pro: 11 hours\n\r\n\r\niPhone 12 Pro Max: 12 hours\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\niPhone 13 Mini: 13 hours\n\r\n\r\niPhone 13: 19 hours\n\r\n\r\niPhone 13 Pro: 20 hours\n\r\n\r\niPhone 13 Pro Max: 25 hours\n \n\nThe iPhone 13 lineup features new low-power displays, a more efficient A15 chip, larger batteries, and more power-efficient components, all of which make for dramatic improvements when streaming, as the numbers above show. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, Apple claims that when streaming video, the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max last nine hours and 13 hours longer than last year's equivalent models, respectively. Taking the same metric, the battery in the iPhone 13 mini manages 13 hours, which is longer than even the iPhone 12 Pro Max. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith video streaming services so ubiquitous these days, not to mention Apple TV+ (and obliquely, Fitness+), Apple has clearly factored the computations involved into the power optimizations that it has achieved through the tight integration of its hardware and software. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, battery life varies by use case and many other factors, so actual results will vary, but if they're anything near what Apple is claiming, binge-watching your favorite show should be a cinch on these latest devices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(H/T to Jack for pointing this out!)\nRelated Roundups: iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro\nBuyer's Guide: iPhone 13 (Buy Now), iPhone 13 Pro (Buy Now)\nRelated Forum: iPhone\nThis article, \"iPhone 13 Batteries Positively Excel at Video Streaming Compared to iPhone 12\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

In early Geekbench 5 results, the new iPad mini has average single-core and multi-core scores of around 1,595 and 4,540, compared to averages of around 1,730 and 4,660 for the iPhone 13 Pro.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMacRumors ran the benchmarks by Geekbench founder John Poole, who said the results appear to be legitimate, including the 2.9GHz clock speed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's unclear why Apple has downclocked the A15 chip in the iPad mini, but most users are unlikely to encounter any issues with performance using the device. Even with a downclocked A15 chip, the new iPad mini is up to 40% faster in single-core performance and up to 70% faster in multi-core performance compared to the previous-generation iPad mini with an A12 chip, according to benchmarks.

Pricing for the 64GB and 128GB ‌iPhone SE‌ options remains the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple is planning an update to the ‌iPhone SE‌ for the first half of 2022. The current model was launched in April 2020, so the removal of the 256GB variant could be a sign that Apple is beginning to ramp down production of this particular model.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring its virtual event, Apple announced that the iPhone 13 and ‌iPhone 13‌ mini start with 128GB of storage, which is double the base 64GB offered for the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe storage capacities available for the ‌iPhone 13‌ and ‌iPhone 13‌ mini include 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB, while the iPhone 13 Pro and ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ Max also have a new 1TB storage option. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPricing continues to start at $699 for the ‌iPhone 13‌ mini, $799 for the ‌iPhone 13‌, $999 for the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌, and $1,099 for the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ Max.

TIME shares an annual list highlighting world leaders, celebrities, tech company executives, authors, musicians, athletes, and more, and this is not the first time Cook has been celebrated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis year's list is broken up into categories that include Icons, Pioneers, Titans, Artists, Leaders, and Innovators. Cook is listed in the \"Titans\" category alongside Shonda Rhimes, Tom Brady, Timbaland and Swizz Beats, Simone Biles, and others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCook's profile was written by Nike co-founder Phil Knight, who reflected on his relationship with Cook and his talks with Cook as a Nike board member. According to Knight, Cook is a man of \"wisdom\" and \"excellent judgment.\"\nOne of his most difficult challenges was the change of leadership at Apple after Steve Jobs passed away, the Steve Jobs who was beloved and recognized around the world as a genius.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis almost impossible transition was handled with amazing dignity and grace, and announced to the world in his own quiet way: \"I am not the second Steve Jobs. I am the first Tim Cook.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd by the way, in the 10 years since... Apple stock has gone up 1,000%, making it the most valuable company in the world.\nOther notable names who made this year's list include Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, Naomi Osaka, Billie Eilish, \"Ted Lasso\" star Jason Sudeikis, Joe Biden, and Elon Musk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEarlier this year, Apple was listed as one of TIME's 100 Most Influential Companies of 2021 thanks to its record breaking holiday quarter and ever increasing product lineup.\nTag: Tim Cook\nThis article, \"Apple CEO Tim Cook Makes TIME's List of 100 Most Influential People of 2021\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

          "description": "Yesterday during Apple's virtual \"California streaming\" event, Apple debuted a refreshed ninth-generation entry-level iPad ($329) and a redesigned sixth-generation iPad mini ($499). Like the iPad Pro, both devices include a 12-megapixel Ultra Wide front camera enabling Center Stage, which makes the iPad Air ($579) the only tablet in Apple's lineup that lacks this feature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCenter Stage is a feature that automatically keeps users perfectly framed during video calls, and it does this by using the much larger field of view of the Ultra Wide front camera. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs users move around, Center Stage automatically pans to keep them in the shot. When other people join in on the call, the camera detects them too, and smoothly zooms out to fit everyone into the view and make sure they are part of the conversation. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple debuted the feature in April with the latest ‌iPad Pro‌. At the time, it was thought the machine learning capabilities of Apple's M1 chip were required to power the feature, but given that the new iPad and iPad mini use A13 and A15 Bionic chips, respectively, that's patently not the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe current ‌iPad Air‌, which debuted in September 2020, has an A14 Bionic processor, but only a f/2.0, 7-megapixel front-facing FaceTime HD Camera for selfies and video calls, making it incompatible with Center Stage. The ‌iPad Air‌ is in its mid-product cycle, however, so it's likely to get the 12-megapixel Ultra Wide front camera in a refresh, perhaps early next year.\nRelated Roundups: iPad mini, iPad, iPad Air \nTag: September 2021 Apple Event\nBuyer's Guide: iPad Mini (Buy Now), iPad (Buy Now), iPad Air (Neutral)\nRelated Forum: iPad\nThis article, \"iPad Air Now the Only iPad in Apple's Lineup That Lacks 12MP Ultra Wide Front Camera With Center Stage\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The ‌iPhone 13‌ models still support eSIM and nano-SIM, but also support two eSIMs for adopting carrier plans without a physical SIM card.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple's ‌iPhone 13‌ models will not ship with a physical SIM card this year and carriers will instead use eSIM capabilities for activation. Because eSIM activation is being used for devices connected to a carrier when ordering, a WiFi connection will be needed for setup. From Apple:\r\n\r\nCarrier-connected iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro models will arrive ready to activate with eSIM and can connect to your cellular voice and data service without a physical SIM card. You will need a Wi-Fi connection for setup.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo activate eSIM on an unconnected iPhone, please contact the carrier of your choice when you're ready.\n\r\n\r\nConnecting with a carrier later can be done by inserting a physical SIM or contacting a carrier for eSIM activation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ‌iPhone 13‌ models will be available for pre-order on Friday, September 17, and will officially launch on Friday, September 24.\nThis article, \"iPhone 13 Models Support Dual eSIMs\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The notch is indeed a good bit smaller, and the tiny increase in height is barely noticeable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new notch design is in line with rumors that we heard during the beta testing period, which pointed to a design that was more compact and just a tiny bit taller.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext year, Apple may do away with the notch entirely.

          "description": "At today's \"California Streaming\" event, Apple announced a new USB-C Apple Watch charging puck designed specifically with the Series 7 models in mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPriced at $29, the Apple Watch Magnetic Fast Charger to USB-C cable can charge an Apple Watch Series 7 33 percent faster than the standard Apple Watch charging puck, reaching an 80 percent charge in 45 minutes.\nWe wanted to make charging your Apple Watch utterly effortless. And now, it charges up to 33% faster when paired with Apple Watch Series 7, so you can reach 80% charge in about 45 minutes. Simply hold the connector near the back of the watch, where magnets cause it to snap into place automatically. It's a completely sealed system free of exposed contacts. And it's very forgiving, requiring no precise alignment.\nTo enable the faster charging speeds, the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ has an updated charging architecture inside. The fast charging technology is limited to the Series 7 for this reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new Apple Watch charging puck can be purchased from Apple's website starting today, but the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ models won't be launching until later this fall. When available, the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ will likely ship with the new fast charging cable as it has the same price point as the standard cable. \nRelated Roundup: Apple Watch Series 6\nTag: Apple Watch Series 7\nBuyer's Guide: Apple Watch (Don't Buy)\nRelated Forum: Apple Watch\nThis article, \"Apple Now Selling USB-C Magnetic Charger for Fast Charging Apple Watch Series 7 Models\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Apple will also be surveying the Region of Durham immediately east of Toronto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple says it is committed to protecting the public's privacy while conducting these surveys. In line with Google's Street View, Apple censors faces and license plates in imagery made available through its Look Around feature. If you have comments or questions about this process, your privacy rights, or would like to request that a face, license plate, or your own house be censored, Apple says to email mapsimagecollection@apple.com.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduced in iOS 13, Look Around provides 3D street-level imagery that can be zoomed and panned.

The yellow, orange, and purple colors cannot be purchased in stores and must be ordered online.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe change will make it easier for customers who want one of the more unusual ‌iMac‌ colors to get an ‌iMac‌ right away without having to wait for shipping. It may also mean that third-party stores will be able to carry additional colors, as retailers like Best Buy have also been limited to green, pink, blue, and silver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are highly anticipated redesigned 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro models that are in the works, but unfortunately, we are not expecting these new machines at the September event.

This sale is just a couple of cents off from the lowest price we've ever seen on this accessory, and it's one of the best prices available online this week. It's also being matched at Walmart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe MagSafe Charger perfectly aligns with the magnets on the iPhone 12 family of devices and provides wireless charging. It also maintains compatibility with Qi charging, so any iPhone 8 or later device can still use it, as well as AirPods with a Wireless Charging Case and AirPods Pro.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n$9 OFF\nMagSafe Charger for $29.98\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor optimal charging, Apple recommends using a 20W USB-C Power Adapter with the MagSafe Charger, but it's sold separately. However, Costco members this week can save on both of these accessories when bundled together, priced at $39.99. Individually, the 20W USB-C Power Adapter costs $19.00 and the MagSafe Charger costs $39.00, so you're essentially getting the Power Adapter at no extra cost with this deal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, you'll need to be a Costco member to see the deal and be able to purchase it. You'll have until September 10 before the sale ends, and there is a limit of two per member.

And with that, Apple will be sending tens of millions of dollars (maybe more?) indirectly to weather.com — which, incidentially is now owned by IBM. Insert the Steve Jobs giving the finger image here.\nDo weather.com executives hold some sort of blackmail on the iPad OS dev team within Apple? I can’t come up with a better explanation.\nThe whole situation is bizarre. Apple just redid the Weather app in iOS 15 to be more beautiful. And the widgets reflect that. And they throw it all in the trash compactor when it comes time to drill down on the iPad.\nThe lack of a built-in iPad Weather app was a little weird before, but now that they have a built-in Weather widget that, when you tap it, takes you to The Weather Channel’s janky-assed website, it’s downright bizarre.\n ★",

          "description": "John Jurgensen, writing for The Wall Street Journal (News+):\nNow he’s attempting to re-engage with a show that offers fewer\njokes and a more earnest agenda. With his new biweekly series,\n“The Problem With Jon Stewart,” his first challenge is getting\npeople to notice it at all. Apple TV+ is decidedly more plush but\nless entrenched than basic cable.\nFans will find aspects of “The Problem With Jon Stewart” familiar.\nIn front of an audience, he sits at a table for an opening\nmonologue (now wearing a T-shirt and bomber jacket instead of a\nsuit and tie). He twirls his pen, pauses for deadpan stares into\nthe camera, stifles giggles behind his fist and makes\nself-deprecating cracks like, “I am what’s left of Jon Stewart.”\nBreaking from his previous format, the show includes unscripted\nsegments in the show’s writers’ room, where Mr. Stewart and his\nstaff banter over each episode’s topic (expanded on in a weekly\ncompanion podcast). A separate panel discussion captures the\nshow’s sober tone.\nI watched the first episode and was bored to tears. I certainly sympathize with the plight of U.S. veterans who’ve been gravely harmed by the burning of toxic waste, but the show itself felt like a droll hour-long lecture — not a good sign when the show was in fact only 40 minutes long. Strong “When is this going to be over?” vibes. It was like being stuck back in school.\nI’m not saying Stewart can or should only do comedy. I like serious issue-based shows, too, but the good ones, like 60 Minutes, move along at a fast clip. John Oliver’s Last Week Tonight devotes itself to the most serious issues in the world today, but the show is entertaining, fast-paced, and funny as hell. It moves. The premiere of The Problem With Jon Stewart can only be described as “plodding”. I’ll give it another shot this week, but one more like last week’s and I’m out.\n ★",

The company’s stock\nprice has risen nearly 30 percent in the past year, lifted by\nstrong advertising revenue and a spike in use of some products\nduring the pandemic. Facebook is still growing in countries\noutside the United States, and could succeed there even if it\nstumbles domestically. And the company has invested heavily in\nnewer initiatives, like augmented and virtual reality products,\nthat could turn the tide if they’re successful.\nBut Facebook’s research tells a clear story, and it’s not a happy\none. Its younger users are flocking to Snapchat and TikTok, and\nits older users are posting anti-vaccine memes and arguing about\npolitics. Some Facebook products are actively shrinking, while\nothers are merely making their users angry or self-conscious.\nFacebook’s declining relevance with young people shouldn’t\nnecessarily make its critics optimistic. History teaches us that\nsocial networks rarely age gracefully, and that tech companies can\ndo a lot of damage on the way down.\n ★",

We don’t\nget anything. And we don’t like this. We know our constituents\ndon’t like this. But if we don’t do these stories, we don’t get\ndistributed. And so it used to be that we did very little of it,\nand now we have to do a lot of it, because we have jobs to do. And\nif we don’t get traffic and engagement, we’ll lose our jobs.”\nHaugen’s whistleblowing jibes exactly with my theory all along: Facebook prioritizes growth and engagement over all else, and when they discovered that polarizing angering content drives engagement more than anything else, they let it fly. It’s that simple.\n ★",

          "description": "Jason Snell, Six Colors:\nThe problem is that most people don’t buy a new iPhone every year.\nThe primary upgraders to the iPhone 13 will be coming from the\niPhone 7, or 8, or X, or XS, or XR. For them, several years of\nApple innovations will be rolled into a single purchase. But\nreviews of the new iPhones will not address what happened in 2018,\nor 2019, or 2020.\nHere’s an attempt to provide a little more of a big-picture\noverview for owners of older iPhones who are wondering what’s new\nin the iPhone 13. I’ve simplified matter a little — if you own a\n“plus” or “max” model of iPhone, obviously your phone will be a\nlittle larger, and you may want to consider the direct upgrade to\nthe iPhone 13 Pro Max to continue with your large phone. The\niPhone 13 mini is also a great option for those who prefer a\nsmaller phone with all the same power as the larger iPhone 13.\nThis is a fantastic idea. You just scroll down to whatever iPhone you’re currently using, and boom, there’s a list of the top upgrades you’d experience if you upgrade to an iPhone 13. Apple’s excellent iPhone Compare page has all this information, but the Compare page also tells you everything that’s the same or roughly equivalent between models. Snell’s guide focuses on the big changes from iPhone Old and iPhone New.\n ★",

The\nsecurity researcher, whose name is Denis Tokarev, said he decided\nto publish the bugs’ details as well as the source code that makes\nit extremely easy to reproduce and exploit them, because he was\ntired of waiting and felt like Apple ignored him.\nTokarev reported the vulnerabilities to Apple between March 10 and\nApril 29, but the last time he heard back from Apple about the\nthree vulnerabilities was August 6, August 12, and August 25,\nrespectively. Then the researcher said he told Apple on September\n13 he would publish details of the bugs unless he heard back.\nIt was only after he went public with details about the unpatched\nbugs that Apple reached out, according to Tokarev, who shared\nApple’s email with Motherboard.\n“We saw your blog post regarding this issue and your other\nreports. We apologize for the delay in responding to you,” an\nApple employee wrote. “We want to let you know that we are still\ninvestigating these issues and how we can address them to protect\ncustomers.

          "description": "Last April, after posting this photo of my desk setup for my iPad Air review, I got a few questions about the stand I was using to prop up the iPad. The answer was Anker’s $15 Multi-Angle Stand. Last week I posted a similar photo, this time for my iPad Mini review, and I’m still using the same stand. Alas, that stand is no longer available.\nThe closest thing I could find is this $10 copy of that stand from Amazon Basics. It’s such a blatant rip-off of Anker’s stand that ordinarily I wouldn’t link to it, on principle, but, given that Anker’s original is seemingly no longer being produced, a rip-off design is the best we can do. I even bought one to try it out before linking to it. (If you buy one through this link, I’ll earn affiliate revenue that will get me one step closer to buying one of the upcoming Jony Ive/Marc Newson-designed electric Ferraris.)\nAmazon’s multi-angle stand is extremely similar to Anker’s in size, weight, and angles of tilt. But it’s slightly lacking in fit and finish compared to Anker’s. Whereas Anker’s felt like a bargain at $15, this one feels like what you’d expect from a $10 knock-off. My biggest annoyance is that Amazon, for some reason, decided to screen print “Press/Presse” on the button that you quite obviously must press to adjust the tilt. (Why French?) This is as helpful as printing “Press” on the knock of a click pen. And of course they typeset these needless words in Arial. A wee nip of nail polish remover took care of that, though.\nI still recommend it. It folds flat, and when your iPad is sitting in it, the stand effectively disappears.\n ★",

          "description": "A bunch of you are probably getting new iPhones (and iPads) today. As someone who’s set up 5 new devices in the last week, my advice is to restore a new iPhone with the Quick Start device-to-device transfer, not iCloud backup. Don’t worry if it says it might take a little longer this way, it’s worth it. Get a cup of coffee or a bite to eat. A watched pot never boils; a watched transfer never finishes.\nDevice-to-device is better because it moves over all your login credentials. When you restore from an iCloud backup, you wind up logged out of a lot of apps on the new device. When you restore device-to-device, almost everything moves over. I know there are exceptions, but I don’t think I bounced into a single app that didn’t keep me fully logged in this week. If you tried device-to-device a few years ago and found it lacking, try it again now — Apple has improved this process every year since it debuted. Worst case scenario, you can always start over and use iCloud backup.\nAlso, you do not need to unpair your Apple Watch from your old iPhone using this method. You can just wear your watch the whole time. When the transfer is complete, the new iPhone will prompt you, asking if you want to move your watch to the new iPhone. Your mileage may vary but it just worked for me.\nI posted this on Twitter tonight, and realized I should post about this here too. The Twitter thread has a bunch of Q&A’s about specific apps, like authentication tokens in Authy (they transfer fine).\n ★",

In-person communication simply cannot be beaten for conveying subtlety.\nProduct reviews are hampered too. With in-person Apple events, most reviewers get kit in the hours after the keynote ends. With virtual Apple events, the kit ships for delivery the next day. An extra day makes a big difference when the review embargo drops just one week after the event.\n ★",

          "description": "Nice supercut video from The Verge squeezing Microsoft’s Surface event yesterday into eight minutes. A few thoughts:\nIt seems like Microsoft is letting the Surface division stand on its own, brand-wise. They’re not distancing themselves from Microsoft in any way, but branding-wise they’re just letting the products be the “Surface Whatever”, not the “Microsoft Surface Whatever”. There’s even a moment in the event, regarding the folding Duo 2 phone, when a guy says it has “the most precise and reliable hinge mechanism ever engineered at Surface”. I.e. that it was “Surface” who engineered that hinge, not “Microsoft”. I think Surface works as a Microsoft sub-brand like that.\nSpeaking of the Surface Duo 2 — their folding phone with two screens — they’re now just calling it what they should have called it all along: a phone. It’s a very interesting and unique form factor, but it’s a big folding phone, not a small folding tablet. It supposedly has real cameras this time, too. Starting price: $1,500.\nThe new Surface Laptop Studio looks really dumb to me. I don’t understand why one would ever want to use it in either of the new folding positions. I guess maybe if you really want to draw on it, you might want to fold it flat, but if you really want to draw that much, why not buy the Surface Pro 8 that detaches from the keyboard? This design just seems dumb.\nThe Surface Slim Pen 2 introduces haptic feedback, to simulate the feel of a pen on paper. I love stuff like that.\n ★",

          "description": "Joe Rossignol, reporting for MacRumors:\nApple Watch Series 7 models are equipped with a new module that\nenables 60.5GHz wireless data transfer, according to FCC\nfilings viewed by MacRumors, but this functionality may be\nreserved for Apple’s internal use only for now.\nThe filings indicate that the 60.5GHz module is only activated\nwhen the Apple Watch is placed on a proprietary magnetic dock with\na corresponding 60.5GHz module, but this dock will likely be\nreserved for use by Apple employees. For example, it’s possible\nthat Apple Stores might use the dock to wirelessly restore an\nApple Watch, and if so, it will be interesting to see if Series 7\nmodels still have a hidden diagnostic port for wired connectivity.\nThis is a little interesting in and of itself. But if you look at the long-term trend, it’s a sign that Apple — along with the rest of the industry — is moving toward wireless technology for both charging and data transfer. Apple Watch exemplifies that — it’s never had a port, either for charging or data. There’s a diagnostic port hidden inside the bottom channel for the watch strap, but those diagnostics are neither charging nor data.\nIt’s long been my guess that iPhone is never going to support USB-C. I think it’s Apple’s intention to go straight from Lightning to wireless/inductive, with no “port”. Portless is the future for all devices. Yet the product design geniuses at the European Commission want to mandate all devices have one specific port in 2024 and indefinitely thereafter — a port that by that time will already be 10 years old.\n ★",

          "description": "Judd Legum, writing at Popular Information:\nOn Friday, CEO Tim Cook answered a question about Apple’s stance\non the Texas ban at an all-staff meeting. Cook said that “the\ncompany was looking into whether it could aid the legal fight\nagainst the new law.”\nApple has considerable leverage over the abortion debate in Texas\nand across the country — but it is not related to its ability to\npay for lawyers. Apple’s leverage rests in its status as a major\nemployer and driver of economic growth.\nIf Apple believes that its employees should be able to “make their\nown decisions regarding their reproductive health,” it could\npublicly state that it will not expand its workforce in states\nthat limit abortion rights. That would have a major influence not\nonly in Texas but in numerous states considering following Texas’\nlead.\nLast week, TechCrunch published the text of a company-wide memo posted to an internal Apple message board regarding Texas’s near-outlawing of abortion. It began:\nA message about women’s reproductive health care\nAt Apple, we support our employees’ rights to make their own\ndecisions regarding their reproductive health.\nLegum is right — it’s untenable for Apple, or any other company, to “support our employees’ rights to make their own decisions regarding their reproductive health” and ask any woman to work for the company in a state with a law like Texas’s. An immediate hiring and construction freeze in Texas — explicitly tied to this outrageous law (which makes no exceptions for rape or incest) — is the only tenable action compatible with Apple’s stated values.\nDavid Simon, linking to Legum’s post:\nIf an employer, this is beyond politics. I’m turning in scripts\nnext month on an HBO non-fiction miniseries based on events in\nTexas, but I can’t and won’t ask female cast/crew to forgo civil\nliberties to film there. What else looks like Dallas/Ft. Worth?\nThat’s the answer. You move your business out of Texas. Any company that expands or initiates new operations in Texas implicitly supports Texas’s abortion ban.\n ★",

I thought it would be\ninteresting to look at some basic iPhone benchmarks through the\nyears and look at how much performance improvement happens every\nfour years.\nIncremental improvements every year turn into profound improvements over 3–4 years. It’s like the technology version of compound interest. It adds up.\nAs I benchmarked the A15 Bionic in different ways and pondered how\nApple spends its transistor budget with each A-series chip cycle,\nan interesting shift emerged for iPhone 13. Going back to how\nApple spends their transistor budget on features, not necessarily\nperformance, for the A15, Apple looks to have had the most GPU\ngains YoY since the A9. For the past five years, Apple has had an\naverage of 19% GPU gains YoY but for the A15 Bionic, Apple has\nincreased GPU performance by 52%.\nThis intentional increase in GPU performance over CPU performance\nspeaks to the more graphically intense features Apple had in mind\nfor iPhone 13 that is demonstrated in things like macro\nphotography, macro video, and Cinematic Mode. Developers also now\nhave a dramatically increased GPU at their disposal to create new\napp experiences around and can leverage new augmented reality\ntechniques, visual computing and AI, and more.\nIt’s almost enough to make one think that Apple is ready to release high-end professional Macs built around Apple GPUs.\n ★",

They’d look at the jittering and think something is\nbroken with their iPhone camera. The framing should never change\nfrom what you compose and never automatically.\nWong’s screen recording illustrates the issue perfectly.\nWhen I first pressed Apple and made them aware of the jarring\ncamera switching, I was told it’s how the camera system works. On\nthe eve of this review, Apple changed course and said it’s going\nto release a software update to let users disable the camera\nswitching. According to Apple:\nA new setting will be added in a software update this fall to turn\noff automatic camera switching when shooting at close distances\nfor macro photography and video.\n ★",

It really\ndoes provide a filmic, dreamy quality to the video that I was\npreviously only able to get with quick and continuous focus\nadjustments on an SLR shooting video with a manually focused lens.\nThat, I think, is the major key to understanding Cinematic Mode.\nDespite the marketing, this mode is intended to unlock new\ncreative possibilities for the vast majority of iPhone users who\nhave no idea how to set focal distances, bend their knees to\nstabilize and crouch-walk-rack-focus their way to these kinds of\ntracking shots. It really does open up a big bucket that was just\ninaccessible before. And in many cases I think that those willing\nto experiment and deal with its near-term foibles will be\nrewarded with some great looking shots to add to their iPhone\nmemories widget.\nThat sounds right to me.\n ★",

          "description": "Dieter Bohn, writing for The Verge:\nApple’s marketing for the camera system on the 13 Pro is that it’s\nthe “biggest advancement ever.” I don’t know that I would go that\nfar, but I also can’t remember the last time I’ve said “whoa, look\nat this photo” as many times as I have during this review. […]\nWhere the Pro 13 camera system shines is in low light. The main\nwide-angle sensor has seen a massive upgrade this year. Unlike\nAndroid phones that are chasing big megapixel counts and then\n“pixel binning” to achieve low light performance, Apple is\nsticking with 12 megapixels, the same resolution it’s used since\n2015’s iPhone 6S. The sensor itself is much bigger now and\nfeatures 1.9 µm pixels, which are about as big as anything we’ve\nseen on a smartphone. And on top of all that, the lens now has an\nƒ/1.5 aperture.\nAll of that adds up to a camera that can very quickly take in a\nmassive amount of light relative to other phones. Combined with\nsome tuning and improvements to Apple’s computational photography,\nthe low light performance on the 13 Pro is simply second to none.\nI came away super impressed with the low light performance of the 13 Pro, too.\nBohn makes an important point in his corresponding review of the 13 and 13 Mini too: because the camera bumps are all new sizes, cases for the iPhone 13 won’t fit the 13 Pro, nor vice-versa.\n ★",

In the meantime, current Primephonic subscribers\nwill receive six months of Apple Music for free, providing access\nto hundreds of thousands of classical albums, all in Lossless and\nhigh-resolution audio, as well as hundreds of classical albums in\nApple Music’s Spatial Audio, with new albums added regularly.\nI’ve had this flagged for a few weeks. What I find interesting is Apple is going to use this acquisition to launch a dedicated classical music app, not to expand the Music app. iTunes, infamously, expanded greatly over the years, and everyone seems to agree that the user experience suffered for it.

The new model doesn’t sport the big\ndesign refresh multiple sources said was coming. It doesn’t even\npack a new chip.\nIs this the upgrade Apple wanted to deliver this year? Or is it\na last-minute substitution that Cupertino had to settle on\nbecause the refresh it really wanted to deliver just wasn’t\nready to roll out?\nBased on the evidence, we’re going to say it’s the latter.\nThe only way this could be funnier is if Bell included the theory that perhaps Apple changed the hardware at the last minute because the flat-edge designs leaked.\nThis is not how hardware works. These designs are set long in advance. In fact, from what I’ve heard, the flat-edge watch designs might be legitimate leaks, but they’re next year’s designs. That’s how far in advance Apple works on hardware — they were already in the advanced stages of designing the 2022 Apple Watches months ago. (Aesthetically, I am not sold on a flat-edge design for the watch. The round edges are iconic and organic.)\nYou can argue that Series 7 is a marginal upgrade over Series 6, but with an all-new screen (brighter and bigger), all-new crystal (more durable), and 33 percent faster charging, there are upgrades, and none of them could be slapped together.\n ★",

          "description": "From the city’s website:\nPhiladelphians use almost 1 billion plastic bags each year, which\nlitter our streets, waterways, and commercial corridors. Plastic\nbags account for over 10,000 hours of lost staff time and pose a\ndanger to workers at recycling facilities because they get caught\nin the equipment. Banning plastic bags will make our city cleaner,\nreduce waste and save money.\nI’ve been reading Millions, Billions, Zillions by Brian Kernighan (who is apparently a computer scientist of some renown). It’s a great book ($11 in hardcover from Amazon; BookShop.org link to indie booksellers), and Kernighan’s writing style is as buttery smooth as ever. One of the things he does is encourage back-of-the-envelope math on numbers like the above, when you encounter them. Does it make sense that Philadelphians use 1 billion plastic bags per year?\nPhilly has about 1.6 million residents. 1 billion divided by 1.6 million is 625 plastic bags per person per year, about 12 bags per person per week, or 1.7 bags per person per day. When I consider how often stores double-bag anything vaguely heavy, that seems plausible. (There’s also the fact that Philly gets many tourists, and in normal times there are many non-residents who commute into the city daily for work. Feel free to bump 1.6 million to a higher number, but for ballpark “does this figure make sense” purposes, I think the Census figure is fine.)\n10,000 annual hours of lost staff time is high, but seems plausible too: That’s about 192 hours per week, or about 5 full-time employees.\n ★",

If you or anyone you know is getting a new iPhone soon, I would strongly recommend one of Anker’s chargers over Apple’s — same speed, same price, much smaller, and a few color options to top it off.\nAnother Anker charger I’ve been meaning to recommend is the Atom PowerPort III Slim. It’s a 30-watt charger currently on sale for $19, and what makes it different is that it’s, well, very slim (including folding prongs).

While Platinum is intentionally going for “oil painting style” graphics with Babylon’s Fall, some found the aesthetic to be too muddy and stylized. So Platinum’s changing that.\nOn Wednesday, PlatinumGames and Square Enix showed off the revised graphics for Babylon’s Fall, which, while certainly clearer, still maintain the studio’s “brushwork style” that’s based on classical European oil paintings. You can see the revised graphical style in the slider image below, with the new graphics shown on the right.\n\n\nOn Babylon’s Fall’s official website, the developers revealed the new graphics in an update from the game’s closed beta test. Regarding the graphics, the developers said, “This was an area we received many strong opinions and requests about in Phases 1 and 2 of the Closed Beta Test, particularly regarding poor visibility. Accordingly, we have been working to improve the overall visual clarity, while still keeping the distinctive classic fantasy oil painting aesthetic.”\nSo, yeah, things are far less blurry in the latest version of Babylon’s Fall — which does not have a release date.\nSquare Enix and PlatinumGames announced Babylon’s Fall way back in 2018. After a period of concerning quiet, the game reemerged this summer, with Platinum confirming that the project would be a live-service multiplayer game. Babylon’s Fall is bound for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC.",

Hidden object games focus singularly on this one idea — the gameplay of searching — to create compelling environments, to tell stories, and to build out worlds.\nYou could argue that there are elements of hidden object games in most video games.

It looks like a new kind of ghoul is coming to the game, according to a post on Kinetic Games’ social media.\nThe teaser image shows two new ghost types, although their names and the specifics are blurred out.

In addition, there is an upcoming Nightmare Difficulty option for particularly hardy hunters, some features that are simply marked as REDACTED, and more.\nMore details about Phasmophobia’s next update will be released closer to Halloween, but it looks like it’ll be a great time to pick the flashlight back up and explore what the early access title has to offer. Since launch, Kinetic Games has continued to add features to the game that help make it a mainstay on Twitch, with features like new ghosts and levels, or the ability to scare your friends by throwing things at them as a ghost after you’ve died.",

Other developers will get access to the tools soon, which means that even more games should be getting their official Epic Achievements before the end of the year. \nThe details page of each game with Epic Achievements will display all achievements, as well as progress toward unlocking them. The achievements will also give XP that will level up Epic accounts, letting players show off their feats to their friends.

Thankfully, all of the developer achievements, which were exclusive to specific games before, will still be available in any game they were a part of. \nIn fact, according to Epic, if a game previously had developer achievements and switches over to the new Epic Achievements, all progress will carry over right away, and you’ll get the XP you already earned.",

No, it’s just ditching its logo (Orange 021 C and good ol’ Process Yellow making a rich Pantone 185 C) in favor of an anodyne word-balloon wordmark.\nIn a statement, the company said the outgoing logo “expresses the fusion of Bandai and Namco that was created when the two companies integrated,” although not necessarily in that order, back in 2006. “It will be replaced with a new logo that reflects our new Purpose.”\nSooooo … what is that new purpose?

To describe Ito’s new game as minimalist might be underselling it; players appear to walk through grid-based labyrinths, are rewarded for mapping them out, and occasionally fall into menu-based battles against monsters. Dungeon Encounters’ first trailer is perplexing and perhaps a bit distressing for fans of Ito’s past work — but I remain hopeful.\nIn addition to Ito, Final Fantasy 12: The Zodiac Age producer Hiroaki Kato — who also worked on Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together and two Final Fantasy Tactics games for Square Enix — is also working on the game. Musical director Nobuo Uematsu is “overseeing” the soundtrack, and Dungeon Encounters features character art from designer Ryoma Ito, whose talents are on display here.\nImage: Square Enix\n  \nWhile it appears we’ll see many of the game’s characters in 2D static artwork form, there is a big fat cat named Sir Cat and a dachshund with a sword in its mouth named Jufren, and I already want to spend time with them.\nBeyond that, Square Enix promises “100 levels of thought-provoking challenges,” so I’m approaching Dungeon Encounters from the angle of “this looks like a good puzzle game, not something with an actual budget” and hoping for the best.\nDungeon Encounters will be available digitally for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Windows PC via Steam on Oct. 14. The game will cost $29.99, but is currently discounted to $23.99 for pre-orders.",

The upcoming Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters takes a different, more tactical approach to things. In Chaos Gate, players take the role of the Space Marine chapter known as the Grey Knights, and take the fight to Chaos in an X-Com style game.\nThe Grey Knights are a mysterious Space Marine chapter; while games like Space Marine focus on the Ultramarines, who take the front lines, the Grey Knights are more about the mystical and faith-based sides of the Imperium. In battling back Chaos Space Marines and a mysterious disease known as the Bloom, the Grey Knights will need to update their base of operations, build new facilities, run research projects, and head into combat missions. \nOnce Grey Knights are in the field, players will need to upgrade them into classes. There are four classes, and players can customize their armor and facial options to create their own special squad. Chaos Space Marines evolve as well, which escalates combat and forces players to focus on strategy.\nThe narrative is written by Black Library author Aaron Dembski-Bowden, so this should have some interesting lore for Warhammer fans.\nWarhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters is currently planned to release on PC in 2022.",

This has led to long queues as players try to log into the game.\nDuring its official launch day of Sept. 28, New World peaked at number two on Steam with a player count of just over 700,000. This massive player count is good news for Amazon, but the game’s servers apparently weren’t up to the task. The game has over 26,000 Steam reviews, and most of them — which Steam labels as Mixed, with just 48% skewing positive at the time of writing — complain about the game’s massive queues and limited server capacity. \nOf course, Amazon Game Studios is more than aware of New World’s problem. In a launch day update post on the game’s website, the developer explained that its short-term goal is setting up new servers and working to expand the capacity of the ones that are already online, in order to help everyone log in and play as soon as possible. \nAmazon Game Studios also has a long-term plan to let players transfer their characters to an entirely new server for free in the next two weeks. This should help balance the load so that certain overpopulated servers aren’t too stressed, while lower-population servers — with lower queue times — should get a boost in players to even things out.\nWhile all of these plans should help reduce the queue times in the future for New World, it’s likely that players will still have to deal with a wait to log in for the next few days, especially on more populated servers. But as Amazon rolls out its solutions, and the hype eventually dies down a bit, players should hopefully be able to get into Aeternum a little more quickly.",

The beta will run from Oct. 6-9, Electronic Arts and developer DICE announced on Tuesday. \nThe open beta will include Battlefield’s signature Conquest mode, but with a slight twist: Two teams will compete to control several flags in certain areas, rather than larger individual control points. The beta will feature the game’s Orbital map, which takes the fight to an active rocket launch site. During the beta, players can choose to play as one of four different specialists, who each more or less represent a traditional Battlefield class and have their own abilities. \nBattlefield 2042 players who have pre-ordered the game will get access to the beta starting on Oct. 6 for an exclusive two-day early access period. The beta will open up for all players starting on Oct. 8. The beta will be available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. PlayStation Plus is not required to participate in the open beta, but if you plan to play on Xbox, you will need an active Xbox Live Gold subscription.\nDICE and EA also announced the PC system requirements for the beta, which you can find below: \nMinimum PC requirements\nOS: 64-bit Windows 10\nProcessor (AMD): AMD Ryzen 5 3600\nProcessor (Intel): Core i5-6600K\nMemory: 8 GB\nVideo Memory: 4 GB\nGraphics card (NVIDIA): Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti\nGraphics card (AMD): AMD Radeon RX 560\nDirectX: 12\nOnline Connection Requirements: 512 kbps or faster Internet connection\nHard-drive space: 100 GB\nRecommended PC requirements\nOS: 64-bit Windows 10\nProcessor (AMD): AMD Ryzen 7 2700X\nProcessor (Intel): Intel Core i7-4790\nMemory: 16 GB\nVideo Memory: 8 GB\nGraphics card (NVIDIA): Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060\nGraphics card (AMD): AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT\nDirectX: 12\nOnline Connection Requirements: 512 kbps or faster Internet connection\nHard-drive space: 100 GB SSD",

The worst of these is a camera stutter that happens just about every time players move their mouse. It’s an extremely frustrating issue, but one that Arkane hopes to have fixed with a new patch released on Tuesday. \nAccording to the patch notes that Arkane released with the new update, Tuesday’s hotfix aims to address issues that PC players have had where “mouse-based camera movements could result in the appearance of ‘stutter.’” That’s a lot of qualifiers to parse, but it seems like Arkane is saying that these aren’t actually frame rate stutters, they just have the “appearance” of them. Whatever the problem was, hopefully this patch makes it feel a little better.\nWhile the camera problem might be solved, it isn’t the only problem with Deathloop’s PC port. Arkane also explains in the patch notes that it’s looking into other problems as well. For instance, when you play Deathloop at an extremely high frame rate, the game also encounters a stutter. In our experience the game became nearly unplayable at 240 fps thanks to this issue, but it was fine when locked at 140 fps. In Tuesday’s patch notes, Arkane said that it thinks it’s identified the problem and will update players when it has more information. \nEven if there are still a few problems, the good news is Arkane seems to be working on them and trying to make the PC port as smooth as possible for players.",

But nothing seems able to stop the overwhelming stupidity of its friendly AI.\nKestrel Lancers kicks off with a series of wargames which, fitting nicely with the overall lore of the BattleTech universe, are actually live-fire field exercises.

Siren Shrines and Treasuries are arriving to the Sea of Thieves, and players will be able to either track them on their boat’s map, or look for the telltale shimmer of siren treasure on the surface of the water. The reward, of course, is tons of treasure.\nSome underwater enemies were introduced during the previous season, A Pirate’s Life, which included a crossover with Disney’s Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. They play a much bigger role in season 4. Siren shrines seem to have a lot in common with the above-water fort, except instead of skeletons, players have to work their way through waves of sirens, coral beasts, and other threats. They also have to solve puzzles to get to the final wave of treasure. \nLuckily, helpful mermaids will help pirates transport their loot to the surface in one go, so you don’t have to worry about the long trip back and forth with all of your coral-encrusted treasure. Coral-encrusted bottles have washed up on the shores, which give the player voyages into the Sunken Kingdom in order to find the Breath of the Sea. This mysterious potion sells and gives rep to the training companies.\nPirates can earn special coral-related cosmetics, like a ship set, scars, and even a curse by completing the new Sunken Kingdom. There’s also a Plunder Pass, which is free and offers 100 free levels of gear and currencies. An updated Plunder Pass grants some extra cosmetics for interested players.\nSea of Thieves’ new season is planned to launch on Sept. 23, and is a free addition to the game. The Sunken Kingdom content will remain in the game for players to explore, while the Plunder Pass is limited to the three-month duration of this season.",

The sequel, originally known as Outcast 2: The Lost Paradise, was announced the following year, but it was never completed due to financial issues.\nBut Outcast 2 looks like it’s actually going to happen this time, thanks to THQ Nordic, which is publishing the long-awaited sequel, once again developed by Appeal Studios. (The Belgian developer also released a modern remake of Outcast in 2017, titled Outcast - Second Contact, which Nacon published.) THQ Nordic says that its has reunited members of the original Outcast team, including composer Lennie Moore, to create Outcast 2.\n\n\nCutter Slade, the Navy SEAL protagonist of the original game, will return in Outcast 2 - A New Beginning. Cutter’s been resurrected “by the almighty Yods,” the game’s Steam page says, and will need to save the planet Adelpha from invading robot forces. Cutter’s jetpack will let him “jump, air-dash, glide, and quickly traverse” Outcast 2’s open world.\nTHQ Nordic and Appeal Studios describe Outcast 2 - A New Beginning as an open-world action-adventure game with non-linear story — players’ actions and decisions will change the narrative’s outcome. \nOutcast 2 is in development for PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X.

There are also crystal walls and shelves to showcase all of your treasure, which is a nice touch. Then there are more cooking supplies, a cartography table, an Obliterator to destroy unwanted items, and a new iron cooking station for gourmet recipes. \nThere are also general improvements to the game, like a weapon rebalance that makes each individual weapon feel a little more distinct. There are also 12 new food items and a host of new weapons. \nHearth & Home is a free update and plays best on a fresh Valheim world.

The studio will be working on feedback in four areas — song library; audio inputs and note detection; progression and education; UI, search, and content discoverability.\nWith regard to the song library, “we’re committed to offering over 5,000 songs” at launch, Von Nagel wrote. The closed beta purposefully had a selection of about 500 songs. He went into greater detail about the other three development areas in a message to the community.\n“We understand that this delay is disappointing,” Von Nagel wrote. “Every Rocksmith Plus player deserves to easily find the music you care about, to feel a sense of growth and mastery over your instrument, and to trust that the notes you play are heard fairly and accurately.”\nRocksmith Plus was announced in June during E3 2021.

          "description": "Image: CD Projekt Red\n    \n\n  \nMoist, even\n There have been a lot of questions about Cyberpunk 2077 since it launched in December, but none more strange that the one asked by the Polygon video team: Is Cyberpunk 2077 wet enough? We can now safely say that no, in fact, the game clearly launched without the requisite amount of moisture. The latest patch, numbered 1.31, should fix that.\nAs far as Cyberpunk patches go, this is a pretty small one. There were a few quest bugs that got squashed, but nothing game-breaking it sounds like. The PlayStation got a little “GPU optimization,” so we’ll have to see how that shakes out performance wise. But this update didn’t even come with a mock newscast to herald its arrival. From the description, it sounds like you might not even notice it. “Please note that the issues listed below did not affect all players” CD Projekt said in its preamble. \nBut then there’s this note:\nFixed an issue where roads after rain did not look wet, which was the result of ongoing work on the Wet Surfaces System. In 1.31 wet surfaces should look more detailed than they did even before the issue occurred.\n\n\n\nAs Polygon’s official wet correspondent pointed out in February, Night City should be damp,  its surfaces sodden, and even its smoothest features covered in rivulets of water because that’s how it was described by Mike Pondsmith and the team at R. Talsorian Games when the original tabletop game launched in the 1980s.\n“It always rains,” reads the official worldbook. “Every day should be grim, gloomy and overcast. The stars never come out. The sun never shines. There are no singing birds, laughing children. The last bird died in 2008 and the kids are grown in vats. The ozone layer is decayed, the greenhouse effect took over, the sky is full of hydrocarbons and the ocean full of sludge. Nice place.”\nSo, if anything, CD Projekt’s vision of the gritty urban metropolis is too gritty, and not nearly grimy enough. Today’s patch should fix that. You can find the full patch notes on the official website.",

Advertorials should be, after all. Players will also get the obligatory Danny Trejo cameo (con el machete, of course), and a Rambo mission series whose premise sounds like it kinda works? Rambo himself doesn’t drop into the game — it’s a Yaran superfan who, despite the near total cutoff of the island (vis-a-vis Cuba), has followed the 1980s action series and become obsessed with the character.\n\n\nThe three crossovers, coming post launch, led off a roadmap video Ubisoft posted on Friday. Players will also get, free from day one, weekly cooperative multiplayer operations — they’re “insurgencies” and “special ops.”\nOf course, this is a Ubisoft joint, so there’s a season pass with premium post-launch stuff, too. As mentioned before, you’ll be going inside the minds of Pagan Min, Vaas, and Joseph Seed to learn more about how those three got so messed up.

Unlike some events, however, there will be no replays available for Operation: Sky Fire. The event will take place in its own separate playlist which will go live 30 minutes before the event is set to begin — which is probably when you’ll want to be online, based on the server queues that have happened in the past. \nThis new event also comes with a few unique warnings from Epic. According to the developer’s post on the Fortnite website, players should make sure that all of their challenges are completed before the event begins, and that all of their Battle Stars have been redeemed — otherwise they’ll automatically be redeemed, starting with the earliest available unlocks. Players will also need to complete all of their Superman quests before the event if they want to unlock all of his cosmetic goodies. \nFortnite Chapter 2 season 8 is set to begin sometime after Operation: Sky Fire, but just how soon after, and what happens next, are things we’ll have to find out after the event.",

But it was Homer, beloved cat of protagonist Frey, that stole the hearts of viewers. The problem came when fans started wondering, “What’s going to happen to Homer while Frey is out kicking ass the entire game?”\nOn Twitter and YouTube, fans seemed excited about Forspoken, but concerned about Homer. “What happens to the cat?!?!” they asked. “I need closure for Homer...” one fan pleaded. “I 100% agree with everyone else, I can’t handle the guilt of letting my cat starve to death in my apartment while I play with dragons,” worried another.\nBut a new tweet from the Forspoken Twitter account has soothed fans.\nThis is a Homer appreciation post.  \nP.S. Promise she's OK. pic.twitter.com/wyFXQ0Ue6p\n— Forspoken (@Forspoken) September 10, 2021\n\n\n\nHomer, the talkative Balinese house cat with big blue eyes, will not be starving to death during your journey as Frey, it seems. While assurances are certainly appreciated for those of us with animal anxiety, it’s still not clear what Homer will be up to. Will she adventure alongside Frey as some of the YouTube comments suggest? Or will Homer get to relax at home with a cat sitter? The answer we’re hoping for is probably quite different than the one Homer would want.\nForspoken is a third-person action game in which Frey enters a mysterious world called Athia and wields a magic bracelet to battle dragons with magic. Forspoken doesn’t have a release date yet, but Square Enix and Luminous Productions will release it for PlayStation 5 and Windows PC sometime in the spring of 2022.",

She’s 23 years-old, was raised by humans, and developed a reputation for murdering potential mates. But Walnut eventually found a good match in bird keeper Chris Crowe, a 42 year-old human who she has bonded with. Crowe, as part of his duties at the zoo, has embraced his role as Walnut’s mate in order to inseminate her with semen from a male crane.\nThat summer, however, Crowe noticed that Walnut seemed interested in, well, him. When Crowe stopped by her yard, she would bow her head and raise her wings — motions that Crowe now recognizes as the first moves of a mating dance. “At first, I thought that she was just excited to see me,” Crowe says. “But then I’d see the other pairs doing the same things…",

          "description": "A pair of 1300-year-old skis has been discovered in an ice field in Norway. They are believed to be the best-preserved ancient skis ever found — even the bindings are mostly intact. The first of the pair was found back in 2014 and its mate was recently retrieved, an expedition you can witness in the video above.\nIt has been seven years since the discovery of the first ski at the Digervarden ice patch. We have patiently monitored the melt of the ice patch, in case the second ski of the pair should melt out. We were back in 2016 for a general survey of the ice patch, but the ice had not retreated much then. This year, we could see on satellite imagery that the ice patch had retreated compared to 2014. We decided to send out an archaeologist to check it.\n\n\nOne of the things they were hoping to find is how the skier was able to maintain forward motion with the skis, especially uphill. Modern cross-country skis rely on a texture (or wax) on the bottom of the ski to grip the snow while downhill skiers can apply skins to their skis to climb uphill. More than a thousand years ago, the choice was texture or animal fur:\nOne of the questions raised by the ski found in 2014 was if it originally had fur on the underside. This has major implications for the use of the ski. There were no nail holes along the sides of the 2014 ski which would have been a clear sign of the fastening of the fur. However, fur can also be glued to the underside, so we could not rule it out.\nA furrow on the underside along the length of the ski, as you find on other prehistoric skis (and on modern cross-country skis), would solve the question. Such a furrow would have no function with an underside covered by fur. The 2014 ski did not show a furrow, but the new and better preserved ski does! So, probably no fur-lining.\n\n\n(thx, meg)\nTags: archaeology   skiing   video",

          "description": "Even for mathematically minded folks, statistics can be hard to grasp. Take statistical paradoxes for example: Simpson’s Paradox is a real mind-boggler. Ryan Anderson explains this paradox in a recent issue of Why is this interesting?\nIt’s simple to describe, yet it still stops me in my tracks when I see it in the wild. The paradox is that a measurable effect on a large population disappears, or even reverses when that population is split into subgroups. The cause of these results is almost always a material change in the denominators from one period to the next.\nShowing is easier than telling with paradoxes, so here is a classic example: In 1995 and 1996, David Justice had a higher batting average than Derek Jeter in each year. However, Jeter had a higher cumulative batting average over those two years.\n\n\nIt’s true; look:\n\nAnderson continues:\nHow does this work? Jeter’s 1996 stats accounted for over 92% of his total performance over the two years, as he was 20 years old and only called up to the major league for a few games in 1995. Meanwhile, Justice’s 1996 stats were only 25% of his total performance due to a separated shoulder he suffered barely two months into the season. So while Justice performed better on smaller sample size, Jeter’s 183 hits in 1996 were the strongest signal for overall performance.\n\n\nRead the rest of the piece; he goes on to connect statistical paradoxes to efforts to mislead people about the pandemic and vaccine effectiveness.\nTags: baseball   mathematics   Ryan Anderson   sports",

          "description": "Using data from Johns Hopkins, this time lapse video shows the spread of Covid-19 across the US from Feb 2020 to Sept 2021. This looks so much like small fires exploding into raging infernos and then dying down before flaring up all over again. Indeed, forest fire metaphors seem to be particularly useful in describing pandemics like this.\nThink of COVID-19 as a fire burning in a forest. All of us are trees. The R0 is the wind speed. The higher it is, the faster the fire tears through the forest. But just like a forest fire, COVID-19 needs fuel to keep going. We’re the fuel.\nIn other forest fire metaphorical scenarios, people are ‘kindling’, ‘sparks being thrown off’ (when infecting others) and ‘fuel’ (when becoming infected). In these cases, fire metaphors convey the dangers posed by people being in close proximity to one another, but without directly attributing blame: people are described as inanimate entities (trees, kindling, fuel) that are consumed by the fire they contribute to spread.\n\n\nSee also A Time Lapse World Map of Every Covid-19 Death (from July 2020).\nTags: Covid-19   death   infoviz   maps   time lapse   video",

They question why, for example, it differs from two contemporary copies made from Rubens’s original. The toes of Samson’s outstretched right foot, for example, are cropped in the National Gallery version, while they are shown in an engraving by Jacob Matham and a painting that depicts the Samson and Delilah hanging in Rockox’s home by Frans Francken the Younger.\n\n\n Tags: art   Peter Paul Rubens   video",

What would life on a flat Earth be like? Well for one thing, gravity would present some challenges. From a 2018 piece by Doug Main at the Columbia Climate School:\nPeople who believe in a flat Earth assume that gravity would pull straight down, but there’s no evidence to suggest it would work that way. What we know about gravity suggests it would pull toward the center of the disk. That means it would only pull straight down at one point on the center of the disk. As you got increasingly far from the center, gravity would tug more and more horizontally. This would have some strange impacts, like sucking all the water toward the center of the wor…",

This video documents how they do it.\nThe Nenet reindeer herders need to move their tent every few days throughout most of the year. Every time they migrate they must pack the whole tent away, drag it across the tundra on sledges, and erect it again in a fresh place, sometimes in temperatures of minus thirty degrees. Survival depends on working together as a team.\nAfter staying in the wooded taiga for two months they start to migrate north following the ancient paths of migrating reindeer (caribou). In four months they will travel up to 1200km and must pack and move every three to five days to keep up with their herd. They must reach their summer quarters before the snows melt and flood great rivers with icy waters too cold and deep for the calves, born along the way, to cross.\n\n\nSee also How to Build an Igloo.

The US is throwing too little money at high-tech, ultimately private sector solutions but much of the problem comes down to our underfunded public health system and “profoundly unequal society”.\n“To be ready for the next pandemic, we need to make sure that there’s an even footing in our societal structures,” Seema Mohapatra, a health-law expert at Indiana University, told me. That vision of preparedness is closer to what 19th-century thinkers lobbied for, and what the 20th century swept aside. It means shifting the spotlight away from pathogens themselves and onto the living and working conditions that allow pathogens to flourish. It means measuring preparedness not just in terms of syringes, sequencers, and supply chains but also in terms of paid sick leave, safe public housing, eviction moratoriums, decarceration, food assistance, and universal health care. It means accompanying mandates for social distancing and the like with financial assistance for those who might lose work, or free accommodation where exposed people can quarantine from their family. It means rebuilding the health policies that Reagan began shredding in the 1980s and that later administrations further frayed. It means restoring trust in government and community through public services. “It’s very hard to achieve effective containment when the people you’re working with don’t think you care about them,” Arrianna Marie Planey, a medical geographer at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, told me.\n\n\n Tags: Covid-19   Ed Yong   healthcare   politics   science   USA",

Whatever you find there, you can keep. But what are they really searching for?\nI came across an article about the Crater of Diamonds State Park in Arkansas, which I learned is the world’s only public diamond-bearing site. People from all walks of life search for diamonds atop this ancient volcanic crater, and it’s finders keepers. Some people find substantial diamonds, some don’t, and either way, it takes a lot of digging in the dirt. I was immediately hooked on the metaphor of this place.\nI was interested in the hope of treasure, the grittiness of searching, and what people there were actually looking for in their lives. Creatively, I wanted to push an interview-driven piece, especially one in which subjects are given freedom to take you where they want to go, rather than guiding interviews along a plot-driven track. Errol Morris’ Vernon, Florida was a huge inspiration for this approach.\n\n\nThat loudspeaker announcement right at the beginning is surreal — a great way to set the tone for the rest of the film.\nTags: Caitlyn Greene   diamonds   video",

Steger lives off the grid and uses the harvested ice for refrigeration — the ice keeps everything cool in the ice house for the whole year, until the next harvest.\nBest known for his legendary polar explorations, Will Steger’s life work grew out of a single log cabin he built after moving to the Minnesotan wilderness at age 25. Reliant on sustainable energy and natural commodities, Steger formed a community and culture based on the principle of mutuality. Central to Steger’s operation is the lost art of cutting ice for refrigeration. This annual harvest formed a tradition spanning fifty years that became known as the “Ice Ball”. While this old world technology inevitably became obsolete, its disappearance parallels a concerning loss of social interdependence in modern society.\n\n\nCome for the ice harvesting, stay for the wonderful Minnesotan accents.

Smallpox once killed 30% of the people who contracted the disease but through the invention of an effective, safe vaccine and an intense effort that began in the 1960s, smallpox was completely eradicated by 1980. In the 1980s, scientists discovered a hole in the ozone layer that protects the Earth from UV radiation; further depletion would have caused major problems with the world’s food supply and an epidemic of skin cancer. Forty years later, we’ve virtually eliminated the chemicals causing the depletion and ozone losses have stabilized and have recently shown improvement.\nSo how did we do it?

The project has been realized in partnership with the Centre des Monuments Nationaux and in coordination with the City of Paris. It also receives the support of the Centre Pompidou. The Arc de Triomphe is wrapped in 25,000 square meters of recyclable polypropylene fabric in silvery blue, and with 3,000 meters of red rope.\nIn 1961, three years after they met in Paris, Christo and Jeanne-Claude began creating works of art in public spaces. One of their projects was to wrap a public building. When he arrived in Paris, Christo rented a small room near the Arc de Triomphe and had been attracted by the monument ever since. In 1962, he made a photomontage of the Arc de Triomphe wrapped, seen from the Avenue Foch and, in 1988, a collage. 60 years later, the project will finally be concretized.\n\n\nJeanne-Claude died in 2009 and Christo followed in 2020, so the project was completed by their team according to their wishes.

Her early fusion of gospel, the blues, and the electric guitar (as on 1944’s Strange Things Happening Every Day, a contender for the first rock & roll record) had a huge influence on men like Little Richard, Chuck Berry, and Elvis Presley, who ended up winning much of the credit for this innovation. This 60-minute BBC documentary from 2011 is a good place to start learning about Tharpe — part 1 is embedded above and here are parts two, three, and four.\nI found this via Ted Mills at Open Culture, who writes:\nAs the doc makes clear, Tharpe had a rebellious streak, didn’t do what she was told, and pushed boundaries in a very segregated America. She invited the all-white Jordanaires to tour with her, surprising house managers and booking agents alike. And she carried on a love affair and creative partnership with fellow gospel singer Marie Knight for decades, very much on the down low.\nSo perhaps this is the reason Tharpe has not been on our collective radar — we’ve been slow to admit that rock guitar was created by a queer black woman devoted to the Lord.\n\n\nAnd if you want to see the whole clip of Tharpe performing Didn’t It Rain from the opening scene of the documentary, there’s really not a better way to spend eight minutes (bc you’ll probably want to watch it twice):\n\nDamn.\nTags: music   Rosetta Tharpe   video",

It shut down about 80 percent of the abortion services we provide. Anyone who suspects I have violated the new law can sue me for at least $10,000. They could also sue anybody who helps a person obtain an abortion past the new limit, including, apparently, the driver who brings a patient to my clinic.\nFor me, it is 1972 all over again.\nAnd that is why, on the morning of Sept. 6, I provided an abortion to a woman who, though still in her first trimester, was beyond the state’s new limit. I acted because I had a duty of care to this patient, as I do for all patients, and because she has a fundamental right to receive this care.\nI fully understood that there could be legal consequences — but I wanted to make sure that Texas didn’t get away with its bid to prevent this blatantly unconstitutional law from being tested.\n\n\nBraid concluded his piece: “I believe abortion is an essential part of health care.” Absolutely.\nTags: abortion   Alan Braid   medicine   politics   Texas",

I’m a community prepper. I’m not so interested in trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic situation if everyone around me is suffering. So I’m trying to figure out how to bring up the community so that they can all thrive.\n\n\nYou can learn more about Fletcher’s life and how he lives it on his website and check out his YouTube videos for more clever DIY tips.\nTags: Aaron Fletcher   video",

This video is like a private cooking class with a very thoughtful & knowledgable host — and it made me incredibly hungry. A good pairing might be Saxelby’s recent book, The New Rules of Cheese.\nBut….. at the first mention of the word “fridge”, I could not help but think of this classic interview with French marketing consultant Clotaire Rapaille: In America, the Cheese Is Dead.\nFor example, if I know that in America the cheese is dead, which means is pasteurized, which means legally dead and scientifically dead, and we don’t want any cheese that is alive, then I have to put that up front. I have to say this cheese is safe, is pasteurized, is wrapped up in plastic. I know that plastic is a body bag. You can put it in the fridge. I know the fridge is the morgue; that’s where you put the dead bodies. And so once you know that, this is the way you market cheese in America.\n\n\n Tags: Anne Saxelby   cheese   food   how to   video",

Two 443 meters straights, joined by parabolic bends, form a continuous track for testing the cars.\nOriginally, as soon as the cars left the assembly lines they could flow directly upward to the test track through the snail-shaped ramps completing the whole processing cycle inside the factory. Moreover, these spiraling ramps inside the building allowed the cars to be driven back down and into showrooms.\n\n\nThe track was a little over 1/2 mile long.

          "description": "For her project Topography of Tears, Rose-Lynn Fisher used a scanning electron microscope to photograph the crystalized patterns of dried human tears. Part of why the images all look different is because tears are made up of varying chemicals depending on why they’re made.\nScientifically, tears are divided into three different types, based on their origin. Both tears of grief and joy are psychic tears, triggered by extreme emotions, whether positive or negative. Basal tears are released continuously in tiny quantities (on average, 0.75 to 1.1 grams over a 24-hour period) to keep the cornea lubricated. Reflex tears are secreted in response to an irritant, like dust, onion vapors or tear gas.\nAll tears contain a variety of biological substances (including oils, antibodies and enzymes) suspended in salt water, but as Fisher saw, tears from each of the different categories include distinct molecules as well. Emotional tears, for instance, have been found to contain protein-based hormones including the neurotransmitter leucine enkephalin, a natural painkiller that is released when the body is under stress.\n\n\nThis project is also available in book form.

He was seventeen years old, and when his visa expired he became undocumented. He lived with an older brother and took classes day and night and through the summer in order to finish high school in two years. “I became a man the moment I set foot on U.S. soil, full of responsibility,” he told me. He started playing the violin a few years later, with teachers at the Harlem School of the Arts. He was soon practicing several hours a day and working long shifts at Pizza Hut. He felt that he was too old to train as a professional, but his practice had become central to his life: “Music was the escape, music was the goal. Music was what made me achieve great things,” he said. “The violin gives me a discipline where I feel I can conquer anything.”\n\n\n Tags: art   Haiti   Lydia Cornett   music   NYC   video   Yves Deshommes",

          "description": "The Wire creator David Simon wrote about his friend and colleague Michael K. Williams, who died suddenly last week at the age of 54. The Question Michael K. Williams Asked Me Before Every Season of ‘The Wire’:\nAnd from that moment forward, his questions about our drama and its purposes were those of someone sharing the whole of the journey. It became something of a ritual with us: To begin every season that followed, Michael K. Williams would walk into the writers’ office and sit on the couch.\n“So,” he would ask, “what are we going to say this year?”\nHe gave us an astounding gift — an act of faith from a magnificent actor who could have played his hand very differently. Television usually chases its audience — if they love them some Omar, you feed them more Omar. If they can’t stop looking at Stringer, you write more Stringer. Never mind story and theme.\nInstead, Mike bent his beautiful mind to a task that even the best writers and show runners often avoid. He thought about the whole story, the whole of the work.\nPerhaps more than any in that talented cast, I came to trust Mike to speak publicly to our drama and its purposes, to take personal pride in all that we were trying, however improbably, to build. He became increasingly political as the show aged, and in interviews took to addressing societal and political issues, his arguments ranging well beyond Omar’s arc.\n“I started to realize that, oh, this is not about me,” Williams once told an interviewer, looking back. “It had everything to do with … just great tapestry, this great narrative of social issues … things that are wrong in our country.”\n\n\nSee also tributes from Wendell Pierce and other actors & filmmakers who worked with Williams.\nTags: David Simon   Michael K.

          "description": "Black Film Archive is a collection of links to films made by Black filmmakers & actors from 1915 to 1979 that are available to stream online. Maya Cade writes about why she created this archive.\nThe films collected on Black Film Archive have something significant to say about the Black experience; speak to Black audiences; and/or have a Black star, writer, producer, or director. This criterion for selection is as broad and inclusive as possible, allowing the site to cover the widest range of what a Black film can be.\nThe films listed here should be considered in conversation with each other, as visions of Black being on film across time. They express what only film can: social, anthropological, and aesthetic looks at the changing face of Black expression (or white attitudes about Black expression, which are inescapable given the whiteness of decision-makers in the film industry). \nFilms, by their very nature, require a connection between creator and audience. This relationship provides a common thread that is understood through conventional and lived knowledge to form thought and to consider. Not every filmmaker is speaking directly to Blackness or Black people or has the intention to. Some films listed carry a Black face to get their message across. But presented here, these films offer a full look into the Black experience, inferred or real, on-screen.\n\n\nWhat a great open resource — exactly what the internet is for. You can read more about the archive on Vulture and NPR.\nTags: lists   Maya Cade   movies",

          "description": "Documentaries about mushrooms like Fantastic Fungi are interesting but it turns out that short documentaries about how mushroom documentaries are made are fascinating as well. For this short video, Wired talked to Louie Schwartzberg about how mushroom time lapses are filmed. I don’t know why I assumed they filmed these outside…of course they are done indoors to help control lighting, weather, and other factors (like rogue wildlife). And after decades of working on nature films, Schwartzberg has integrated his process deeply into his life:\nI realized I’ve turned it into a spiritual practice. It actually literally gets me up in the morning because as soon as I’m out of bed, I’m thinking ooh, “I wonder what the flower did last night? Is it still in frame? Is it in focus?”\nI have to imagine what the framing and the composition is going to look like tomorrow, or two days from now, or a week from now. That is a transformational experience because you have to put your mind into the mindset and the intention of the flower or the fungi, thinking where it’s going to grow, how big will it get. And if you’re right, boy, it’s a rush. If you’re wrong, it means you just gotta do it all over again.\n\n\nThis was surprisingly philosophical in parts.\nTags: Fantastic Fungi   video",

          "description": "Because of humans, most of the world’s oyster reefs have disappeared over the last 200 years. Now, some groups around the world are trying to put some of them back. In addition to providing water filtration and habitats for other animals, offshore oyster reefs can help slow long-term erosion by acting as living breakwater structures that partially deflect waves during storm surges.\nIn the last century, 85% of the world’s oyster reefs have vanished. And we’re only recently beginning to understand what that’s cost us: While they don’t look incredibly appealing from the shore, oysters are vital to bays and waterways around the world. A single oyster can filter up to 50 gallons of water every day. And over time, oysters form incredible reef structures that double as habitats for various species of fish, crabs, and other animals. In their absence, our coastlines have suffered.\nNow, several projects from New York to the Gulf of Mexico and Bangladesh are aiming to bring the oysters back. Because not only are oysters vital ecosystems; they can also protect us from the rising oceans by acting as breakwaters, deflecting waves before they hit the shore. It won’t stop the seas from rising — but embracing living shorelines could help protect us from what’s to come.\n\n\n(via the kid should see this)\nTags: food   global warming   oysters   video",

The music came to him naturally. He is no ordinary street musician, however, and his one-string guitar is not a gimmick. Brushy is a talented singer-songwriter, with a powerful voice and a musical sensibility that transcends his bare-bones minimalism.\n\n\nIn addition to his NPR Tiny Desk Concert above, this video of Brushy performing Chicken in The Corn on his one-string has been viewed over 50 million times.\nSee also Gasper Nali and His Homemade [One-String] Bass Guitar.

Evan Puschak’s Nerdwriter is a particular favorite guiding light and in his latest video, he talks about Agnès Varda’s Cléo from 5 to 7, a film I now want to watch as soon as possible. A synopsis via Wikipedia:\nCléo from 5 to 7 follows a pop singer through two extraordinary hours in which she awaits the results of a recent biopsy. The film is superficially about a woman coming to terms with her mortality, which is a common auteurist trait for Varda. On a deeper level, Cléo from 5 to 7 confronts the traditionally objectified woman by giving Cléo her own vision. She cannot be constructed through the gaze of others, which is often represented through a motif of reflections and Cléo’s ability to strip her body of “to-be-looked-at-ness” attributes (such as clothing or wigs). Stylistically, Cléo from 5 to 7 mixes documentary and fiction, as had La Pointe Courte. The film represents diegetic action said to occur between 5 and 7 p.m., although its run-time is 89 minutes.\n\n\nI’ve added Cléo from 5 to 7 to my HBO Max queue but you can also find it on Kanopy (accessible with a library card) and The Criterion Channel.\nTags: Agnes Varda   Cleo from 5 to 7   Evan Puschak   film school   movies   video",

Gorman read Herman Melville’s masterpiece last year and made these maps & graphics to help him make sense of it.\nI read Moby-Dick in April 2020. For weeks afterward, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I started making maps and diagrams as a way to figure it out.\nMoby-Dick is infamous for its digressions. Throughout the book, the narrator disrupts the plot with contemplations, calculations, and categorizations. He ruminates on the White Whale, and the ocean, and human psychology, and the night sky, and how it all relates back to the mystery of the unknown. His narration feels like a twisting-turning struggle to explain everything.\nReading Moby-Dick actually made me feel like that-like I’d mentally absorbed its spin-cycle style. I developed a case of “Kaleidoscope Brain.” The maps I was making were obsessive and encyclopedic. They were newer and weirder and they digressed beyond straightforward geography.\n\n\nThe book is available as a free download on Gorman’s Patreon — support his efforts if you find them valuable!\nAbove, from top to bottom: the letters of the alphabet in order of their appearance in the book, the constellation Cetus (aka “The Whale”), every color in the book.\nTags: books   design   Herman Melville   infoviz   Moby Dick   Peter Gorman   remix",

I’m feeling my way to that destination, which is years off, surely, and I just hope to manage it gracefully. (I don’t know of any role models with this.)\nAnyway.

The Flyers are set to be back on the ice starting on Thursday. We’ll see them broken up into three groups for regular on-ice sessions for the first three days of camp, and then they’ll add a couple of scrimmages on top of those sessions on Sunday and Monday, ahead of Tuesday’s preseason kickoff against the Islanders. \nYou can find the full schedule for here, and the full roster for camp can be found here. \nThe Flyers have also announced the following injury updates:\nKevin Hayes (abdominal surgery on 9/21 - out 6-8 weeks)\nSamuel Morin (right knee surgery to have loose bodies removed on 9/10 - out 6-8 weeks)\nWade Allison (right ankle sprain - out indefinitely)\nZayde Wisdom (shoulder surgery - out indefinitely)\nCooper Zech (upper body - out 6-8 weeks)\nNot all of this is surprising: we knew that Wisdom would be out for a while, and there had been rumors about Morin’s status kicking around for the last little bit here. But there are a few takeaways. The ankle injury for Allison is still not great, but considering how ugly the play he was injured on looked, and the knee issues he’s had in the past, an ankle injury feels like a bit of a bullet dodged, all things considered. \nThe Hayes news is the big surprise, and that certainly complicates things. The Flyers’ center situation heading into camp already looked to be a bit up in the air, and a lot was going to depend on those battles in camp to solidify those positions, and now they seem to be even more wide open. With Hayes out (and to a degree, Allison as well) this certainly opens up the door for some prospects like Morgan Frost and Tanner Laczynski, who have been impressing in development and rookie camps, to push hard for a spot, and reasonably grab one. \nThings are getting really interesting around here, and while it feels like we say this every year, this camp is going to be one to keep an eye on.",

These players, combined with those expected to breakout, should give the Flyers the extra juice needed to get over the hump in a crowded division and back into the Stanley Cup playoffs. \n\n\nBut enough chatter, let’s dive into five Flyers poised for bounce back seasons in 2021-22 — starting with ar…",

The results are in and we’ll be revealing the rankings in the coming weeks. One top player who graduated from the 25U25 this year is Travis Sanheim, and he’s a complicated player. [BSH]\n*Sticking with prospects here, Charlie’s series on the Flyers’ current crop of prospects continues with part one of his interview with Brent Flahr, who filled us in on how the forwards are progressing. [The Athletic]\n*Last season’s reviews roll on, this time we’ve got Samuel Morin. [BSH]\n*Our pals over at Fear The Fin took a stab at previewing the upcoming season for the Flyers, with some insight into what we can expect from new backup goalie Martin Jones. [Fear The Fin]\n*Speaking of, the Flyers’ goalie coach is extremely confident that Jones is going to turn things around here in Philly. [Inquirer]\n*The Metro Division will be without one of its best players to start the season. Which is great for the Flyers. [Pensburgh]\n*There are still a number of very talented RFAs without contracts right now. After the whole offer sheet thing the other day you would think there’d be some movement. Not yet! [ProHockeyTalk]\n*And finally, a lot of attention is paid to the NHL’s probably-unbreakable records. With good reason! They are pretty amazing, usually! But what about the records that CAN be broken? And probably will be soon? DGBs got you. [The Athletic]",

What does he bring to the table?\n Seven years after being drafted 17th overall by the Philadelphia Flyers in the 2014 NHL entry draft, Travis Sanheim has become a polarizing figure amongst the fanbase.\nThe reasons are obvious enough as Sanheim hasn’t exactly cemented himself as a star in the league while seemingly possessing a lot of the tools necessary to do so. From the outside looking in, that’s seemingly caused a large portion of the fanbase to tire of Sanheim over the last few seasons. He’s not a physical player despite being a 6’3” defender, and that seems to be brought up a lot by his detractors, but he’s probably a lot better than he gets credit for. \nIt’s likely not all t…",

Not to go and dive into the deep pool of the psychology of fan-thought, but Morin was once thought to be one of the rare players that was set to be the next level of physical defenseman that can still play the game of hockey without their knees combusting every single time they try to skate in smooth strides.\nThe Philadelphia Flyers certainly drafted him because he was (and still is) a 6-foot-6 defenseman.

          "description": "Durham’s City Council staggers its elections and its six council members, plus the mayor, each serve two-year terms. This year, the mayor’s seat is wide open, after incumbent mayor Steve Schewel declined to run for re-election to a third term. Wards I, II, and III also feature races, with incumbent council members seeking re-election in Wards I and II. A primary election for mayor and seats for Wards I and II take place October 5, with the top two vote getters in each race advancing to the general election on November 2. Early voting in Durham’s municipal primary begins next week for these three seats, and we will make endorsements in all three races. The Ward III seat drew only two candidates, so they will automatically advance to the general election ballot. We will not endorse in this race as candidate AJ Williams is the son of our staff writer, Thomasi McDonald, who covers Durham. Read questionnaires from some of the candidates below and check back this Wednesday for our endorsements!",

          "description": "Italians who don’t know how to have fun released a new EP! I remember this band since they released their debut 1 sided LP… and must say that new material is f***g amazing! With each new release, the powerviolence of this band becomes stronger and stronger. Don`t be fooled with such simple cover art… the main hell is inside!
